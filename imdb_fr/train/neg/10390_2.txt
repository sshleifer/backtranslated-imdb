I just rented and watched this movie just to see what it's all about. So here are my reactions to this. It's easy to see that it's a low budget movie with bad actors. The main plot of this film is about a woman who takes revenge on her rapists. This concept, if done right, could easily become a really challenging movie. However, the film does not shock me at all. It just bothered me. This film could be easily reduced to less than 45 minutes. All the scenes are mainly there to mark the time, like these scenes and some scenes that I described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find rape scenes quite tame. I do not know if I watched the cut or uncut version, if there really is such a version. I also found many holes in the plot already badly written. Here's a list: <br /> <br /> Why do not the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she comes out of her house to discover the nature of these noises? It would be an excellent time. <br /> <br /> Why do not they rape her as a group, instead of delaying the pleasure of some rapists and prolonging Jennifer's ordeal for so long? It would probably be more shocking and disturbing in this way. <br /> <br /> I found it really stupid that the rapists leave her in the forest and go home. Maybe to show that these rapists are really fools. <br /> <br /> These rapists must at least know that if you want to do the dirty work, they should not send a cowardly fool to do it. <Br /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? Which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's minds, especially for a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did not these rapists feel the danger when they saw that Jennifer was alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really amazing that a lady as thin as Camille can shoot a tree man and hang him. ************************ Finishes spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, this The film is not without merit, Camille Keaton is beautiful and I hear one of the funniest replies I heard recently when Matthew protested that he was coming home and killing Jennifer. Why me? Why me, I did not even come !!!
