What was Steven Seagal thinking? I want to say first of all I love Seagal. I love all his films until the mid-2000s. His debut is among the best of its kind. This does not correspond to his excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) should be a silly action movie starring Seagal in a typical one-line ass kick. However, what we get is a crime mystery, on the verge of a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is still in the shadows because of its weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who turn into superhuman when they take a drug. What happened in this movie? The dubbing of Seagal is a shame, a disaster and a shame. Why double the man? The story is terrible. It earned me a 2/10 because of the scene where Seagal asked for help despite his army, and a hilarious fight scene in which Seagal sweeps his hands like a girl in front of the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street," says Seagal in this movie ... well, forget Steven's revenge, you need redemption!
