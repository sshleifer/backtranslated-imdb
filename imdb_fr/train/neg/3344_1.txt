I should start by saying that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man has discovered some of the funniest action shots imaginable and Detention is probably my favorite. * Spoiler * even if there is no Dolph spoliator since the scripts are so absurd at first: a hunting scene with a disabled kid carrying a pistol against a guy in Harley with a machine gun, across a corridor of the school and the kid wins? Good luck, the Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the bursts of laughter, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: Awesome movie that guarantees a laugh. I recommend inviting friends for this and forcing them to get through. Hilarious.
