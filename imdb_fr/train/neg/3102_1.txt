No matter how you watch this movie, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you consider it a horror, then this is a scary movie in which the monsters are puppets. > If you think of it as a comedy, then you will notice that most of the humor falls flat and is simply lame. <br /> <br /> If it's a romance, you'll wonder why a guy would stay with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you consider it an action you can not really shoot for the weeping hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie does not succeed. remote entertaining. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious puppets and this movie was another attempt of a Gremlins type movie. This, however, has the worst monsters of this kind. The creatures looked pretty good, the Ghoulies too, and even the Munchies puppets were better than these. The characters in this film are really inimitable. The hero is a security guard, his girlfriend always complains, they have a tramp friend who has a military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At some point in the film, the hero and the military fight against rakes ... This film is totally stupid. I love the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but rather a restaurant) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21 years old. Give me a break, I'm 25 years old and I look younger than one of them.
