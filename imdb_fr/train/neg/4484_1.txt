As soon as I started seeing posters and hearing about this movie, I was immediately excited. The matrix was amazing to see and I can not wait to see the second one, especially after I started seeing the trailers in other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointed, as did many other movie buffs with me. While the action scenes in the movie were incredible, as always, they were simply too few. In the first film, it seemed that there was constant fighting, but the second took a much more predominant (and much more unfortunate) point of view. To sum up the plot, there was not much that was not planned. The machines were digging towards Zion with the intention of destroying it (it's not a spoiler, everyone saw it in the commercials). The dialogue of the film was absolutely horrendous. Unless you're a major in psychology, you probably will not understand most of the lyrics, and because of that, it just will not interest them. It has become something of a romantic film with the projection of events occurring in the lives and relationships of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, as mean as he was in the first film, seemed to have a religious preaching. Personally, I do not need to hear about it or pay money to listen to it. The film was a big waste of time and I do not think I can watch the first movie anymore. The constantly boring and arid dialogues and monologues of all the characters made me quickly lose interest in the film, and the few good fight scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end immediately pushed back. Which movie ends with "To Be Concluded"? How original these people are. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to get to that one. In conclusion, the film was bad and it's the end.
