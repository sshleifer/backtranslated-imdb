I saw this in an arty cinema that also featured "Last Days" and Charlie Chaplin movies. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give a chance to "Immortal". I almost got out of this movie and I like science fiction! The story takes place in a futuristic New York City, filled with Blade Runner-style sky commercials and similar cloning / man-made debates. Unfortunately, the script was not sufficiently condensed for a one-hour, forty-five minute movie. Three groups exist in this world: humans, artificial humans and Egyptian gods. Artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city. Humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (inspired by the Khufu Great Pyramid and whose exterior is deteriorated, leaving a smooth "cap" on the pyramid.A futuristic pyramid floating would not it be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and no one on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not bore you with what is called intrigue, but there are many useless and bloody scenes. As I said, the movie seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film, credits were cited for the UK, France and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who do not speak French. It is obvious that their French dialogue has been doubled. It's a distraction, and I also thought that switching between real humans and animations was distracting enough. It does not help that the animations are mediocre - no better than a video game. Skip this one.
