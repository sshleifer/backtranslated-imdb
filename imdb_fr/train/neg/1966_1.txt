I was fooled by seeing this movie after reading a positive review of another website and the man was I p.o'd !!! It took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up on the shelf because I did not want anyone to see me. then 10 extra minutes to have the courage to wear it at the counter and use real money to rent it. I thought that all my stress would be profitable when I came home and watched the movie because the review I read said that the movie was a pleasant surprise. what joke! If you can spend the first hour of the movie, then you're in luck! b / c it is only then that the film turns to horror. do not bother with that one, your best to watch "dankness falls"
