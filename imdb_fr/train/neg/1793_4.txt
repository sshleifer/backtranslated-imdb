An interesting concept that vampirism has something to do with a virus (but has already been repeated many times) Overall, the film is too long and drags a bit. The assembly could have been tighter. I'm sorry to hear about the credit problem. Maybe the film was rushed to the market. The lighting was too dark in some places. But the worst technical problem is audio. The level was enough to hear the dialogue, but most interiors echo, which is very distracting. Either they did not pay attention when recording, or the mix of the sound could have been better. Also too much background noise has passed. They should have asked someone to make sound effects for the martial arts scenes. The clatter of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the fight scenes, the editing had to be tighter. <br /> <br /> The acting game was also a little flat. I'm sorry, but when I see the same person writing and playing in a movie, it's a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort, so I gave him a 4.
