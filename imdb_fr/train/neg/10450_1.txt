This movie is the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie". I laughed during the whole movie instead of being scared. It was amusing to see how the serpents were looking for a part of the passenger's body to attack, for example the eye, the tongue, the butt, the breast. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that snakes will not remain attached to the body once they bite. For each particular scene, the snakes would bite the passengers and stay on the body, biting the person. I think the producer did not study his information about snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I wasted my money on this movie. So I do not recommend this movie trust, wait until it's at the movies or rent it.
