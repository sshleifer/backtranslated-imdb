American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy without a plot and with some really smart jokes. On the other side, it's porn that is a bit too soft-core to actually attract viewers. Essentially, Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others simply lame with humor - with a few thin plot points in a cohesive effort. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most of the developments are based on Naked Mile's knowledge and the "important" scenes of the plot are so far apart that one wonders why writers have even felt the need to a story. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I did not go into this film without expectations. I liked the three original American Pie movies and thought that Band Camp and Naked Mile were real rental companies. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, so when I saw some of the same characters coming back for Beta House, I was excited to see this movie. I was aware that there would be many scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in different forms. And it suited me, because in the past, these scenes were supported by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as if writers have forgotten why the formula of other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in nudity that they forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This film is a disappointment and is not worth a dollar rental. The jokes are void, the story is non-existent and the porn aspect is too docile if it's all that really matters to you.
