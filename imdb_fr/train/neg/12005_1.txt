We have all seen endless epics in our day, but this one surpasses them all! The film is so long and so slow that, to put things into perspective, I felt much older when I walked out of the movie theater than I had entered. After almost 4 hours, it would have been transformed into a TV series. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace. Nikhil Advani articulated the plot around 6 love stories and he can not do justice to any of them ... There is no interconnection between them to begin, and the links shown during the The last 20 minutes just seem to have to connect the story. <br /> <br /> The situation is aggravated by stupid dialogues (most of them repeated in Hindi cinema over the years) and stunning cinematography. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize she really needs to play it. Role rather than just glam on the screen ... A total mess of beauty without acting talent. <br /> <br /> And then there is Govinda & My-Face-Twists-Better-Jim -carrey Akshay Khanna who is dying to irritate the already tired spectators. <br /> <br /> Only the good side in the film is John & Vidya's love story and Sohail & Isha's beautiful comedy / comedy. But they are so good in their roles that just these two couples could have justified the film without blurring it with other characters. Their brilliance is lost in the midst of other intrigues of inferior quality. <br /> <br /> I guess the director was shooting two separate movies (maybe more!) And some beginner assistants have mixed all the recordings, so the director has no choice of anything show as a single film ... <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you want to test your patience !!!
