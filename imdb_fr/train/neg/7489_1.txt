American movies about the war and the Nazis just can not be good. They can not help but become idiots and follow an agenda. All the Nazis are mean, crazy, too proud, and the Americans are so modest, but also capable, sensitive and human. Come on, stop this bullshit. The main character says something like "by this trial, we must make war of aggression a crime". Is America a peaceful nation with its world's No. 1 billion "defense" budget of $ 420 billion (China No. 2 with only $ 51 billion)? Is it just spent in that without any ... KING? Why portray America as a peaceful nation when it is not? I do not really like movies that have an agenda - they throw art into hell and try to persuade us to believe in something. Hollywood should put a label on the movies, just as record companies have this label "parental advice". We should have a "bullshit notice", a "propaganda notice" or a "politically correct opinion" label on some films. This is one of them.
