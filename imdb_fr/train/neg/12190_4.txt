One of the worst in Scorsese. An average thriller; The only thing to recommend is De Niro who plays the psychopath. The final is typically of this kind, ie on the fly, with yet another villain almost invincible, insensitive to pain. I did not like the original 60s, and this version was not really an improvement. I have no idea why Scorsese lost his time on a remake. Again, given the seriousness of her recent films (I'm talking about her dull Buddhist film and all those with her new favorite actress, the blonde girl Di Caprio), it's not even so bad by comparison. And considering that Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... it could have been a lot worse.
