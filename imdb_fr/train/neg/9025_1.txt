Sorry, this movie is just a cheap TV show. I have seen a lot of promotional material and I am waiting for a professional movie like "Stormriders". I was introduced to a low budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No atmosphere, very boring, more than worse Fight-Scenes. Some good ideas - no more. I hope I will have the chance to make a film like this, then I will show how to make such a movie! "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad english!
