An OK film, shot in Mexico, on a hit-man (Scott Glenn) that hits a struggling writer and his Mexican friend after a hit. He pays them to take him to the border ?? but things get out of hand. <br /> <br /> It starts pretty well, but struggles quickly and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The eventual relationship Twist is badly set up and hard to believe. His lack of passion and his lack of reason to leave one man for another made him ridiculous - and the end was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the American agent on the hit-man's track, but he seems a bit confused about the slowness and slow scenario ...
