Closer to reality and containing more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a dull sight. Again, this photo is just taking advantage of the craze for the first time, but at least we get some entertainment in the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all grew up in Queens, New York. Everyone has their own talent. One is a hustler, another dj, another artist who creates "engravers", while little brother Lee is a very sexy "hip hop" dancer. <br /> <br /> Lathan fails to arouse real public interest. the story however, and his young cast are also struggling with their characters. That's why it's almost entirely dedicated to funky music and "cool" dancing to save the day. <br /> <br /> The choreography is again accurate, both for clubs and street scenes, but that is not enough, in itself "Beat Street" at higher heights. Unfortunately, the film really falls flat late, after hinting a glimmer of hope that it could become interesting. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
