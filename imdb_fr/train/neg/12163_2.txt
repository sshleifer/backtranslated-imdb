The absolutely putrid slasher movie does not have a quality that redeems. She invited camp counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson, the killer, her jokes when she wastes people are not even amusing) on ​​the warpath, killing teenagers who are a bit naughty or resisting her request for good conduct. We cover a whole range of boring and clichy murders, such as the murder of a glove looking for his claw glove Freddy, a kid who is cut up, a girl who gets banged, who gets fucked in the crapper (filled with leeches), whoever is roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> He does not have an original idea to offer and is a waste of time. That's unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's tits (who plays Ally slut). Most violence occurs off screen, so that will not be enough.
