Another cult strikes again. This is not a spoiler, because the real end comes after you have researched the people who brought this infomercial too long and pseudo-scientific ... The School of Lights Ramtha. <br /> <br /> When a religion / philosophy needs to hide behind an OZ-like trick screen, I'm leaving. Thank you Ramtha I watched a borrowed copy of this film on the recommendation of a "friend" ... wasting valuable resources for this new-age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I just hope they "really believe they can walk on the water" enough to follow that direction to its "logical" conclusion ... in other words; to walk, to drown ... or to be quiet :-) As a film ... it deserves a strong "1" for its entertainment value, especially for the creation of the most hateful character in the film's history (the roommate of the photographer ... eeeeeek!). If you have to watch this movie, take it to one of the brainwashing experts who recommended it.
