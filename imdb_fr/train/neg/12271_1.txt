Writer Lisa Lutz started writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 <br /> <br /> Is she even in business? If someone gives him another chance after this shit, she is ready to receive the award for the Lucky Person Of Ever. This movie is not afraid of the end ... He never ceases to be amazed that his tour in movie ... did they make this writer differ a bit? Seriously? I can write better shit than that during my sleep. <br /> <br /> OK, how many lines do I have to type? I do not understand at all. I guess I'm a beginner. I guess I do not understand why there should be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a quota? Seriously, I do not care if you have a sentence of a word ... or even an answer in one word. I mean, come on? <br /> <br /> Thank you ... is it enough, anyway? <br /> <br /> This film is worthless.
