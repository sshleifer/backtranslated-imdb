In Texas, seven friends gather at a bar to celebrate Halloween night before heading to a party. Meanwhile, they call the pirate radio American Nightmare for pleasure and confess their deepest fears. A serial killer, who listens to their confessions, realizes their nightmares, killing them sadistically. "American Nightmare" is a strange, low budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without any explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday 13. Then the story moves in a bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From that moment, the story has great potential and the unknown distribution has a very reasonable performance, also showing beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of production of C. However, the end of the Scenario provides no explanation for the death instinct and motivations of Nurse Jane Toppan's behavior, giving the impression that the budget ended before the filming was completed. With a better start and a better conclusion, this strange story would be a good slasher movie on a budget. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
