In Bridgeport, disturbed high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she sees him murdering his family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, traumatized Donna feels better, but is still under psychological treatment and taking medication. At her prom, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard escaped from prison and is staying on the same floor of the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing his friends and the staff of the hotel that runs through it. <br /> <br /> The oblique slash "Prom Night" is a collection of shots with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is superficial and stupid, with a bad game of Johnathon Schaech in the role of a mad killer. The predictable scenario is incredible because it is possible to predict what will happen in the next scenes. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Dead Convida Para Dan√ßar" ("Death invites to dance")
