I saw "Shiner" on DVD. While watching the movie, I thought, "It's a really bad porn movie without porn." I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has real problems." Then I watched director / screenwriter Carlson explain his process as a peculiarity. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to slip away. They are slightly attractive. There is frontal and complete nudity. These factors probably explain that the film was seen. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing element of the film is the denigration of homosexuals and the subsequent denigration of homosexuals of the same victim who tries unnecessarily to avenge his attackers, the two drunken losers. Not only is the subject treated absurdly and badly from the technical point of view, but the acting is horribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there is the boxers theme. It's really crazy, not just absurd. This stout boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a boy mom in the flesh who works on the parking of his gym. This is LA, notice. The boxer is so traumatized that he comes to the stalker, undresses in front of him and gets excited in the process. <br /> <br /> All I can say is why a boxer who is in the heart of an exhibitionist being so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It just does not make sense. And, I'm afraid some psycho-dynamics make sense if you take the time to read them. However, bad scripts rarely make sense. <br /> <br /> The director / scriptwriter seems to have thought that this film represented a considerable minority within the gay community. Well, he can be right, I guess. We may never know it, because this minority would be so dysfunctional that it could not get organized enough to access an obscure gay movie festival or a DVD store, the only two places they could find this turkey. Thank goodness for that.
