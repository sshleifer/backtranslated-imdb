The title had seduced me ... I was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism. I had rather a rather boring and uninteresting story about a rowdy Scot. <br /> <br /> The main character does not get much psychological depth, unless you want to classify teenage cheesy poetry as psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because the heart of the story could have been good, with a better effort to describe the inner feelings. of a man who has had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems more like "I am like I am because I am like that". And the ridiculously bad attempt to give a sort of poetic touch to a man of the lower class makes matters worse. By resorting to the cursed poet's overused clich√©, a quick fix, an inexpensive way to give the impression of a dull film to an intelligent, artistic and meaningful appearance. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not much intelligent, artistic or meaningful ... The main character does not evolve at all and the weak attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Just as the initial attempt went completely impromptu. <br /> <br /> The film borrows enormously from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but it finally fails to regain their size, not even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson has focused too much on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest, giving us a movie that is pleasing to the eye but tasteless to the brain.
