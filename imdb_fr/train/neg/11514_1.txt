No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, it was because they both thought it would make their film career easier. If you went through the show watching "Swept Away", then you know that at this level it was a match made in hell. After almost 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "grant", as she might have said in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can not go out on her own long enough to deliver a performance that anyone who tastes might even call it decent. And that's what makes people so much less attracted to her on screen: that visceral feeling that her ego is so swollen that it stops her from just letting go and connecting with her audience. If there is justice in this universe, she missed her last chance.
