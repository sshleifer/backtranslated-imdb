Martin Weisz, who directed the movie "Rohtenburg", will take the heat with Wes Craven for another shabby "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an incredible story and a dog with a flashback, will be erased forever by this more polished remake (name only). A group of National Guards (and women) are sent to a desert search area surrounded by mutant hills. One by one, the soldiers of the weekend are kidnapped. That's all. There is hardcore violence and a brutal rape scene, but there are very few other things to be enthusiastic about. The "heroes" of the film are the usual clich√©s and the mutants, far from the original "family" of Craven, resemble for the most part Brian Thompson of "Cobra" and some creatures that Stan Winston had left of the shooting "Wrong Turn ". Much of the action takes place in caves, like "The Descent", and is well drawn by Sam McCurdy. A ludicrous aspect is the addition by Wes and Jonathan Craven of a friendly mutant patrolling his cave as Leatherface in Hooper's original "Chainsaw". Weisz will be blamed for this terrifying debacle, but he's not really at fault, because he's doing his best to keep the suspense alive and get some fresh air out of artificial situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.
