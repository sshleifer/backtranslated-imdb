"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but nobody wanted it that way. It was a slapstick down, but he had brains. There was a very intelligent script with definable characters and a funny conclusion. People came out of the theater smiling. "Hooper" does not provide any of this. There is no reason to smile. If it's supposed to be a tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it makes them terribly lazy by only providing them with poorly choreographed combat scenes and one of the least convincing car jumps I've ever seen. All this looks fake, badly filmed almost on purpose. Poor Sally Field (as a girlfriend who wrings her hand) is given her weaker role, without a fun or clever line ("If you make that jump, I will not be here when you come back"). Burt Reynolds continues to look at the camera and blink, but the joke is about anyone passing through "Hooper". * from ****
