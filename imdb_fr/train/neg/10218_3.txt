** Spoilers contains ** <br /> <br /> From different sources, I learned that this movie was controversial and that its ending was particularly horrible. What I did not expect is the change of total transfer to about twenty minutes from the end. What begins as a typical Indian cowboy / western suddenly turns into a very boring "comedy" about Honus (Peter Strauss's Soldier Blue) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) escaping an assault on the Cheyenne cavalry . The majority of the film then focuses on these two incompatibles, hence the rise of the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then shows up and removes them both for no apparent reason. They then escape and both go (separately) to the base of the cavalry on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta was married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs, she escapes from the cavalry base and rejoins them. So far, so ordinary. Then comes the end. After having endured well over an hour of bad acting involving a clich√©, the film is then transformed into an over-exploitation involving among other things a beheading and a child shot in the head. Similarities can be drawn with Wild Bunch at this stage of the film, but Wild Bunch kept the same tone and did not resort to extreme and gratuitous violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, which also completely changed tactics for a shock. I did not hate Soldier Blue and did not find the end particularly unsettling, but I found it just dull enough with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a movie with a really disturbing slaughter of innocents, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.
