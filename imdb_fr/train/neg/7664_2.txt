Spoilers to come, but is it really important? Have you ever read a movie review entirely composed of questions? Could it be that? Why did an ancient civilization burst artefacts around the world? Why has this question never answered? Why was the opening text inconsistent? Why a nun (she looked nice!) Would she have given 20 orphans to a madman? Has there ever been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's wells come out in the yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly appear in Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist open a solid gold chest obviously with a pestle hammer? Why would modern computers always display green grid outlines, dating back to the pre-Tron era, with few "beeps"? And do all the explosive movie timers need digital screens? Why NOTHING in this film does not make sense?
