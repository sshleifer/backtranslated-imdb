I bought this movie from Gamestop's used movie basket and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is delayed and they use as ten different monkeys in the whole film that are hardly alike. Not to mention that they use a dumb stuntman who is just a little guy in a suit making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey. <br /> <br /> The director more than likely committed a murder-suicide with chimpanzees after the launch of the film in preview for another low-rent film, Warner Bros. and he owes some money to the studio. It does not help either to say that he was not even infamous for his horrendous work, that he was not even known to have produced a poo-chute movie. <br /> <br /> Why was this film ever shot?
