for a long time, I was eager to see this movie. Here in Latin America, no Oriental film is distributed in cinemas. We can find some of these films in underground stores and I just found Avalon. good, but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and insane, just stupid, with a lot of useless scenes and a boring story. I'm wasting my time even writing on this movie. Sorry but that's the truth.
