I filmed this film in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning of our departure to go home because I had stored all their toys. (Toddlers do not like watching "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View".) My four-year-old found a funny scene, but told me the rest was "too silly". This is a four year old, people. Anyone over the age of nine, for example, will want to kill their television rather than let it play itself. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is bad is to say that the Holocaust was a small mistake. There are no words to say how "ridiculous" this film is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically not funny. Since it's supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the film is just making things worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with a strange weird accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun to my knowledge), but all the characters are awful. I have not watched a real Laurel and Hardy movie for ages, but I KNOW they must be much better than that. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duet with ... that? <br /> <br /> In summary: a derived waste. Avoid at all costs unless you have scary fetishes of Bronson Pinchot. 2/10
