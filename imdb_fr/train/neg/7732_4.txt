Before writing this review, I went back and read the reviews of others. This film particularly disappointed me, as it stars two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, claiming a score of the often-marvelous Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "Thomas Crowne Affair" The dance was overheated, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs were easy to forget, the story was a joke, even the costumes were not particularly flattering, only the photographs captured the mood and the I am happy that others have appreciated "The Young Girls of Rochefort", although this is certainly not my case.
