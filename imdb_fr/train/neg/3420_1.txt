I saw this movie the first time around noon on Saturday night. This is really the perfect time for this one. I have NEVER seen a film so predictable and steeped in stereotypes. If you want to see a thrilling action movie, do not look at it, you might lose the will to live midway. However, if you want to laugh, look at it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection on a nice Saturday night. What struck me most was that each expensive scene was copied and pasted from a Discovery documentary or a former US Army TV show. In addition, I was amazed by the fact that they did not make the slightest effort to make the production real. If I remember correctly, Afghanistan is nowhere near the sea and yet with a simple click, Deke escapes from the sandcastle of terrorists with his jet-pack and is carried away by a submarine ( probably Discovery). Later in the film, Deke throws an Islamist terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene, you can admire the long hairs of the Korean stunt beating in the air when it is crushed against the wall. I must love him. I recommend watching it with friends and a good amount of beer, but then you will understand why I was crazy enough to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
