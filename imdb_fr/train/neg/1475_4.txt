Most episodes of Season 1 are awful. There is no comparison possible with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as their programs actually have a decent history. Most Amazing Stories are boring ... no wonder at all ... renting or buying the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard that Season 2 of this series was a lot better ... also for a reason anyway on the DVD they cut the parts of Ray Walston that further diminish this compilation. The best thing to do is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most scenarios are very predictable and the series could be better with twists that left you puzzled ...
