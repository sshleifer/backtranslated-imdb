Rarely seen since its theatrical release in 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become synonymous with cinematic debacles of legendary proportions. Now finally on DVD in an unexpected packaging, it is also unlikely that it wins a large audience today as it was during its first release. <br /> <br /> Gore Vidal's bestseller in 1968 was a dark and satirical statement. Most filmmakers felt that the story, structure and overall tone of the novel would not translate into film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights, but also engaged Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen. But studio executives quickly became cold-eyed: Vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice director-writer Michael Sarne was invited to present the film on screen. <br /> <br /> Studio executives hoped that Sarne would tap into the youth market Sarne was even more out of sync with the subject than the executives themselves. Rewrite after rewrite followed. The actors, feeling the disaster, became more and more combative. In her commentary on DVD, star Raquel Welch said she seldom heard of Myra's motives from one scene to another and even from one scene to the next, and that each person involved seemed to make a film totally different. In the accompanying Back Story documentary, Rex Reed reports that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is a film made by a group of people who have been hiding in their locker rooms waiting for their lawyers to respond. <br /> <br /> The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself. The basics of Vidal's story are there, but not only has history been rid of any broader involvement, it seems to have no meaning in itself. Everything happens in multiple directions, nothing connects and many scenes undermine the logic of the previous ones. And while the director Sarne has said several times in his commentary that he wanted to make the film a pure joke, the only laughter generated are accidental. <br /> <br /> The main of these accidents is Mae West. It is true that West's appearance is surprisingly well preserved and that she has lost none of her meaning with a one-liner - but we can not deny the fact that she is seventy years old and her belief that it is the still. the sexiest ride in shoe leather is disturbing to say the least. But the worst, really, is the fact that West is out of his time. His efforts to turn himself into a trendy and fulfilled character lead to one of the most embarrassing self-caricatures ever seen in a film. <br /> <br /> The remaining actors are largely lost. Raquel Welch, a largely underrated actress, plays the title role of Myra in the manner of a Barbie doll under steroids. the non-actor Rex Reed is incredibly effective in the role of Myron, but the role as a whole is essentially uninteresting. Only John Huston and players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper and Andy Devine are relatively unscathed. Yes, it's really the debacle that everyone involved in the film was afraid of: fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, pitilessly immodest from start to finish. It's true that director Sarne sometimes has the inspired idea - as in his use of movie clips from everyone, from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland, to create a counterpoint to the action - but basically, whenever Sarne sees himself presented with a choice of how to do something that he seems to have done wrong. <br /> <br /> The how and why of this are explained clearly in Sarne's audio commentary. Sarne did not like the novel or the subject in general. He did not want to write the script, but he needed the money. he did not want to direct the film, but he needed that money. He explains very clearly that he did not like author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he categorically states that Reed "is not a nice person"), and he considers to this day that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to be part of their "homosexual diary" - which, in the end, seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually films Vidal's novel rather than his own flight strangely imagined. <br /> <br /> Although he spends enough time commenting that the movie is very popular with the gay community, Sarne never really seems to understand that the film's appeal to a gay audience stems from its ridiculously inaccurate description of homosexual persons. . When accompanied by the film itself, Sarne is more than a bit homophobic - and frankly, the worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project. <br /> <br /> In addition to In the comments of Sarne and Welch and in the making-of documentary, the DVD includes several trailers and two versions of the film: a version "release" and a version "restored". The only difference between the two is that the final scene of the "restored" version was printed in black and white. The montages made before the general release of the film have not been restored, but the documentary specifies what they were. The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is pretty good. But to end where I started, it is indeed a movie that will interest most movie historians, moviegoers and moviegoers. I give it three out of five stars for their own sake, but everyone should miss it. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
