When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) looks into the death of her brother, she begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes". The closer she gets to the truth, the more she becomes a threat to her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line) and the rest of the local satanists. They will do all that is necessary to put an end to his habits. <br /> <br /> If you like satanic themed movies, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The film is filled with nudity and soft-core sex ritual. A particular scene involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world can save Black Candles. Most of the movie is a total boredom. Aside from the scene I mentioned before, the many sex scenes are not shocking and are certainly not sexy. The acting is at best uneven. Even the favorite kind, Helga Line, gives a disappointing performance. The plot does not really matter. Its main function seems to be to maintain the chain of matte sex scenes together. I only know another film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to her Dark Girls, which brilliantly combines eroticism and horror, Black Candles is an amateur. 3/10 is the best I can do.
