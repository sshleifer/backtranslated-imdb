I'm never a lot for classic movies. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane annoy me. However, I would much rather watch one of these films 3,469 times while being tied to a chair rather than watching An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite of all time. If I did that, I would probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> The direction of colors and music did not interest me, neither Gershwin nor non-Gershwin. Dance and singing could help an insomniac to fall asleep. The dialogue does not match Singin 'in the Rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie I fell asleep watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I only slept 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can not give zeros.)
