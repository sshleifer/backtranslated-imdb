In the words of Charles Dance's character in this movie, "Bollocks!" No conspiracy, no character development, and absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> Lots of things that do not happen in the real world (since when were British police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder cases?). Full of mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of dull and artificial dialogue. And the staging / editing is awful - mobile shots with a camera in hand that add nothing to the film, apart from a vague feeling of seasickness; confusing jumping cups; no structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snipes is totally unfriendly - why should we care what happens to him? Direct to the video? Direct to the trash!
