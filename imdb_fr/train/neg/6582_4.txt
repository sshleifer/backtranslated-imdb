Geez, another Lifetime movie, but again, it's not exactly the worst film in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it's quite obvious who is responsible for what, and that's usually pretty predictable. Even worse, some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing, and the viewer wondered, "Okay, how much do I care?" What I liked was that the movie will show you that it's never that simple: "the good are good and the bad are bad", and sometimes it's an evil against a rather bad than good against an evil. Hadley did not do what she did for the sake of justice, she did it because she felt entitled to work as a family and eliminate competition. As for Alicia, it just proves that a victim is not always a good person. Some of them "make him come", even if "it was" a painful and horrible death. "The Burning Bed" is a great example of this, but the difference is that the vile man in "The Burning Bed" got exactly what he deserved. But did Alicia "bring her in"? Some will say that it did, but others do not agree and the law in general either. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, it's a mix. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others have been indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or just not convincing. The music was pretty cool and some scenes are nice and warm, especially if you like action movies. The film is not bad shot at all, but given its glaring weaknesses, its strengths are unfortunately in the background. <br /> <br /> I heard about a sequel, but in the years, I doubt it. ' it will happen. But, I would not be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as evil, conniving, and horrible as they say, I do not think she'll say, "YAY, I'm coming out of a coma!" Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh, that's good! totally forgive him and want the charges to be dropped! "Hadley would have no trouble staying in prison anyway if she did it even though no murder had occurred. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's worth checking at least once!
