The plot does not offer new excitations, it even starts in the same way as the cube I. This time, there are no other improvements for the cube machine, except for one exit extra, unsupervised, very ingenious. The characters are not as well developed as in the first episode, they just became "flat" as in a soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone reaches the normal exit, they will ask questions such as "do you believe in God?", it is not really creative or original and especially in my opinion, it do not insert it into the mystery of the cube with its traps. Really, there is nothing else to say about it.
