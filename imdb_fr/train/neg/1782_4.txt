A charming boy and his mother settle in a city in the middle of the city nowhere. Cats and death are following them soon. That is just about everything. <br /> <br /> I recognize that I'm a little panicked by cats after watching this movie. But, despite the many problems with this movie, believe me, there is a lot to do, it's a very enjoyable viewing experience overall. <br /> <br /> The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basic instincts on which to rely. Fear, greed, lust or anger seem to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be said that this apparent failure, in fact, serves to tell the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is Stephen King's script (although I have nothing specific about Mr. King) is based quite well on some interesting FX work, makeup and rather appropriate music. The real jewel of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the mother of another world. <br /> <br /> King manages to take a simple story of outsiders or people a little different (okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists him in a campy on the a little horror jewel that must be in the collection of any horror fan.
