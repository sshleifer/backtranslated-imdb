Definitely not horrible, but certainly not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from Alan Paton's 1946 novel). With James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film deals with South Africa before apartheid and stories of a black man and a white man mingling. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones), a pious but naive preacher, receives a letter from Johannesburg asking him to come immediately; he later discovers that his son killed a man. Rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) discovers that his son, a black rights advocate, is the one who was killed by Kumalo's son. In this, they connect. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, because I did not see it. Or the 1974 musical Lost in the Stars because I did not see it either; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I saw; it sounds a lot more urgent, as if we were really trying to say something where the movie Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it's going. Very "Wishy-Washy". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I enjoyed the novel more than the film) because novels and movies are two extremely different media and it is useless to try to go directly from a movie to another or compare them. by the same means. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie was flipped. Well, I guess it was not that bad, - Five out of ten, - but it was not so good either. The two leading and highly skilled actors perform some of the most boisterous performances I've ever seen and some of the most difficult dialogues in film history (but this can be blamed on screenwriter Ronald Harwood, who is also a strange starter. film, having also written the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia). Among other things, the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to the film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any film moment, be it racial or suspenseful. The music does not help. The orchestra's painfully stray and boring orchestral tracks really help to calm the film. One of the advantages is the cinematography, with a lot of good or very good shots, but unfortunately, it does not help much the film. <br /> <br /> The last striking words of Alan Paton's novel are posted in the last moments of the film. It's a pity that they seem to be so disconnected from the film just shown. I do not know what Nelson Mandela could have seen in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
