You want a good recipe for failure? Take a plot, add a few weak characters and completely untapped and add the worst effects that a horror movie has known. Simmer for a week (the time probably spent doing this trash). The result is Corpse Grinders, a film that transports bad movies to dangerous and extremely exotic places. <br /> <br /> The movie blew completely. My words can not say how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can enjoy. This is not the plane 9 of outer space. It is a long time loss, boring and sad. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. I get depressed when I realize that people have really taken time out of their lives to play in this shit, if you can call it acting. But again, when you have a mediocre direction, a mediocre story, everyone is mediocre, playing is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a huge shit that you aspire to leave quickly from your existence. , fearing that a friend or loved one might see it somehow. In reality, I could destroy every copy of this film so as not to pollute the minds of budding filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me back respect for every film I've ever seen. You have shown me what is really horrible and why I should enjoy all those movies that are simply nil or boring.
