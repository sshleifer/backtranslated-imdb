Before I started watching the show, I heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a disappointment, the scripts are so dumb that I'm pretty sure the writers are Scoobidoo's son and grandson of writers. And what about the SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to look at them, the colors are not saturated, they are too saturated, as the scripts are overwritten and the display is overestimated. This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that since these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally emptiness and a total lack of credibility.
