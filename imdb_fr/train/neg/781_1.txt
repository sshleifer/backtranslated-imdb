This show was absolutely terrible. For a George is not funny, and his children are posh little kids. He also treats his mother with no respect. As a Hispanic, this series and the way the characters are described are very shocking. <br /> <br /> In addition, the dysfunctional family was put to death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this series fun when other series have already done it millions of times? I thought ABC would come back and take that trash out of the air, but unfortunately we'll have to bear it until they "jump the shark". <br /> In my opinion, they have already done it.
