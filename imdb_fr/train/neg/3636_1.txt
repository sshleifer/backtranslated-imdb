I am very open to foreign films and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this movie were boring. I have often thought of how interesting it would be to make a movie that simply shows a typical day or period that is useless. Now that I've seen a movie like this, I will not think about it that way. There are speeches about society, racism and some desires ... but South Park has it. And when I look at South Park, it really makes me feel an emotion. What I felt most moving during this film is the yawn I felt after the first five minutes. I notice the typical movie a seven or so because I like most movies. I gave this movie a.
