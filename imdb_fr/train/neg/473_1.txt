That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour. He could not help falling asleep. I said how bad it was and finally, I gave in and played it, running out of adjectives for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you want, the ultimate hack-work. Something so uninspired, so terribly horrible, that everything you want to do after seeing it is sitting alone in the dark and do not talk to anyone. Some people work in the illusion that this film is visible. It's not, not in any form of narcotics or brain damage. I would ONLY recommend this to someone to help them understand how unbearable it is. Do not believe me? Gather around. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a nation, we do not always represent the peoples of the Middle East in an elegant way. But what about a child in a sheikh's outfit who would greet a stack of Castrol engine oil bottles? You will find that here. FIND? OIL OF ARAB ARABES. I could not believe what I was seeing. The fact that the child flew planes in a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who in their mind would think it was a funny joke? It's not even close to "smart offensive". It sucks and it makes you want to hit someone who has been paid to write this piece in the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, a group of singers called "Landmines" takes place on the stage at an officer's ball. Ok, are you ready? The joke is that they sing TERRIBLY and OFF-KEY. Why did I write this in uppercase too? Because the joke is pound, pound, hammered into your head with a marathon of HORRENDOUS visual gags. They start rather mediocre; the glasses creak, the percussions are broken ... Then, there is, I'm serious at 100%, a sequence in stop-motion of two images of A WOMAN'S SHOES SHOES OFF. You read correctly, the music was so bad, in a frame, the feet of the woman have shoes. In the following, the shoes are off !!! Understand it, because the music was so bad that his shoes took off! What is the F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless montage of archive footage to make it clear that the song is bad. If a human being really suffered from this scene in the theater without running like a devil, I would be surprised. Honestly, this film is like a joke to see how fast people were locking doors. Robert Downey Sr. directs comedy as his son commands respect by staying drug-free. Wrong. Other things to watch for: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music played as much as possible. Whenever Liceman appears, a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song is played. In addition, all the actors do their best to make it very cold for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. The criminally terrible accent of Barbara Bach. Looks like she's trying to talk like a baby rolling a marble on her tongue. There is no nudity and there are several scenes where the boys moan and writhing after a glance at his cleavage, as if they were in a theater class at the community school and that they were ordered to act as retarded. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman gives his revolting dog a condom. Remember; when this movie was released by throwing "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "pissed off". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays an emachant and hungry boy pedophile at a time when Hollywood thought that "pedophile" and "homosexual" were one. Embarrassing flat-out. <br /> <br /> 5. Look at the end. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. It's actually the end. Tell me it does not make you want to explode everyone who has ever made a movie, ever. <br /> <br /> Look at this at your own risk. Up The Academy is famous for producing other movies, like The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less fun just by placing the videotape nearby.
