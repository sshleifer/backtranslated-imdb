I could not help but think behind the mask: the rise of Leslie Vernon (a massively more amazing film) when I watched her because of her realistic feeling and her great innovative idea. it could have been a BIG movie. the game is ... some of the actors well. others ... it's downright horrible. <br /> <br /> that aside the idea is great and the format is great. The story is very good too, even though it often suffers big shots in the logical mind. <br /> <br /> Too bad if it's not right? It's a horror movie after all. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this movie redone ... I really want it to be the fantastic movie he wants to be. <br /> <br /> However (and you can not really blame the minds behind the movie for that), this is obviously built on a shoe chain budget. and the fx really hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> excellent movie. ... if you had to exchange your effects for a better and slightly better fx. <br /> <br /> The one who wrote it should go on, but excellent.
