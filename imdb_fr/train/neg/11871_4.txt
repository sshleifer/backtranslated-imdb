Gregory Peck's game was excellent, as expected, and the cinematography was amazing, even when you played directly in a melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the movie was excessive and hard to watch, anyway for me. I was trying to like it, but I had to move quickly in the last thirty minutes or so. I feel that I have lost two good hours. Without Gregory Peck, I would not have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.
