I really wanted to love this movie a lot more than me. That's because I love crazy foreign comedies, especially the strange ones that completely surprise you. However, although this one takes me frequently by surprise, they are almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park because almost ALL social norms had been violated until the only people who remained talking were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug addiction (almost all types of products - marijuana, heroin, speed in search of sniffing), prostitution, suicide, murder, etc. . pedophilia. Mom encouraged her son (about 12 years old) to sleep with neighbors. In fact, at one point in the movie, she handed the boy over to the dentist instead of paying for dental care! Funny?! You're kidding. This film goes too far and plunges into the "black hole of comedy". What should they make fun of next, cancer or rectal tumors?
