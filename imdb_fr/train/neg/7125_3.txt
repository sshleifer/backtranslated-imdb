VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a big disappointment! And although Sam Peckinpah had a role in the screenplay, alongside Robert Towne, he still appears as a lavishly graphic film, curtly curated by the unedited Buzz Kulik. First, Yul Brynner said that Pancho Villa was wrong for the game! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His performance on a note lacks the fire and enthusiasm that Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat disguised as a Mexican bandit who finds himself in the midst of the Mexican revolution instead of Russia. In addition, the second bill Robert Mitchum is totally lost in the photo! His role as a flying biplane throwing homemade bombs into the air for the cause of the revolution is a poorly written role that could have been played by any minor star. Mitch does not have a decent line in the whole film and evokes his other image of the Mexican revolution, "Bandido" (1956), which is far superior to him, and that no one unfortunately seems to be interested in publishing on DVD. In addition to not having style, "Villa Rides" also suffers without the presence of a female star! The young Mexican star Grazia Buccella is a Mexican star who gives a happy look to Mitchum, but his casting is purely superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters might have added some essential notches to the sad story. <br /> <br /> There are some good action scenes in the film, but some good action scenes not a movie, the image quality Panavision mediocre, plus the theme too repetitive Maurice Jarre do not help things. <br /> <br /> As usual at Paramount, there are no extras - not even a trailer! Yup, a disappointing film and DVD presentation that could have been and should have been much better.
