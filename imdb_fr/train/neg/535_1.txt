Some of these viewers' comments are just ridiculous. Not painful to watch with your significant other? I apologized to my boyfriend all the movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly strange. <br /> <br /> The two Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were not fit to do it, especially with Vanessa making that impetuous and ridiculous American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same uncomfortable girl she was in My So Called Life. She must still push herself in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the few redeeming elements in this film. She stayed on the screen for five minutes and I swear to God that she took out the screen of the movie to slap me. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins have also been great in their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I mean, it was a well-shot movie, very pretty, the sets were dressed in an interesting way, relieving the intense boredom that I felt. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's really pathetic when a movie that claims a cast of "The greatest actresses of our time" is really bad. There were surely more than a few editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a huge fool. I was glad she was dead. But that's because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's friend - mainly because these two ladies were better actresses and made me feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Bad work, movie night. You were not entertaining and you did not even think about it. I hope the book was better, so it did not waste people any more time. 3/10
