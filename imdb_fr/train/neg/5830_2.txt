Drawing Restraint 9. Dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art movie? Are there only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork wears what looks like a giant hairy pita on his head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Maybe when mammoth pies and spines are used in a whale fat experiment. Or, when are you about to kill the composer for creating a minimal, and still boring, version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most pretentious films of modern art. At 135 minutes, he adds to his claim by being boring to boot. I would call the use of stunning colors and the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the film appeared to have been filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. That's until it seems like they're trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but that will come back later. <br /> <br /> In fact, the documentary-esquire parts were the best parts. The surface plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual of fattening the whales. Then there are guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcomed on the ship undergoing a ritual of humiliation that includes a shave of the lost head (think of frat boy pranks), patches with nicotine and giant pita hats with fur. Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism and let's not forget the giant peat bog. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney wrote that it was "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity". It's almost like you're saying, "If you do not get it, then you're not creative in your performance, so let yourself go because I'm an artist." Oh, wait, this is the post-modern interpretation of this sentence and what would the film be if it was post-modern. But, it's supposed to be modern art. What about the art itself? <br /> <br /> Let's start by interpreting everything we do, are we going? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be considered as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half-hour is about pearl divers and the construction of a gigantic ramp. Obviously, the ramp is the symbol of the need to raise oneself, no matter what standards you hold dear, and pearl divers seek pearls of wisdom. Then, on a whaling ship, they build a crate resembling the raw shape of a whale. Obviously, a crude element of prefiguration. <br /> <br /> On the ship, they make whale fat inside the whale's shape and take out the part of the fins. They replace this by a spine and later by a giant droppings. These are supposed to be the states of the movie itself. When it's fat, it's fun but bad for your health. When it comes to the spine, these are the "important" parts of the film, or the backbone as it were. Then, the giant droppings are the guts of the film, or when the film is shit. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney arrive on separate ships, are placed in strange humiliating outfits that are NEVER WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL, we suspect they ran out of money and Barney was trying to stop smoking. SO, they put patches on his head. They perform a ritual and discover the ship of a Japanese sage, who tells them that the ship is marked by another ship that struck him; an accident or an intersection, if you will. This makes Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, start cutting their legs and eating them so that they can turn into whales and become the same person. They cross each other. Oh, did I forget to mention that this was done in a video of Robbie Williams? Then the pearl divers return their mouth full of knowledge that they dropped to make a stupid Venn diagram. Barney managed to cross the 8th grade geometry, obviously. Or maybe at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and did I forget Bjork's score that hurts my ears? It's sometimes hypnotic, but at other times you just want to murder it. <br /> <br /> The art film is one thing, but when you throw up all kinds of symbolism in the hope of eliciting people's reaction, it becomes a self-destructive joke. When do you cross the border between becoming an artistic joke? Dali and Bunuel often did surreal foolishness, but were more consistent and / or more fun than garbage. An Andalusian Dog had the sensitivity to put as much symbolism as he could in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So, can I recommend this? Only if you like dull HIGH ART movies with lots of symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
