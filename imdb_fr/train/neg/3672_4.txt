I watched the entire film recognizing the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I am happy to have no idea of ​​Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the film, I said, "WAS Peter Weller?" Congratulations to Mr. Weller for an outstanding performance. Weller played a major character and his performance was such that I did not even recognize him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot was bad, the writing was bad and the performances other than those of Nosbusch and Weller, were below average. The scenery and setting were interesting, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 possible stars.
