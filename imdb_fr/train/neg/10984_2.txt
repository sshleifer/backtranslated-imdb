I watched this movie for two hours and I do not know what it is. Someone was murdered or maybe not and maybe someone did it or maybe not. This brought back memories of the good old days (bad old days?) Where all of CBC / Radio-Canada's Canadian films were ads. Lately, the stinkers have been the exception, but this confused hodgepodge of fashionable feminism, worrisome backsliding and murmured dialogues is making up for lost time. I have never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This film continues this beautiful Canadian tradition. It's not easy to watch. Perhaps the fashionable people in Chi-Chi cocktails in Toronto claim that they loved him. People in nonsense are a little less pretentious.
