First of all, I would like to add that I am a bit of a historian myself, so what I'm looking for in a film based on historical events is that it's actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here, however. Of course, the film is entertaining and anything but the fact that it is not entirely based on true facts is more than boring. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before the First World War. It was however during World War I and after that, he formed his point of view on the Jews. His education in this film is also inaccurate. Hitler, in his childhood, was not a disturbed kid. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that add to Hitler's puzzle. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is an excellent actor, but he does not really fit in with Hitler's role. Hitler was not so impossible and unstable as he is pictured here. In his youth, he was a charismatic figure who "manipulated" people through his charms. His unstable behavior and angry outbursts began at the turn of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life that is based on real historical facts and not on accusations. I really hate when people accuse Hitler and others, for example, and tell inaccurate stories for the sole purpose of portraying them as pure evil. It is better to tell the story EXACTLY as it was so that everyone could learn what it was like! Those behind this film should have done some research before doing so. Because it seems they do not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in Munch's revolutionary march, his shoulder was torn from his support. <br /> <br /> This gives you more to watch a good documentary than to see that.
