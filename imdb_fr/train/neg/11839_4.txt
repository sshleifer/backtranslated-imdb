"The Cat's Meow" contains some scenes boasting intelligent dialogues and great performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more efficient than I expected as a Chaplin (thanks in part to a great job as a hairdresser and makeup artist by a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing as novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (although the reason why movies never use her stuttering in real life is hard to explain). But these elements do not constitute a successful whole. The scriptwriter seems to have worked hard on some of the scenes - Davies and Chaplin's encounters are particularly well prepared - but not too much. Many minor characters do not need to be there and do not behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogicalness (for example, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really does not want to hear?), And the scenes of parties are repetitive and tedious. I would like to think that a trip on Hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie suggests. Davies is characterized as a standard type Flapper bubble, which is not really accurate, and the ideas of the writer on Chaplin and love are implausible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed so linked to the 1930s in "Paper Moon", lacks a similar affinity for the twenties. He insisted that the excellent costume designer only used black and cream, which gives the guests a very artificial appearance and only plays the most stereotypical songs of the time (for example, " Yes, we have no bananas "). When Hearst insists, everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" it seems that the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the shooting of the stage. <br /> <br /> The lives of silent movie stars can make fascinating films, I'm sure, but not this time.
