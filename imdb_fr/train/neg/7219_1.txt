I still have trouble understanding that such a bad movie can be shot in Hollywood. The acting and the story are simply pathetic and the direction is awful. I see no logic behind this trash, except maybe the director had nothing good to do. It took me ten minutes to understand that I had wasted my precious thirty rupees. I was dismayed to see that I was going to waste even more time in this shit. I bet the movie was done in less than a day. I do not know which category it belongs to. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, do anything, even bang your head against the walls, but do not go for this movie.
