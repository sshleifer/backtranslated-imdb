I was attracted by this movie because of the intrigue and my desire to watch a horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, it turned into a comedy rather than a horror. The acting, the dialogue and the unfolding of the film were all very poorly done. Much of that did not make sense. For example, there are about 30 people and they are all terrified by a person while they are in a secret place and are all young adults in good health and the guy who threatens them looks haggard. I kept thinking that maybe it was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look horrible - the emphasis is on trying it. <br /> <br /> Blood and blood are also poorly made. I saw Halloween costumes more believable than that. A guy with his head cut bare ... looked clean - missing signs: bones, flesh, blood and even the head. A strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should be lodged in something ... seemed to be the guy who was swinging a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Reveal who the main villain was supposed to be a twist, but contradicts other parts of the story. What was going on in the guy's mind to change like that? If there was to be a twist, you should at least add some mystery and suspense.
