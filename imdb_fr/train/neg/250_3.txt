Having seen three other versions of the same movie, I'm afraid it's by far the weakest, mostly because of Scott's rather dull and fiddled performance. His emotions are so insignificant that it is difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim describes the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at its lowest level, you do not understand that Scott speaks the dialogue with much conviction and when it undergoes its metamorphosis, it is equally unconvincing. I do not see any actor in this film that corresponds to that of the version of Alistair Sim. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take it better to be performed. Very disappointing.
