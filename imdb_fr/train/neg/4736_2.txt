The film deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl (I'm sorry, I'm biased, I think a pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies) and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1. I I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seats. I was surprised to be able to sit across. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the highlights of the film. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. That's all there is to save the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was a man, I'm sure most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about the negatives. First of all, it's really slippery, with a lot of repeated scenes. The scenes of Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It's more like a dramatic way of turning. Typical Japanese dramas like flashbacks, and this movie too. Secondly, the film is too unrealistic in a historical context. I do not have the spirit of unrealistic films. But this film is like a mediocre way to show off its creativity, throwing ninjas that act like bears and cobwebs, etc. It reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a fantastic movie. In addition, to represent "I do not know" what effect the director is filming all around people who are dying of bleeding blood ... those who do not realize that their head has been cut, etc. etc. etc ... etc ... Too much of them ruin the show. It seems that the influence of the anime is strong in this film. This greatly degrades the show. Third, is not Azumi supposed to be an assassin? For me, she looks more like an army of one man, but the fact that she is a woman. I do not think you see murderers charging in army camps. The only time I felt she acted "like an assassin" is when she killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. It is a linear plot without development and surprises in any way.
