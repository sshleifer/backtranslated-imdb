Considering that the original version of the movie "The Haunting" is one of my top ten movies of all time, "I approached this adaptation with concern.I was right to be careful because this movie is a load of old toss poorly written and poorly executed, people involved should be ashamed, the original was terrifying for me as a child for a reason, you do not see anything, Robert Wise used innovative photographic work and superb lighting to generate fear and that's why it works.The shame of the new version is that it takes smart special effects and pyrotechnics to go from A to B, but it is even sadder to see that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different, this film should only be seen as an example of a studio butchery!
