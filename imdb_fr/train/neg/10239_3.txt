Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire movie that offers little value. Completely devoid of eroticism, enthusiasm or feminine seduction. A decent fight, a few moments of slight suspense. And a plot of a note. <br /> <br /> The film is ironic as a philosophy in a series of interviews between the character of Law and a detective persecuted in the homicide, well interpreted by Timothy Spall. Despite all their efforts, the two actors are closely linked to the banality of the film. <br /> <br /> With a smaller actor in the leading role - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis' cinematography - crocodiles would merge into the sea of ​​low-budget vampire quickies.
