I saw the 10am showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the cinema to claim my time (since I no longer pay for the films), I did not find any quality that redeems. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and such that I'm kidding, but the movie mostly seems to be composed of a wide range of fans to the male audience (more in mind that this movie is rated R). The fan service seemed out of place and rather embarrassing. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous phrase, but let's be honest, it's a lot of hype that pays very little. The only really horrible part of the movie was the CG, which looked very digitized and did not fit well with live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm a reasonable man, I knew how to go to the theater. that I was not going to see "Casablanka" and I am at least grateful that this film is an original idea (albiet inane) and not a retouching or retouching franchise. However, to be honest, if you are not part of the cult, you would probably do better to spend your money elsewhere and see the movie in a second theater in a few weeks, or rent in a few months.
