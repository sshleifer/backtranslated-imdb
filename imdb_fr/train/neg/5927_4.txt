I'm a very politically correct guy, so when I talk about sex, I really mean that it reduced the number of female guests, Dr. Miranda Jones, played by Diana Muldar. In spite of all his supposed genius and self-control, there was nothing left inside but a big, unreasonable, jealous baby. Ambassador Kollos, out of jealous fury, but preview first. (You think he could have entered the room with his eyes closed and put the box in phase, too easily) He takes the Enterprise into a non-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys can control it . Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at that time they could have gone to see the good doctor-liaison lady and discuss it. "Spock has to blend in with Medusan's spirit so we can go home - I mean, like the beech, do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die?" But the real-life Star Trek lady is a jealous monster who moans and moans when the idea is approached, even when her idol of Medusan told her to shut up and accompany them. Thus, undressing with Spock, who is related to him, makes him forget to put on his visor, which makes Spock crazy. Of course, Kirk realized how fucking she was and made her ashamed to repair Spock with his superior telepathic powers. Of course, in the end, Lady and Medusan leave and everything is forgiven. You almost want the president of Battle Star Galactica to come and throw the witch into an airlock for her destructive waterfall. But in Star Trek, women are allowed to be totally unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time, there is supposedly sexual equality. That's what I mean by sexist.
