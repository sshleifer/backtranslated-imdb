This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. From the beginning, I knew it would be a crash. It starts with an apparently mean girl who kills a group of nuns during a mission. It turns out that its inhabitants were possessed by random zombies. Well, a few years later, college students are making a joke. A horrible acting game goes from pledge to jock header. Things like the young boy shouting at him to do things in a way completely different from that of chal- liness, with a commitment to react and do too much "an eager role to be popular". Absolutely horrible special effects with guns. For example, guns making a noise without muzzle flash, and vice versa. this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (their movement in stop motion is a mystery), nerdy music and about 40 weapons coming out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a shit. Like many others, you can rent 50 cents at the nearest place to rent a movie.
