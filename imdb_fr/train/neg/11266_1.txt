Well, what can I say ... <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie, I still wonder what's the point? A dubious camera moves in the yard at some point ... I had to look away from the screen, I felt physically sick ... All in a circle ... You have an idea ... <br /> <br /> Very VERY very strange accents in many ways .... "Those who should know, know" <br /> <br /> Unless you enter for free, or get paid to watch it, or if your partner is about to get you painted the house or something .. so forget that ...
