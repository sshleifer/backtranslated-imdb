A missed train. A bad phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make an apparently innocuous decision? Most people do not care because they are absorbed by their own thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "An event" tells the story of interrelationships and cause-and-effect relationships between the mundane and the normal Parisian folk group. It contains all the components of what is happening for contemporary theater, with the complete distribution of dysfunctional and disillusioned. <br /> <br /> a boring girlfriend, a selfish roommate and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou plays the role of protagonist (in the sense that she is in front of the camera as much as anyone and opens and closes the film) and a normal girl who can not seem to find the right rhythm in his life. <br /> She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger in a train what her horoscope holds for her. What happens to him during the day is told through various characters. Does the prediction come true? The concept is good, but the story is fragile. Connections from one event to another are weak. The Liberty Mutual story is better in 15 seconds: one person sees a good action and passes it on to another than it does in two hours with Happenstance. <br /> <br /> If you like Audrey Tautou, you can certainly sacrifice the time devoted to this film, but you will end it with dissatisfaction and you will wonder what could be the same scenario if it was managed by a better producer and director.
