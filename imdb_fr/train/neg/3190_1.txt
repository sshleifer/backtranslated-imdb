Jimmy Dean could not have been more hammered or ridiculously absurd. Hysterical if seen through the eyes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I call 10. I mean, the sight of this obese maize-fed trouncing pig around Malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory, if you do it far into the film. This ugly hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh". A film like this proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc., fall behind their mortgage or are stoned to the point of becoming insane. This begs the question "who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" But then, if good judgment had prevailed and "Final Justice" had never been, we would not have the charming voiceover parody in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
