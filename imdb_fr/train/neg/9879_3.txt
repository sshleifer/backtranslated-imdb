After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "The Fantastic Mr. Fox" is an adaptation of the classic of a beloved child, depicting the story of the protagonist, Mr. Fox (or "Foxy") while he try a "last" flight to steal the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. That's right, shorts, fat, lean, or whatever, that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start with my reviews. <br /> <br /> Well, I 've never been a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material enough, having read some of his books when he was a child and saw Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory again and again. This film, however, fights for an audience. Is it for children? Adults? I am still uncertain! Many "jokes" would bother a child, especially when Mr. Fox visits a lawyer, for example, or complains about being poor. In addition, it is expected that an audience of children (I guess) sympathize with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you almost see that Mr. Fox is biting his neck! It is surely a little too much? And then, the plot ... well, it's a bit boring. I only stayed in the hope that it would improve, but instead, I got more and more annoyed with Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the humor falls flat. I laughed only once or twice, even though I specifically recognized joking attempts. I think in part that the dubbing is incredibly flat and monotonous. The actors of the voice have no sense of comic timing, but rather a subtlety of humor that only works on certain mediums. George Clooney wants to portray Mr. Fox as charming and elegant, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I did not even realize that Bill Murray had a role until the end credits. Ash, 12 in the fox, sounds like he's about 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I like animation a lot, especially in stop motion, but the visual style scared me a little. The characters are tall, thin and devoid of any warmth of design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is choppy and strange. There is also a distinct "mixed media" sensation, as 2D components are sporadically and unsuccessfully added. The characters look at the camera and talk. it was very embarrassing. There was a moment or two when Kylie looked directly at the camera, did not move and had swirls on her eyes. It really scared me. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Many people still seem to like - look at the reviews. Maybe it just was not for me.
