First - there is absolutely no flirtation in this movie - with Anthony or whoever else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first test of endurance is to go through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. It would not be so bad - damn it, I love violence and perversion as much as the next critic, but without context, it's repulsive. So you resist torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the film turns into something different, not better, but quite different: a heartless road picture. There are bad comedy attempts with cameos - widely written and performed by bands like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (as well as some prostitutes and drag queens). They all deserve better. Photography is deliberately disorienting, so if you have motion sickness (or really ALL kinds of diseases), this movie is not for you. If you think about it, I do not know who this movie is for, with the possible exception of gay and bisexual S & M fans who like badly shot and badly shot movies.
