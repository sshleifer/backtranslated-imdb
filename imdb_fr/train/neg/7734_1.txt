This film is the worst film I have ever seen. The scenario is weak - I could not even follow it. The acting game is high school student. The soundtrack is irritating. Humor attempts are not. The editing is horrible. The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film. Do not waste your time, even thinking about this attempt to act.
