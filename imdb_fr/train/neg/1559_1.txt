This is perhaps the worst film I will see if I live to 100 years. I think a group of first year students could have offered better intrigues as a class project. I am stupid to have looked at it, and may God have mercy on the souls who have been paid to produce this film. <br /> <br /> And after finally turning it off, I really wanted to throw up. <Br /> <br /> Nobody had the slightest idea of ​​photography. Nobody had the slightest idea of ​​acting. Nobody knew almost nothing. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that F / X shows that shit on occasion. The only time I saw it was on one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was about 3 o'clock in the morning.
