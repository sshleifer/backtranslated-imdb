This film had all the elements to be an intelligent and bubbly comedy, but for some reason, it took the path of the idiot. Maybe he did not really know who his audience was: this movie is far from being a men's movie given the cast and plot, but he's still too bright and stupid blonde to please women . <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Legally Blonde and her sequel, then it looks like the staggering and awful sequel. Big players such as Luke Wilson should expect better equipment. Jessica Simpson could also have handled a lot more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in silly but amusing secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Many things in this movie were painted by numbers, the various hyper-clich√©s montages, the last minute "misunderstanding" ", even the children's party chaos.This simply suggests a lazy script writing <br /> <br /> It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you do not take it seriously, but it is so beautiful that you could feel better frustrated and frustrated.And more and more disappointed as the scenes are scrolling.
