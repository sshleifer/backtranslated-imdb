I chose this title from a friend who had it in his extensive collection of DVD / Video / Laser Disc. Fortunately, I personally did not have to pay for it. I thought it would be a bad movie, but I know what a really bad movie is after watching movies like Children should not play with dead things and incredibly strange creatures that have ceased to live and have become zombies mingled, and now. There is really nothing that makes me dizzy unless it's incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis is bad, but it does not reach the point of absolute pain where some films are. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare to Earth that will essentially destroy it. In order to counter this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a spacecraft and crew to fire an antimatter bomb (which the opening describes as "the greatest explosive of all time") in the sun, which has passed through complicated sci-fi scenes. logic will bring forth the flare from a different angle, leaving the Earth unharmed. <br /> <br /> Drop what I just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with overall training (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can barely manage this level of mediocrity, thanks to a scenario that just begins, but becomes more and more absurd as the time spent. <br /> <br /> The final success of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villainous character (played by Boyle) who wants to sabotage the mission. By means that are never explained, he sends a wicked minion with an embarrassing haircut to exercise some kind of vague electronic intelligence on the genetically modified space scientist, interpreted by Annabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging the mission? Because, from his point of view, he believes that the flare will not happen and that, if he does not, he will become fabulously rich because he put his evil claws in the stock market. In fact, you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film becomes surprisingly complicated and develops very slowly, with time to appeal to characters with vague or unnecessarily brief roles in the scenario. I could sit here and explain in detail what is going on to demonstrate the screenwriter's great inability to make a conspiracy that clicks or catches your attention, but I sit here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know for a fact that this would take three pages, and I would only succeed in losing your interest. But again, you will probably get the same effect by watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, the film is miserably removed in an extremely mediocre dialogue. Imagine that if everything that happened in Star Trek Enterprise happened, it was because the characters were spitting science fiction jargon between them. Yes, I know, they're doing it already, but imagine if it's EVERYTHING they've done and they used that jargon to create vague and almost absurd scenes that produce no excitement, tension, or interest in the spectator. <BR /> <br /> This is best illustrated when a character in a Zero-G environment screws a bolt onto a metal box before crying in pain for a few minutes before suddenly exploding. The script alludes to the character who is in danger of an explosion, but does not bother to give a concrete answer as to why or how it happens, or why he can not really escape. All in all, you have a sad cross between the weird and the laughable. <br /> <br /> Then we have several scenes where a dramatic accumulation leads to nothing. The performance of Jack Palance is wasted on a character who only drives the hero (do not ask the question) in the desert, before being shoved and being killed by a lot of costumes. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells our boy hero his last name (while he was wearing a horrible and bruised makeup that looked like someone had put a balloon under his eye), which he had kept silent before. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy gently repeats it after its expiration, giving viewers the impression that the name has some meaning later in the film. Perhaps Charlton Heston's grizzled admiral knows him and the plot will progress as soon as his name is repeated. Something. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Nope. Sorry. All the hopes that you have will be wiped out when this moment turns out to be just one of the many unsuccessful and disordered attempts to create a drama for such a flat and ridiculous character that it will forever remain a stain on Palance's career. , just like those of the film. The rest of the cast is also marked. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is a painfully abrupt end featuring Schofield flying the bomb in the center of the sun in order to redeem his exploits under the spell of the villain, a climax. which features another sequence of extremely well-made visual effects of the film which, even for the visibly elaborate care that is put on it, still manages to give the film an appearance as chintzy as it really is. The saddest part of this film is its obviously considerable budget, tragically wasted by a scenario and a secondary distribution behind Boyle, Heston and Palance, who manage to close the coffin with a pure overbid. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
