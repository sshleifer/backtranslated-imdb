Oh, what a bad, very bad movie! Co-written by and featuring Sylvester Stallone - that should have been enough - and featuring too many climbing scenes, dizziness, villains and villains, as well as a failed airborne hold-up. There are two parcels, both lame. One involves an unsuccessful traumatic rescue, and the other involves malicious people destroying an aircraft for loot and killing various innocent people as far as possible. John Lithgow, who is usually reliable, perhaps depressed by the horrible nature of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he does not care about "Bostid!" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was playful and enigmatic when she played Maggie in Northern Exposure, is sadly lost in the role of a mountaineer and rescue pilot. Stallone is stiff and muscular. No dead lines in this one. No life line, either.
