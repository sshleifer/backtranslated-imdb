One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obliged to express his joy for the less attractive films of the MTC library, as this would explain why he is touting the "virtues" of this "charming" film when it was introduced when I saw it on cable TV. Since any old movie on IMDb gets the "classic" status of a number of amateur critics, I thought it was urgent to make a more honest critique of this film. <br /> <br /> This is not your father's "Shop around the corner." Despite all my scruples with "You have a mail", it surpasses all this as a remake of almost every imaginable way For those who have seen the original, the flaws will only be more obvious. <br /> <br /> According to one of the most gloomy sequences of Meet Cute, I remember having it view (a sad attempt at "humor"), this film starts on the wrong foot and never really goes back.This "musical" can only be qualified in the clearest sense of the term. instantly forgetful musical numbers and then there is Judy who sings "I Do not Care" while waving her arms as if she were in crisis.The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her best numbers here Miss Garland has been wonderful in many musical films, but here she looks horribly wrong. Originally this role and Judy is permanently unable to replace the old role of Margaret Sullavan. Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second-rate type Jimmy Stewart. The main roles never reach the chemistry of Stewart / Sullavan or even that of Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that knows (some) the notes, but not the music. He does not really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest to the character of Van Johnson to complicate things unnecessarily. The replacement of the remake at the infidelity sub-plot of the original is a used parcel device including a priceless violin. It's almost embarrassing to watch and you get the impression it may have been lifted from an episode of Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean condenser and a stream. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton prateat. Even the high-resolution scene between the romantic tracks is poorly managed. After seeing both movies, you'll understand why they called it "the Lubitsch Touch" and NOT the "Robert Z. Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid this and look back at the original movie or Judy Garland's previous films, unless you're an iconoclast who likes to see a real, once-beautiful star fall.
