The plot tells the story of a nurse, Anna, who is caught in global chaos as carnivorous zombies begin to emerge, invading the world and attacking the living. She escapes into the streets and is saved by a black policeman. So far, so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this movie does not deserve to be called horror. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. Even "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a group of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to enter a mall with more alcohol. Heroes who have locked themselves inside the mall to avoid being eaten by thugs outside are no better either. Even if they do not seem drunk, they give the impression of being mentally handicapped. Save your money instead of spending it!
