As long as you can suffer! If you like to watch people wake up, get up, get dressed, take a shower, prepare dinner, look at each other, make love in the dark, then go back to bed to sleep ... if you like sticky apartments, the narrow rooms and kitchens, long minutes of silence ... if you like to get bored for two hours and feel the thrill of "real fake art", then you will love it. But if you do not, try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you are here", but do we want to stay? This German film received the Turin Gay Film Festival Award: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, as the festival featured many talented films. Maybe be nice to a German because they are not often rewarded? Well, "The life of others" did it ... but this one is excellent but not gay. So maybe it's a fashion issue. Are the Germans "again"? No matter what? Or maybe only for a hustler look of some directors?
