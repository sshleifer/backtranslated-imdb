Debbie Reynolds plays with brushes, tangos and, yes, tap dancing through this ordinary thriller that exudes a distinctively 1930s atmosphere. Two ladies, reunited when their sons commit murder, are trying to start their lives running a tap school in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is plagued by neuroses. Can you imagine that 10 years ago with Robert Aldrich at the head of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never have left so much time on the screen to Joan strutting, and I can not imagine Bette Davis in the other role, dancing to the throat. This is a purely fanciful piece of macabre, written by Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to stage the mass murder of a group of rabbits!). Not an ounce of honest pleasure in the whole tepid package. * 1/2 of ****
