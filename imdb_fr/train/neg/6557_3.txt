Really, they spelled it BRAIN in the credits, not BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they did not have the budget for a spell checker. All the money from production went to big old cars. There are at least two Packards visible here. One is a Darin Convertible. A nice yellow convertible Packard. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the movie studio show that money has been spent on costumes and sets. Old cameras, a Ciro exterior, road signs and all that was needed to create a pleasant image was there. Badly written and realized. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it takes about 104 minutes. It was more like 85 minutes. It ended without reaching a conclusion. There was a collision but no conclusion. The film has just crushed the credits. 99 cents for that. I paid 99 cents for that. I could have bought 3 boxes of cat food and watched the face of my excited cat more moved. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds in Ciro's scene after Darren McGavin's call, it might sound like. .. this film would have a surprise turn that would make an interesting film. The young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have played a much bigger role in everything that was happening here. This cast could have made a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut Brian's role and use Steven Bauer in his place, they change the script and keep the Packards and lose the band and add a similar sound to Johnny Otis. group, then they had something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
