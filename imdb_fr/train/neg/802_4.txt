Like so many media experiences, this amateur effort contains the seeds of a very interesting social commentary. For more than 5 years since its release, events in the world of software development have made the principle less scandalous, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I guess ... of Hitchcock, and he It's a shame that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it's almost a parody of pulp fiction, including the screaming soundtrack when we're supposed to be careful. Exclamation points and uppercase letters can almost be seen on a yellowed page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I found it quite amusing for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the tablecloth has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yes - and even though the seams were shown and it cracked a lot, my heart rate increased, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
