this film is not good.The first was almost nil, but he had this unreal end that made him interesting to watch. He has nothing to do. There is no fear, no tension or suspense. This is not really a horror movie. Most murderers do not show anything. There is nothing to talk about. It could almost be a television, except a little nudity and a bit of violence. The staging is not very good, either. And do not get me started on the dialogue. As for the surprise ending, surprise, there is not one. I guess it could have been worse, although I do not see how. but again, it lasts less than 80 minutes, so I guess it's a good thing.though it seemed a lot longer. apparently it's the cut version of the movie.I found it for a very cheap price, but it's still not worth it.If you want the fuller graphic version, check out the Anchor edition Bay.In any case, this version of Sleepaway Camp II: The unfortunate campers get a big 1/10 of my share. As you watch this movie, you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper. If you are a real fan, you may want to purchase the Anchor Bay Sleepaway Camp (with its survival kit), a collection of three discs containing the first three uncut films and with special features
