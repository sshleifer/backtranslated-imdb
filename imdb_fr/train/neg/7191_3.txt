I saw it last night at the Midnight Slam of the Montreal World Film Festival. What a desappointment. This movie is clearly overestimated by IMDb fans. The acting game was only regular. The staging brought nothing new or interesting. The plot is missing a lot: the film only deals with these graduates and the game they play by making jokes (7eventy 5ive). And on top of that, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like jokes and a slasher with an ax that makes you jump once or twice throughout the movie, you might like it. If you do not do it, this movie is not worth it.
