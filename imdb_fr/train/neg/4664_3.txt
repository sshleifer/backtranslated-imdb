I voted 3 for this film because it looks great, just like all the Greenaways releases. However, it was his usual mix of "artistic" sex and pretentious bullshit. I know a lot of people like this movie, but I got tired very quickly. This is definitely not for everyone. The ubiquitous McGregor obviously took the role for credibility reasons, I suppose, but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate to send someone to the corner of pseud but please ..... !!! On the positive side, it's visually very appealing and I enjoyed the music but I could not see it until the end and I can not say as much for many movies. I usually watch everything but it's unbearable !!
