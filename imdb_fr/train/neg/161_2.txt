If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a pimp on New York Street or John Wayne as a Communist spy, then you might believe that Pat Boone is a juvenile offender on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you might enjoy this movie . <br /> This movie is so stupid that it's not even alluring for a sexless love affair from the mid-1950s. And the problem is that Hollywood has made it so Big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman who was not his wife before he was released. The public knows he will not kiss Shirley Jones. You can not anticipate the "screen consumption" of their love. It's a bit like watching a western in which cowboys do not have guns. <br /> <br /> The story is irrelevant. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love belongs to the worst bargain baskets with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
