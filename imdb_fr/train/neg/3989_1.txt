Who, in his mind, plays a lyrical song at the same time as he describes an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his injured wife in the locker room, the song sung with lyrical content is as strong as the dialogue. So we can not hear anything, which mitigates any emotional impact of the scene. The scenes in which Annabella was beaten by her father with her fists, a lamp and a belt were so caricatural that they were absurd. All this film is a cartoon, the general prejudice against the whites is literally astounding. The discussion of the black women after Flipper's wife shows that he cheated on her with a white woman - as if it was a discussion led by a team of debates at Oxford, it's ridiculous. Rampant racism may be possible, but the soundtrack and the sound mix during this "movie" are too important. It was a technically bad movie. There is no understanding of the core business of filmmaking, soundtracking, editing, and the desperate attempt of big players trying to keep the movie afloat. In fact, I felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he had accepted a role in this film - his appearance in this film is painful. This is the first film I saw by this director and it will be my last.
