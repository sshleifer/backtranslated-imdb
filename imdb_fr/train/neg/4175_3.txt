I think Micheal Ironsides' acting career needs to be over, if he has to play in that kind of low-budget bullshit. He could surely do better than waste his time in this garbage. <br /> <br /> This film could be much better if it had a good budget, but it appears several times throughout the film. There is a scene in an outpost, which looks like, it's in front of the station, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that gave this film a 3, and it shows the spaceships landing and taking off over a lake surrounded by forests. It's done well, but forget the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is another scene, which looks like a manufacturing plant, I bet, and that does not look like an outpost The character says that's the case. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, has a limited budget, makes no sense and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
