... but it just does not work and I'm surprised how many people see it as good. On what grounds? There are some loose hints here and there, but all the material is complacent and unconvincing. Lynch's films are usually intriguing because they create a sense of confusion and yet are very playful in this regard. There is a visual sense, there are secondary intrigues, characters, ideas, and so on. But it's boring and yes, useless. Because all there is to explore is either "small", or too wacky, or simply said before in a superior way. It's just Lynch exploring DV, nothing more, so it should be treated like that. 1/10
