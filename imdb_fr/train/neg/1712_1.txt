If Todd Sheets were to admit that this movie was intended to usurp the zombie genre, I would change my note to eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, every line and even every nuance of actor was designed to be a parody. I could probably break the mouth of the alphabet, rearrange what was left of letters and still have a better script. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this film. SPOIL ALERT! One is when Mike's father and the other father walk, I repeat, go down a staircase packed with zombies. It is a small staircase and, even if they brush against the undead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the ex-navy turns around, says "God, you're a horny bastard", and only draws one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera rotates around her for about forty seconds, while she is surrounded by zombies at arm's length. She then rushes almost by chance into the crowd and joins the other humans. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Nevertheless, I enjoy this film as much as almost all comedies just because it's so funny. Congratulations to Todd Sheets for putting so many people into his film and wanting to do it, but not really for anything else.
