There are no words to explain how NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is bad. It just defies the description. Something about a computer that can turn personal items into silver balls that enter the victims' mouths, killing them or turning them into zombies. Everything is so stupid that it's beautiful. There is also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer speaks via a puppet !!!!!!!! I do not invent anything. The computer also controls things like cars, even if there is no connection between the computer and the vehicle. <br /> <br /> The "film" is pure waste. Bad surreal basket. Spectacular, unique bad trash. There are many sex scenes thrown here and there, which are neither very hot nor erotic. There is even a scene where a woman apparently makes love or wants to fuck a French tarantula, which made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the worst films ever made. Up there, BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II, is just as miserable. We also feature scenes from NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II. At least, it's fun to watch it and try to understand what's going on.
