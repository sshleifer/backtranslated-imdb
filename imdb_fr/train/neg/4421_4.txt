The subject is certainly convincing: a group of people goes even further by creating a false medieval world populated by warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that plunges into our collective need to "escape" from reality and sometimes into the banality of our existence - something that almost everyone can relate to. The characters are the predictable mix of Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek buffs. It's enough to get most people to watch. However, very quickly, the film is transformed into insider vision of the wargame with an almost stereotypical thumb finger to the viewers who "did not understand it". The filmmakers seem to take the subject of the wargame, and this one, waaaaay too much instead of recognizing from time to time the humor and the pleasure of making a film about adults dressed in medieval clothes and fighting with foam swords. It is very difficult for anyone who does not sit on their computer for 7 to 10 hours a day to play games or design the last featured destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care about them. However, the filmmakers themselves seem not to care about choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that everyone can understand. In addition, the characters themselves are not so convincing and you get bored quickly: a big no-no when you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
