I watched this film on March 21st of this year. I must say that I am disappointed.But much better than "Tridev" .The plot is ridiculed. It tells the story of Prabhat who lives with his father, his wife and his little brother.The film opens when he saves a wife. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his younger brother.He makes a plan by sending few men.They come to a school claiming to be friends of Prabhats.Take this kid.His father throws him out from the house.Then, he comes back.Sonny gives a good performance, Chunky was at best annoying, Naseerdun is lost .ivya did well, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted but she was cute. The child who played Sunnys's brother in the movie was cute. Too sad, he had to kill his character. The girl was cute but boring. The other child was doing good.Alok was doing good.Kiran was enough.Amrish and Gulshan were good.The cinematography is excellent in India and Kenya.Script is weak but has some good dialogues. In addition, the film is dragged. The music was correct.I loved only one song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics of this song were good.The other songs were forgotten.Do not look at that. Note-3/10
