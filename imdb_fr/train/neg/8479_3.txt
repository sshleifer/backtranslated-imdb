Okay, when I came on the board for this film, I was really expecting people to make fun of it. I was surprised to see that people over 7 years loved it. I enjoyed the movie ... but only me and my little sister (who is only 10 years old actually) made fun of everything. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Jordan, but that role was terrible. You know that a movie goes to the bathroom when the first role can not act. And he did not even have a good scenario or plot to buy him back. I also thought that Pamela's character was very lame ... at the pathetic limit. <br /> <br /> Even with that said, I thought there were some good actors, like the gorgeous Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Nevertheless, not enough to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie that I just can not forget: <br /> <br /> 1.) That guy Spencer would fall in love with her. Ok, eww. I looked at the dates and although in reality he is only four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed much bigger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF, she looked like she was 10 or 12 years old ... she looked like a little kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed to be a university student. <br /> <br /> 2.) There is no way that Kristi Yamaguchi can come just to skate for a girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it still seemed unlikely that Kristi would go to a boarding school without a skating scholarship, or that a school would have employed a skating coach with such relationships. . <br /> <br /> That said, it was not the worst movie of all time, but it was not very good, even by DCOM standards, which I consider rather mediocre.
