Okay, at first this movie looked pretty good even though it was moving fast enough and even though they only had a $ 60,000 budget, that was fine, but if you found your dead sister in a Lake and find out who would have killed her, why would you chase him around and shoot a gun on him with one bullet and waste him and eventually run from him all delayed and get himself killed? More after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and found out who was the killer, why would not you give this clue to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the film, when she acts as her sister who was a waitress and she talks to the bad guy, she should meet him somewhere and record him saying that she was dead and what had happened to him "evidence". I do not know that I was not happy with the end. This film could have been so much better if it had lasted longer and the acting was better and the end was not so bad! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do, you will write a review here too and you will not be happy.
