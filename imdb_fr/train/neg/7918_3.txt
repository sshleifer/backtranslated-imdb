I found the writing of this film absolutely horrendous. <br /> <br /> The performance of Lacy Chabert was the only thing that saved me the ranking of this film. I think he interpreted the multiple personalities very well. For me, she was undoubtedly the highlight of this film. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was pretty as always, but I found her role rather bland, so I do not think we can say that she was great. > <br /> As for the male chef, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role made me think mostly of the serial doctors of the cheese hospitals of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> All this with which I could live. However, the end / terrible, terrible, terrible solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of the psychic are just some of the worst writings I have seen for a long time.
