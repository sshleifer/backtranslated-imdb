In the future of 1985, a government committee led by Howard Hesseman holds hearings on the first uncensored network of television. They sample his programming, which comes in the form of a series of sketches. I can name good sketch movies with one hand without using my thumb. "Amazonian Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mike's Mondo Video". Notice how I did not mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason is that this "film" is death in cinematographic form. None of the sketches are even funny, nor even the least intelligent. Film directors need a lot of ineptitude to not even laugh. <br /> <br /> My note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn is front-filler
