The Zombie Revolt is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty far off the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the zombie trick after the First World War, one of the members decides to use knowledge for their own evil ambitions. And he succeeds, at least in the beginning. A love triangle complicates the story. <br /> <br /> It was really a tedious movie, with a horror game that made it hard to tell who were zombies and who were not. The dialogue was a little better and the plot was amazing (not the zombie party but parties related to the "romance"). And while I'm neither a student nor an expert in cinematography, the camera work did not seem to help much. <br /> <br /> Even though I've seen some worse movies, it's unlikely to please anyone. It's bad, and NOT so bad.
