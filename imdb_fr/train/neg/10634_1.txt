Screenwriter / director Bart Sibrel bases his work here on a movie box he claims to have been mistakenly sent by NASA. He says he shows astronauts simulating TV images of their trip to the moon using camera techniques. The astronauts were always in low Earth orbit and the ground editors composed this raw sequence in a few seconds of finished film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so cowardly that he does not realize his The behind-the-scenes footage comes largely from the 30-minute live TV broadcast (also on this reel) that has been seen by millions of people and not hidden in NASA's vaults, as he points out. And we have to wonder why Sibrel inserts his own conspiratorial narration into astronaut audio, because hearing astronauts in their own words makes it clear that astronauts were simply testing the camera, and not simulating a sequence. <br /> <Well, anyone can see the raw footage without having to buy the pirated version of Sibrel. (He shows you more about Zapruder's movie about JFK's assassination than his "smoking gun.") Sibrel thinks he's the only one to have seen it. What is even more telling is the excerpts from the raw sequence that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those that clearly show the far enough distant Earth overshadowed by window frames, and so on. create the illusion of a distant Earth. <br /> <br /> Like most films of this type, Sibrel relies on insinuations, inaccurate assumptions, misleading comments and selective quotations to incite the viewer to accept a conclusion that would not have the least real proof.
