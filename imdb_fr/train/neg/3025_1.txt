this movie is really bad ... no i mean really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. Of all the films he has made, I am only an enemy of the state, apart from being one of the worst filmmakers of all time. What shocked me most was Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) who did the screenplay. now Richard Kelly is a genius to me, but being involved in this project makes you hope he learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> now i like Mickey Rourke's new roles but i can not even like him because of the awful story and look. Do not get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he's had some success in his day and he's one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knightly, I think she's a little overrated. I just can not feel it in the movies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is bad. that's it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
