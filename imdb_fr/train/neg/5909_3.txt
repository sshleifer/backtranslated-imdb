The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved he had only one good idea for the rest of the film. Absolute humor of the lowest common denominator. Painful look. A complete chore. Written probably in less than a week, just like the first. Give the hook to Meyers and lock him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let it go until it has developed a decent scenario for something, anything. He has it in him. These Austin Powers things are simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let Goldmember flow without leaving a trace.
