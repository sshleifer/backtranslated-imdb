As I said, the book was pretty good and it might be a good movie if Melissa Gilbert had not been so awful and amazing in the lead role. What kind of accent was supposed to be anyway? It looked like his horrible Russian accent in another movie in which I saw it. Every time she opened her mouth, I collapsed. It took 3 tries before I could watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as another leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked the location scenes on the beach. They added a little much needed brightness to distract you from the depressing representation of Melissa Gilberts. I think they could have used the views of San Francisco more to their advantage however. It looked like the night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I do not remember that the character of the book was so depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert away from any future movie that needs an accent!
