LOL! This is not a bad way to start. I thought it was original, but then I discovered it was a KING KONG remake clone of 1976. I never saw KING KONG until I was 15 years old. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. The funky disco music of the movie will get stuck in your head! Not to mention the movie theme song by the Yetians. This is the worst creature effect I have ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a holy grail of Series B movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have the Yeti power." I remember seeing this film on MOVIE MACRABE presented by Elvira. There is a scene where it was as if KING KONG was reversed! In KING KONG, he catches the girl and climbs into the building, but in this film, he goes down into the building and catches the girl (who was falling)! Around the same year, another KONG clone, MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977), came from Hong Kong. There are many matte travel scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will make you laugh. It's like I said, just another KING KONG clone. PG rated for violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
