I wanted to hit the TV. Watching was torture. I hated. Never look at this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I normally like it but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. It's the most irritating film in the world. The comedian of whom he is jealous is odious. The only fun remote part is the black-toothed rocker that attracts all girls. It was so irritating that I wanted to hit the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOUNCE SOMEONE. If you like even a little Adam Sandler, do not buy it. It'll just make you hate it. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. It's a waste of $ 1.99 that I paid for it.
