This is the first time I've done a non-zombie subgenre review, but this movie is worth evaluating. Dinocroc is a good film in general, but unfortunately, it remains obvious. The Dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought that the film itself needed a little more weight, both in terms of action and violence, because every time the fang is shown or is in a fight scene, not much happens except that the hook is shown and the hook kills or runs in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is an advantage and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the hook looked fleshy instead of looking like a cough caricature *, a curse of cough komodo *. I enjoyed this film enough to be happy that there is a sequel, which is more than I can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and deserves some surveillance.
