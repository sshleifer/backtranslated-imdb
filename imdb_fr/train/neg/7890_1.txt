How sad that there is no option to display a score lower than 1. I looked at this nonsense and I could hardly believe what I was watching. Every part of the movie was awful. Music, acting, staging, history, everything, just everything. In fact, I burst out laughing at different times in the film. I particularly liked the moment when our hero rushes idle into the hospital with soft focus, and drops the nurses' clipboard, because, well, ............ .. Just because. Product placement? Crucifixes are everywhere. If you are of Christian conviction and very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get out more.
