This entry Drummond lacks continuity. Most of them have elements of foolishness, the postponed marriage, etc. However, there is a series of endless events taking place in the dark as characters move from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol who is so obvious a suspect that no one seems to even look. He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious, but Drummond and people do not seem to understand anything. Nevertheless, it is a reasonably good action and a good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic character, but like Nigel Bruce in the movie Rathbone Sherlock Holmes, he's so foolish It's hard to imagine a person who has a taste or intelligence around him. Is there a story behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became associated?
