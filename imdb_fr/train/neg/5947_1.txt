It's one of the most hateful and cruel movies I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was fooled to stick to that because Donald Sutherland's presence gave him some credibility. [This is the last time this will happen.] <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren's character was annoying and as stupid as he was. There were smarter characters than his own who were killed in the movie. This is one of the many things in this film that asked me, "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is the late-night cable so full of sadistic waste filled with pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on their terror and murder. This film could have been just as suspensive without being sick and twisted in the process. All she ends up doing is tormenting the viewer with her illness and insulting her intelligence. <br /> <br /> The distribution is misleading. I guess they first SUGGESTED Sutherland and used it to attract others as lemmings. <br /> <br /> I blame myself for wasting time giving this garbage a chance.
