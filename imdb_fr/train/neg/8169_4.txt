The film begins with two campers, a man and a woman presumably together, who walk alone in the vast wilderness. Of course, the man hears something and chagrinates him so much that he learns. Our killer greets him with a punch in his stomach. He then pursues the girl and cuts her throat. The camera during the opening scene is from the killer's point of view. <br /> <br /> We then meet our four main characters, two couples, one in the rocks. The men joked that the woman would never be able to handle the double-date camping alone, thus sparking the ambition of the symbolic blonde to leave a week earlier. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down. They end up arriving in the evening. When men arrive, they are warned by Ralph doppleganger, a madman, about the disappearance of people in the forest. They ignore the warning and venture into the dark night. A song of the eighties plays in the background with lyrics about the murder in the dark forest. Men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not just another clone of The Burning, but a ghost story! The women, frightened and alone, huddle by the fireside. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play voyeur. Well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices sound! Their mother appears with blood flowing from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they saw her children, before disappearing of course. <br /> <br /> Children run home to Dad and tell him about the two beautiful ladies in the river. This causes great agitation and he gets up, grabbing his knife from the top of the fireplace. "Dad goes hunting" exclaims the little girl with bad action. It is obvious here that the father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Flipped by something in the woods, the symbolic blonde lunges, rushing blindly into the night, a knife in her hand. She meets the father who explains to him that he is dying of hunger and it will be fast. That makes no sense because of the panther grunts we heard earlier (maybe he's allergic! Are the Panthers honestly even in California?) She ends up hurting him slightly before he gets hurt. stab the head. A storm breaks out and the men seek shelter, which turns out to be where Dad lives. It is clear that someone lives here because there is a fire and something strange is burning it. The children appear and warn them of dad who shows up a few moments later. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our murderer is attacking women. He invites men to eat something and tells us the story of his ex-wife. We have a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating. The old man does not tell them that he then kills her and her lover, but dreams of it. We are not given the reason for the disappearance of children. The men go to sleep and are left unharmed. The next morning, the men discover the empty campsite of their wives. After a brief discussion, they separate. One is staying at the campsite while the other is looking for help. Whoever returns to his car breaks a leg. We then meet the children who explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who have killed themselves for being sad for their mother. They pledge to help the woman find her friends <br /> <br /> The next scene defies the logic of the film when dad kills the guy waiting on the campsite. He was also a couple or married to the blonde. In one way or another, the children realize that he is murdered and talk to the woman. She decides to see it for herself and obviously meets the killer. Fortunately, the children have him arrested, threatening to leave him forever. You know where it's going. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film deserves four stars out of ten, which is generous. Despite all his worries, the score is well done. It's always visible. Some camera angles look professional and some sets are well made. The plot is amazing. There is such a thing as the voluntary suspension of disbelief, but with the toad at 6 miles away; I can not imagine that the symbolic blonde takes off like that in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
