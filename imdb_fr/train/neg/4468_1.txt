OK, if you're a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM THE LEGEND. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt the most disappointing game of TR. It looks very beautiful, it sounds great, but it's totally unplayable and I gave up. I feel like I have been stolen by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game first and foremost. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games, the controls were standard. In AOD, they were "sticky", but kept the same general control sequences. In Legend, they have completely changed their control and movement methods and they are totally out of control. <br /> <br /> I saw comments elsewhere from people who said "use the mouse". No, why should I? Others say "Use a gamepad". No, why should I? Others say "But this is the norm for 3rd person orders for years" Well, I do not care, this is the norm for no other TR game, so why play with it? Oh, I know, because they did not care about their original and loyal fanbase, they wanted to enjoy new kids who had not even heard of the show until the movies came out and won a lot more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to all serious fans of TR is to get away from this game and, if you buy it, you will complain to Eidos. I've seen a lot of publications, mostly on the Eidos forums, about people telling them how bad it is, they might listen.
