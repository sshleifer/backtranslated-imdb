The cast of this film contains some of the best actors in New Zealand, many of whom have been seen in fabulous roles. This film, however, fills me with a deep shame of being just the same country as them. False American accents are the first clue that things will soon turn out badly dramatically. As another clever review notes, the luxury cruise ship is actually an old ferry, decorated with some of the multicolored flags stolen from a lot of used cars. Most of the actors seem to come from New Zealand's (long) soap opera Shortland Street. It's as if this film was imagined at a Christmas party at Shortland Street's cast, a result of too much gins and maybe a little salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" and "The Love Boat", staged by your local primary school and run by an autistic. You understood the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend you see this film as a study on how to destroy your caregiver.
