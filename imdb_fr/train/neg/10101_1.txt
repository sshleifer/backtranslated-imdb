Notice that I gave this star 1 if the option was given I would have given this zero. As I put this DVD on my TV and sat on my couch, I was expecting the worst film to be made at its best. I watched this movie on IMDb and saw it was the lowest rated movie, so I guess I went into the movie criticizing every mistake. But that did not prepare me for shit that was about to throw up on my TV screen. <br /> <br /> The box gives this film the appearance of looking good at best. DO NOT LET THAN YOU. This film must be banned from all shelves in the world. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is like porn but without sex scenes. The acting game (if you can call it that), the plot (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese) and the special effects are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be fun to watch. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm not saying that I can make a better movie than this one, but I think so.
