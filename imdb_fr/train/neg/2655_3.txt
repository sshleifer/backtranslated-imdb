** 1/2 for this farce Diane Keaton. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Ms. Keaton, enough with your philosophy and hats for Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> This movie is too much Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who was not reachable by phone at first, because she was in the bag with her buddy and took out the phone jack, is crying in a new way for the plaintiffs. <br /> <br /> She retired to the summer area where Sara's friends stayed. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then starts revealing things that were better not to reveal. It seems that sweet Sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who finally married her. Besides, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We are all now engaged in this journey of guilt. <br /> <br /> His only hope is to find the elusive journal Sara has kept. She also hopes that her boyfriend, Adam, who is a playwright, will not include all of this in another room. <br /> <br /> When the newspaper is found, it was written in Japanese. Sara had a doctorate in this language. It's not very good news for mom to translate a newspaper excerpt by a Japanese cook into a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything seems to end in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from the Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sara spoke, they both said Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, during this strange show of mourning, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen in his movie, Interiors, where he tried to emulate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Ms. Keaton is also trying drugs with the group. Come on, people, can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could cry like that? <br /> <br /> Fair to mediocre summarizes the film best.
