Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the film: Faces that are too long usually only give the impression that the bottom half of the film is missing (the screen is cut off) because there seems to be some action important going on, but you can not see them. There is anyway too much confusion in the film, so these angles of view aggravate the situation and do not contribute to clever visuals. <br /> <br /> I like clever movies and unconventional work with the camera. I can handle slow and deep films. But this one tries too much to be clever and fails in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Nothing to attach to any of the characters, because they are not worked well enough. To develop characters, it takes more than simple head shots, at least with this set scenario-director-actors. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the less good actors are due to the scenario and director or due to the actors. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from movies written and directed by The You in the future. <br /> <br /> What a boring movie, even for someone who would be interested in this part of the story and for someone who has spent time in Shanghai.
