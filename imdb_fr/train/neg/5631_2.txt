The photograph on the DVD is so dark that I thought the screen was dead. I think I missed seeing half of the movie. Still, it was poorly designed and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but I did not get involved enough after the first pictures. I rented the film especially for Willem Dafoe and I was sad to lose his talent. I do not think Giada Colagrande studied filming long enough to develop a great film. She is attractive and could become an actress, but she has too many tasks in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem credible. I do not understand why the other characters were even introduced in the plot.
