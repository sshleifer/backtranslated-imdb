OK, I admit, the beginnings are very nice and good, but after that, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar would have even finished reading the screenplay after about 5 minutes in the movie, the only reason I sat throughout the film. film, did I want to see the turn to the ned, and to my surprise, well, people I can not even tell you if there was one, because the end just leaves you confused, and then the role of credit, I was like what hell? it did not deserve a theatrical release, I'm sorry, but that did not mean it was horrible, the only reason I gave it a 4 was because there were some nervous parts .. . that's all! you can look at it, I'm not telling you not to do it, you might even like it or even like it! but if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
