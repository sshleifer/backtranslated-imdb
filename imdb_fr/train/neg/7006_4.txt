Mark Hamill should have felt embarrassed by CORVETTE SUMMER! This time, he uses a new kind of "force" to regain possession of the machine of his dreams, a bright red "Vette". It sounds like another bitter teen movie during the first half hour and turns around in the wrong direction. The writing and realization tasks are terribly finished, with some scenes that you can not easily take. Anyway, you expect that to happen, and you also smell the mishmash of the late '70s. Only an old newcomer, like Annie Potts, could easily steal the show and save that. poor film of the reserve. Her uncomfortable but charming personality holds your interest in good, and it's the best chance to see her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I guess Force was not with you this time.
