I bought this DVD for my brother who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty entertaining piece containing two completely separate stories. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the most interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had a lot of short and unsatisfactory relationships. She literally runs into Brian Kerwin (a guy married to Kids) after driving his car to the back of his. After being initially hostile to each other, he suggests taking her home because she does not feel comfortable driving her anymore. The romance develops and eventually leads to a tragedy when his wife discovers it. What happens in the end did not prepare me, but the slow pace and televised routine removes all drama from the plot. <br /> <br /> The other section is about an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section has the best distribution with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio head but in the end, when asked to resign, they all realize that their career will now go nowhere. <br /> <br /> It's time consuming but it's not very interesting and I'm glad it was not bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer but she was certainly the only actor to watch in this movie and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. All in all, unless you're a fan, avoid that because it's very common.
