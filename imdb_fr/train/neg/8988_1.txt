So far, the worst film I have ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You should really check the reviews for this movie instead of this one. The critical statistics for this film have been positively distorted by a relentless and unscrupulous push from some of the people involved in its production, evidence for which it is quite easy to find information online. At least the creators of Ben & Arthur have had the honor to let him stand on his trembling legs, instead of promoting it without scruple so that cupping like me buy it. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is terrible, the script, the story, the cast, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music ... what else in a movie? Anything here is as serious as possible. If it was not so unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I kept looking at him, thinking that he needed to improve, because I had not yet discovered that any positive comments about him were reliable. <br /> <br /> It does not take a lot of money to make a good movie, A small budget does not mean that a movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a low-budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sant's incredible Mala Noche, but there are many more. Sideline Secrets ?? Director's Cut or original ?? is not bad because the people who made it have no money, but because they have a huge ego and have no talent for anything except personal promotion.
