This is exactly the type of film that frustrates me the most. Excellent distribution, good director, good story potential, then they ruin everything with a scenario that goes nowhere ... and that says nothing by going there! There is no depth here whatsoever. No depth of character, no depth of intrigue, no depth of surprise, suspense or common sense. We know what's going on, we're told how they plan to solve the problem, they solve the problem, we throw a surprise near the end without generating suspense, then they end the film abruptly. A missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, Glenn Ford leads a troupe of fantastic British (and French) actors, performing incredibly impressive work with the unidimensional script that has been assigned to them. Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie" is one of the absolute favorites. It brings humor and warmth to a dark and serious film. I also thought that the movie had a great look ... all shadows and fog ... very dark in the movie. <br /> <br /> Even if the actors do their best and the staging is enjoyable, it is not enough for me to recommend spending time watching the movie. There are much better films from Glenn Ford: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, and so on.
