The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor. A visual feast for the eyes, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. At first, Dietrich and Boyer's idea of ​​leaving religion to "find" their capacity for love intrigued me. What follows is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and we feel his torment. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe surpasses his performance - his mask is sometimes scary to watch - an insensitive mask. As a monk, Boyer held the formula of the liquor of the monastery (which reminds me of the true story of the Chartreuse): when he abandons his "marriage to God", the reaction of his fellow monks is shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer was rid of his past. However, the following trip is too predictable.
