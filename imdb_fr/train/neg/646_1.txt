I saw this film by accident and this film was an accident ... well it had to be. blond women being stalked, the wicked appearing and disappearing moving from one place to another in one minute then disappearing and reappearing, hiding. He was not even a superhero, so I do not know how he did it. He could not scare a cat and it's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> the old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer scary. In fact, it stopped being scary years ago. you had the cop in the footsteps of the villain, another clich√© (played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent, he is from London), the director had no idea and made a movie full of "frightening movements "" that was a scary comedy look pathetic!
