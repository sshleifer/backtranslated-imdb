DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that has been screened continuously on Sky Movies in Britain. Since it seemed to be projected about three times a week for a full year, I do not know how I missed it until it was first broadcast on the network. television tonight. In fact, since I'm not a big fan of horror movies, the reason was probably due to my theory that it was going to be a tripet. My theory has proven right for most <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINI SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of stupid scripts involved. For example, at the beginning of the movie, the villains fly from Dracula's coffin to London in America (in a propulsive bi-propeller plane!) And one of the villains stays alone in the cargo hold where Dracula comes to life. A fight bursts, there is a lot of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit do not hear sound until the script asks for it. It also appears in the climax of this segment that Dracula can control the weather, but this seems forgotten as the movie progresses. Loose scripts, and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there are many character scenes taking place at Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and then the characters at another location, such as a police station in the next scene, then they come back to Mardi Gras the scene after which means that the lack of credibility in the plot is strengthened <br /> <br /> There is something else that pulled my chain - the placement of product. There are countless scenes where the logo of a certain chain of record stores is visible. I would not dare to advertise the brand of the company (except to say that they also run a train company that is a national joke in Britain), but I had the impression that this type of advertising was against British Broadcasting Guidelines and I am surprised that the BBC has shown this film if it is. <br /> <br /> DRACULA 2000 has some positive aspects, such as visual elements, for example. It's actually a beautiful movie with a nice cast and a nice boy where these vampire girls were hot, but that's something we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - a very beautiful, very stupid movie
