The premise of the film has been explained and if you are so far away, you can not pretend that I am a movie critic. That said, my own opinion of the film is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but that falls into the category of his not so big work with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (a lot). <br /> <br /> The film seems to get a free pass because it's a Takashi film and nothing that Takashi does can be wrong. It is an approach of high school students in the cinema. For the rest of us, we'll find an hour and a half of a child screaming for no real reason and completely boring (and yes, that removes the film), the rhythm of the film reaching almost levels of rigomortis. acting ... well ... humm. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Takashi, you will see it regardless of your interest. It lacks any originality (see The Neverending Story) or any character development of the main character in the face of a conflict other than superficial. <br /> <br /> As has been pointed out, this is the first film credited for Miike's co-writing, but that does not mean much, because what we hope to be Miike's personality would overflow in the screen. All we get are some of Miike's clich√©s to the director of photography. <br /> <br /> The film had the potential to be great. The premise is not difficult to unleash. But this one seemed to have been thrown to the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that if you stick to Miike, stick to certain standards such as Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then film in his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
