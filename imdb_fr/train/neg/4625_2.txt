How did 4 out of 16 voters give this film a 10? How could more than half of previous voters give it a 7 or more? Who votes here? I can only assume that they are mostly children - very young children. The fact is that it's a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid. the acting is difficult to imagine; the characters are without character; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In case it is rebroadcast, I suggest you read a book instead.
