May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say it, but anyone who has the courage to read this can probably understand that every plot turns from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that I liked. I did not hate it like some movies that insult your intelligence, but everything seemed too predictable in search of the happy ending that was needed. There were certainly fun passages on the course, but few were original. At least it was not chosen. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually the only redemptive feature. Everyone is in a cardboard cut, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who had to do that a favor to someone. <br /> <br /> In total, it's an hour and a half harmless, without being inspiring.
