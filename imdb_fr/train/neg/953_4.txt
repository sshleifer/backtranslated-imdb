"Happy Go Lovely" has only two goals. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British version (Excelsior Films) of an M-G-M musical with second-tier stars. I imagine that Vera-Ellen interpreted this role thinking that it could finally propel her to the rank of major musical star. But I'm sorry to say that Ms. Ellen's luck has not paid off. <br /> <br /> The opening with a horrible Scottish number and the stumbling of a frightful dialogue until the next dull piece, this film seems very hard neglected. The mistaken and predictable identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is quite superior in his role as producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally ruined in a nil role), the rest of the cast is totally forgettable. <br /> <br /> The choreography is boring, but Mrs. Ellen gives it all. She has never been as famous as most other music stars (and she should not, either, because she did not know how to sing and even had a role as a "dancer" in many of her pictures. "But when she danced, it was just spellbinding. <br /> <br /> Too bad that this movie that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
