It was really awful! He had a terrible storyline, was misinterpreted and looked like an amateur remake, but not as good. <br /> <br /> It took all my tenacity to succeed through this one, it's a good job I did not have to visit the toilet otherwise I doubt that I would have returned! It makes Hammer House of Horror look like a Hollywood epic on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this film is the endless supply of beautiful women. Not a bad one among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to have a drink with your friends after a night of beer, this one is for you ... otherwise avoid it like the plague!
