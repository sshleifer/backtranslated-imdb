I was looking forward to this movie. It's a good family movie. however, if the editing team of Michael Landon Jr. did a better editing job, the film would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there is another movie in the series, they are all very good. But, if another is made, I beg them to take more care of the assembly. This story was everywhere and did not seem to have a center. This is unfortunate because the other films in the series have been great. I like the story of Willie and Missy; They are both excellent models. In addition, the romantic side of viewers still enjoys a good love story.
