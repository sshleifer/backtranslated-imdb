This film, once sensational for its forward-thinking policies and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced over time to mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this little film, mostly boring, has been banned and seized by the governments of many countries. Given the evolution of socialist Sweden, the "radicalism" of its once-controversial policy appears na√Øve and almost general four decades later. And his sex scenes, both subject to sensational trials of obscenity, seem rather docile in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and accompanying documentaries, detailing its many controversies and influences, remain marginally observable as an early reliquary of the youth rebellion of the sixties. Part of the film that still holds: his self-consciousness compared to the "fourth wall". From time to time, the filmmakers film themselves to make the film. The satirical playfulness of it still gives a little laugh.
