What has become of our dear Ramu? Is it the same man who created Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he clearly jumped off the high cliff that he climbed by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all time. This film is made to fall like a brick. I was anxious to leave the theater, but I had to sit down because I could not get my car out of the parking lot until others had left. Otherwise, nothing would have made me sit beyond the interval. <br /> <br /> This film is nowhere close to Sholay. He does not even approach it within a mile. I think Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic work. I read Ramu's interview a few days ago, in which the investigator said that Ramu did not sleep more than four hours a day, which is not a moment. I totally agree with this, because his lack of sleep has probably had a negative impact on the film. <br /> <br /> The performance is not powerful. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look scary. He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I saw before. Ramu's favorite, Nisha Kothari, did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she did not have much dialogue (in fact, none if I remember clearly). She opened her mouth in this film and found a place in the story. The new guy playing Jai seems to have this impetuous look, but does not handle Jai's role at all. I can not go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too bad for me to handle now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself throughout the movie that I would look again at the original Sholay just to see that he is still there. <br /> <br /> Final result: A horrible film. Media and critics are going to cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind all readers once again, I'm one of Ramu's biggest fans, and I can not even spare him for this act.
