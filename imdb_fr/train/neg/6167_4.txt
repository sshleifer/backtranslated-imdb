Like most people, I was forced to buy this movie because of the images of the mighty Bolo Yeung stuck in the whole box and the assumption (from the aforementioned images and the title of the film) that this film is entirely dedicated to the Beast of the East is deafening for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, to my disappointment, the Chinese Hercules is to Bolo Yeung what No Retreat No Surrender was to Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger was ... erm, Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure on the video box, actual minimum screen time! Never mind! <br /> <br /> The story is pretty basic, but it's done well - the peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises to never fight again. He then runs away to work as a worker on a pier where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy bag that drives him to suspect him to be a formidable fighter (do not know how it works but too bad). Meanwhile, the corrupted boss of the pier passes a bargain with gangsters, granting them exclusive use of the pier. As a result, the workers are thrown into the ear and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, the gangster leader and his henchman, Bolo Yeung. <br /> <br /> quite observable (mainly pending the next preview of Bolo), I had some problems with that - first, the bad dubbing, but of course, this is given in the old movies of Kung Fu. But also, the film tended to slide between the different fight scenes. And with regard to the fight scenes themselves, I found them too long, badly choreographed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Badly shot and sometimes performed by people who seemed to have no aptitude for martial arts. In fact, most of the fights in this movie are not fights at all, but only people who get beat up without any resistance! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero - interpreted by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen other movies with this guy, but at no time did I support him. Not only did he look ugly and at the edge of tears at all times, but I found his insistence not to fight maddening! I understood his reasoning, but he could have spared a lot of suffering for many people if he had done earlier what we all knew he would end up doing, and fight! A bigger mystery was why this whole community of people was basing their hopes on a guy they had never seen fighting against! <br /> <br /> Really, the big help in this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is it as huge and brutal as ever, but it has great fun lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on how to fight in the movies. The guy oozes the presence of the screen and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares me, but I'm sure I was not the only person watching this movie that supported Bolo throughout the final fight! <br /> <br /> In the end, a film of kung-fu below the average allowed to raise several huge receipts thanks to you-know-who. I have never met anyone who did not think that Bolo Yeung was great. The man is a legend !!
