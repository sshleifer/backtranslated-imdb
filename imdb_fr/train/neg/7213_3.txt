Although I certainly consider the exorcist as a horror classic, I must admit that I do not give it the same esteem as many other horror fans. As a result, I have not seen many scams of The Exorcist, and if Exorcismo has enough to pass, I must say that it is a good thing, because this film is boring and certainly not worth the trouble of to be spent ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist scams, this is often considered one of the worst, and maybe it was not the best place for me to start. It's not difficult to guess what the plot will be: basically, it's the same thing as The Exorcist's and we see a girl being possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be her father's spirit deceased). The priest of the village is then called to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror movies, this one stars Paul Naschy, which is about the best in the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the Spanish derivative Giallo "The killer wore gloves". I did not see any of his other films, but based on these two films: I think this originality was not one of his strengths. There are not many good things I can say about the movie itself; most of the time, it is only walking and the exorcism scene is not worth the wait. I certainly do not recommend it!
