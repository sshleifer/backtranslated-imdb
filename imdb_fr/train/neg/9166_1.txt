Search is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say that every movie has a selling point, a gadget. The gimmick of Transformers is its impressive effects and nostalgia. Sleepless in Seattle's gimmick is a matter of situation in her slogan: "And if someone you've never met, someone you've never seen, someone you've never known was the only one for you? " A lot of romance relies heavily on these gadgets and some by the draw of big names. Leap Years employs both using Irish folklore as a circumstance and featuring some of the most famous names in the country. <br /> <br /> The public is now in the cinema, in addition to all the usual elements of characters, conflicts or consequences, crisis, resolution and resolution, they also hope for a stimulating dialogue, more absorbing situations due to the years leaps, interesting secondary intrigues and perhaps, to a certain extent, a good turn in the middle or the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> That's what Jean Yeo is trying not to realize. If they tried to do it, their goal was apparently in the other yard, in the other stadium, on the other side of the planet. She and her author, Alain Layrac, have completely failed to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines were artificial. It looks like they have a bag full of lines that she would like to use in her movie: "Ok, those are the lines and quotes I've heard or read from movies I've seen or books that I had read before, and they all sound good to me.If they sound good to me, they will sound good for the audience, so all I have to do is copy them all together, I'll use them all "The result is cathartic. I can not say that the replies were useless and have nothing to do with the story or the conspiracy, but they seem to come out of nowhere, taking you by surprise with these quotations. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotes based on most situations in our dialogue, trying to make them meaningful to them while shaking their heads. I do not go out with them anymore because the urge to hit them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the characters represented are stupid and one-dimensional. With the exception of the unnatural dialogue that involves their motivation (necessary to drive the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. These are all simple people who spring from the lines of the advice column of a women's magazine. <br /> <br /> The leap year gadget is not enough to lead the story, because the circumstances are too superficial. Again, there are movies with less, but they are doing better than that, they are not there. They invented my first and second point. In addition, subplots are irrelevant (not that it's a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass the terrible plot with places of good photography. Indeed, they probably understand that it is possible and easier to get approval from some viewers than others with the proper use of cinematography, soundtrack and location. These unsuspecting spectators. <br /> <br /> It's not even the kind of movie that's so bad that it's good. It's just bad. Do not look at that.
