This film is one of the worst I've known for a long time. <br /> <br /> This is a crime and comedy drama featuring two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, who are investigating a shootout at a hip-hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is artificial and the secondary problems are far too numerous. Ford takes care of real estate (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he pushes girls in his free time, both are investigated by Home Affairs , Ford fucks the ex-girlfriend (Lena Olin) of the IA investigator and a psychic who has a radio show, the man who organized the assassination at the club is a dirty ex-cop who shot the Hartnett's father years ago. <br /> <br /> obligatory car chases and some lame attempts at humor, that's the essence of this turkey.
