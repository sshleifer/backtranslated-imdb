If you liked the movie Grinch ... check it out again, because it was not as good as the translation of a Seussian movie. Mike Myers' cat is probably the most annoying character to have "magnified" the screen lately. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with a terrifying sound, which is pretty much the only laugh I've heard at the theater. Even the kids did not like that, and the kids made fun of everything now. Save your money and check out Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun movie for families.
