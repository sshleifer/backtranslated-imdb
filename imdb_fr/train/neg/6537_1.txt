First of all, know that I saw this film on television and with its nickname of English, which may have completely ruined the atmosphere. However, I will note what I saw and I hope it will keep people away from this version. I found this film extremely dull. The dubbing has lost all the atmosphere of the film, leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst film in my book about sin is being slow, except when it comes to the film about philosophy. I did not see any deep philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to say it as I see it. I noted it "1". What can I say, tastes geared towards the United States, perhaps.
