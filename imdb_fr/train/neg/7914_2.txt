This movie was supposed to be a hit movie, and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn and watch flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie delivers, maybe not as good as the ultra-flashy Iron Man, but good. Apart from the action and special effects of popcorn, the film falls off the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, including myself, will complain about how most of the characters have been badly altered, but that just makes the movie a bad adaptation, not a bad movie. This film is not satisfactory for other reasons. Manufacturers have been more focused on making it attractive to the eye than to the mind. The long-awaited and promoted characters are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The other characters are thrown to the side of the road to give place to the glory to the eyes. The character of Wolverine is fully developed after 30 minutes, as well as Sabertooth, although Victor has some surprises in the film. <br /> <br /> The "last boss" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show why he is as he is. Filmmakers obviously thought that all they needed was to create a bad ass character who could do whatever they wanted and slap the name of a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
