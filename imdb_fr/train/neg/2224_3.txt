I saw this for the first time when I was about 7 years old. I remembered what I thought was a vague description of what had happened. Fifteen years later, I remembered everything with great precision, because it seems that the writers have never been content to give a glimpse of history. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no story, no arc of character, nothing. Good people do things because they are good, while bad guys do things only because they are bad. An unintentionally hilarious part is the death of someone you think would be important and nobody cares in the least. They shrug their shoulders and move on. There is almost no dialogue either. If you cut combat scenes and current scenes, you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Look at this because you want to see good animation and for no other reason. Or if you like to watch hotly dressed cartoon chicks (or hotly dressed cartoon dudes).
