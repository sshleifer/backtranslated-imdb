The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. A story of Lady and the two-way tramp - rich girl / poor boy and ability vs lineage. The sequel, however, is not just a shameless attempt to capitalize on the name of the original, but also a ridiculous and exaggerated disfiguration of Disneyfied, better summed up as "Rambo meets the black stallion". Without the charm of the black stallion. The young hero returns from an absence of three years and suddenly becomes Superman on horseback. in the original, good movie, it was real and credible, but unfortunately reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I was not so disappointed with a movie, and sometimes it pissed me off - they barely missed a cliche. Bold Audience Manipulation - Do studio leaders think that all you have to do with an audience that loves horses is to put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy? A movie mess.
