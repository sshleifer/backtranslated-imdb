I remember when I saw this film for the first time, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw that, I had listened to the original Broadway recording, and I really liked it! But when I saw that, I thought, what's this mess ?! This film misses many songs of the musical to shout loudly! Who decided to do all this ?! <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical he's ever done! The movie looked more like a Hollywood setting than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who the hell decided to remove all the songs of Meg from the movie ?! <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that, when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe probably wondered, "Who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably angry at the fact that Hollywood turned their beautiful musical into a pretty virgin movie. audition brilliantly, but you're in a movie that's missing a lot of text. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want a good film based on a musical of Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
