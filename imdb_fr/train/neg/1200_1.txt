A VERY boring, obvious and tedious exorcist scam featuring a red-eyed Doberman - that's the scale of the special effects of this cheap movie designed for television. Richard Crenna is about as animated as a chew toy. The dress and music of the 70s only add to the torture. You should fall asleep almost as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Virtually valueless. MooCow says eaghhh what a stinking dog! : = 8P
