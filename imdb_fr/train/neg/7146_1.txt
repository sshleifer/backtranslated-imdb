I signed up just to make this comment (which already echoes some of those already here). The acting is worse than normal, it exposes common stereotypes, presents some of the worst displays of insipid objectification of women (all brainless), and has some of the most cheese lines known to man. <br /> <br /> including, but not limited to, "fine, let's see what these guys can do", I should also mention that when they show collisions involving innocent civilians, feel bad for the innocent and start hating the characters themselves. The character of Eddie Griffin is also one of the most stereotypical black characters who rub people upside down. It may not be a good actor, but this movie does not allow this type of character exploration. You want a film that leaves the public on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars can not compensate for this accident of the film. This Enzo that Griffin destroyed perfectly summarizes this film. It just sucks.
