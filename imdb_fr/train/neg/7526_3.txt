It's a high quality cheese made from kung fu movies. Bruce "wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, let's show Bruce's quick clips and make close-ups of his eyes. If you bend at a certain angle during a certain time of the day during the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You will not be able to laugh at the fact that the splicing of the film is not very good, but beautiful deleted scenes of Enter the Dragon are also added. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while he was suspended from a helicopter. Of course, they think it may excuse Bruce Li for trying to become Bruce while his character is supposed to be Bruce's brother (who, for whatever reason, still mimics Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very POOR). See Bruce go head-to-head with the loose lion. The accessories department stopped at Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with hitting a crippled man savagely. Towards the end, the director decided to "throw a flashback" for a scene that has just been presented 3 minutes ago !! They had to think that only unicellular organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
