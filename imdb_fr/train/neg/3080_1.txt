Hey hey. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it's really bad. I remember the day I saw this for the first time on MST. The sun was shining and seemed like a good day. Then, I saw this Rick Sloane product, made up of horrible stuffed dolls ravaging the land of the eighties feasts. Extraordinary, Kevin tries to impress his girlfriend, runs a security assistant position, fight with rakes and many other things in this series of very poorly made images. No plot or story is necessary. Obviously, no actor is needed as the film proves. An army guy and his crazy sex girl will make you want to jump off a cliff, and the idiotic friend who takes his foot on the sex phone will make you say, "He has beautiful red shorts". Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wanted him to have an accident in his supermarket cart. Just when you think it's over, wait for the Scum Club stage. Ask Road Rash. <br /> <br /> After watching this film, I advise you to spend a good month to find your senses and your sanity. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick in the groin to show how much we appreciate this Hobgoblins crapster.
