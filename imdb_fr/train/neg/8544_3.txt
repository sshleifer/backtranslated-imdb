I never knew where this thing was going. These people seem interested in what is happening on some mountains. They investigate, have narrow escapes, leave, return, leave, endanger themselves, walk in sleep, are attacked by witches who have substantial wardrobes, etc., etc. . She is abducted, he recovers her, leaves her. You get the point. All of this seems to lead to some kind of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure, or turn people into wizards, but I'm not sure. It's just dull and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the impression is so bad that there are times when twenty seconds of darkness are not unusual. Is it due to the age or overuse of night filters?
