An apparently vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a hottie Charles Bronson wiping the "scum" who assaulted his parents, his grandparents or something and impressed his young guys with his karate skills. In a pivotal scene, she intervenes to stop a rape and an imbecile police officer throws her into prison. After two scenes of fresh showers and a barking dyke seduction from prison, she must do herself justice blah blah blah. I guess there have been a lot of movies like this? The script is stupider than usual if you can believe it. Mani appears as the kind of showbiz that would co-produce his own role in Death Wish, and I find this guy sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ugly device. Skilled actors would be wasted in the roles of bastards here and would actively undermine the fantastic DA incompetent in mining and a judge who must be the producer's uncle.
