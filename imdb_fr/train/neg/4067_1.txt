Am I wrong or is the 2007 version a scam of the original? I have to ask the question because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad game, bad editing, etc. The only "exploitation" aspect of this film is the way we were ripped off. money by buying this shit. It's nothing more than a light porn movie ... no gore, no scary images, just some cheap junk. If anyone wants to see an excellent movie without an actor name, gooey gore and a decent story ... Get Baby Blood ... also on a budget cheap but well done ... and a real story too! I Spit was a waste of money but I'll just keep it to laugh .... it's pathetic! New comment .... September 3rd ..... I'll keep this movie forever just because it's so bad it's almost good ... in a really bad way .... the worst acting game of all time ... a true classic movie-scrap!
