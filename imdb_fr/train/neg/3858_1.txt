What a terrible, TERRIBLE, movie! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I usually like movies like this, all "A guy meets an eccentric woman he loves, but he's already involved in someone who does not suit him ...." I was expecting something predictable and I did not care. Movies are always fun, mixing the right amount of romance and comedy, but not that one! Each joke falls flat and the "novel" makes me want to throw up. The main character is one of the most "kills me" characters I have ever seen on television, the "eccentric woman" is not very quirky, but rather weird and annoying. The "other person" is the most reasonable and mature person in this film, but it is equally annoying. This film is rubbish, there is no way to get around it, do not waste your time.
