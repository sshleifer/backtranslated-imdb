I will have to disagree with the previous comment and be with Maltin on this one. It is a second-rate western, excessively vicious, cracking and moaning trying to highlight its central theme: the Wild West is tamed and sidelined by the constant march of time. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" but lacks the poignant character and charm of this film. The management of Andrew McLaglen is soft and the last 30 minutes are a real failure, with an incomprehensible strategy from the heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone yelling at me if you can explain to me why they set this hill on fire.) There was something cruel in all the treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction after the fact did not ring certainly not true. Coburn is very mean because the half-breed has escaped the convict to avenge himself, but all his escaped companions are underdeveloped (they are bowling pins that must be reversed one by one while the story advances forward). Michael Parks gives one of his sneaky, lethargic and murmuring performances, but in this case it was fitting that his modern-day sheriff symbolized the complacency that technological progress can engender.
