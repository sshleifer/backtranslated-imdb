SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br /> <br /> The Gettaway is primarily an action movie. And what action there is !! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much more. It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coys. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I did not see the original, but I did not care about this one even though Bassenger and Baldwin have a nice screen. chemistry. But the film itself did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> The Gettaway became very tiring very quickly. The plot is overshadowed by one fight or pursuit after another, and as violence continues to accumulate, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their beautiful appearance, no matter how dangerous they are. In fact, at the end of the movie, they almost look better early. I do not think Bassenger's eye makeup changes once. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've seen, certainly not, but it's not very good and unless one is an action movie purist I do not really appreciate this movie because there are not many here. The Gettaway is not terribly original either, and goes from brutally useless to rather boring. It could have been better in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give acceptable performances, but they do not have much to do except to chase and run away. Sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again, it becomes obsolete. I did not really appreciate this one.
