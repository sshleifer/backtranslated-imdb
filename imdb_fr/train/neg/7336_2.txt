It is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant pieces. I can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has never been exposed to Shakespeare. In doing so, however, by clarifying each line and intention, they have emptied the game of life and made it a flat caricature. In a way, it's actually boring - a very difficult feat given such a wonderful material. <br /> <br /> The interpretation is at best forgotten - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, are not doing so well. April Shawnham's Hero is a panting fly head that often causes grimaces. Jerry Mayer's Don John is an absurd cartoon character at Snidely Whiplash (though Snidley is a lot nicer). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) Is not in this version, unless he's disguised and his name is stricken from the credits. <br /> <br /> Given that the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically god of the theater, this production is not only disappointing, but puzzling. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with that. Look rather Branagh's Much Ado - its version is brimming with vitality and humor, not to mention wonderful performances.
