I saw this movie recently in a film festival. This is the romance of a former alcoholic unemployed who has just emerged from a great depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the film's "social" theme and transforming it into a sentimental comedy. The main actor did a good job. He certainly looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not credible as a woman of the working class. What I mean is that Ana Belen is playing herself. She does it anyway in all her movies. The whole staging of the film was very poor. The photograph is ugly, does not use the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue seems totally written and dull most of the time. The comical situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case, they are not funny at all and are poorly resolved. In my opinion, this film is not worth seeing. Only if you really like Pereira's previous films, you may like this one a bit. In any case, I left the theater because I felt that I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder what a director feels when he sees someone coming out of one of his movies, especially one that is made to please everyone.
