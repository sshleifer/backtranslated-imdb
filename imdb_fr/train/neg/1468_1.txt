A wonderful distribution wasted in a worthless scenario. A dozen adults meet at the summer camp they attended while they were minors. Could this happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy, and boring to that. Do they become teenagers again? Do they reconstruct their jokes, games, good times? They can try, but in the end, the answer is no. Is there a plot? A suspense? Horror? The comedy? None of these answers. How everyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me. I wanted to love this movie; I tried to love this movie, but my brain refused.
