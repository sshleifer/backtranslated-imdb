Fragmentaric film about a couple of people in Austria during a heat wave. This kind of movie was done more often, and above all, better. The stories really have nothing to do with each other, except for the pathetic ending: "people are cruel". Ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a film that lasts too long without really making a point ... Ultra realistic? Barely ... boring? Effectively. Even the superb Franzisca Weiss can not save this one! 3/10
