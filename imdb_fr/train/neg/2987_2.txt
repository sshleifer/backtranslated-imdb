The dubbing / translation in this film is downright hilarious and constitutes the only entertainment in this dull and derivative zombie movie. I did not laugh as much in my life as watching Zombi 3 (and I saw very bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, filmmakers could reissue this film and release it as a comedy and earn millions of dollars. It's just funny. <br /> <br /> But ... If falling from your couch laughing dubbing in a movie for zombies Fulci is not your cup of tea, avoid it at all costs.
