I watched the movie "The Flock" because of the cast of Gere and the Danes and because the synopsis of the story seemed interesting. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen turkeys.) I had never posted online before, but this movie was so awful that I had to do it. I guess the problems start with the scenario that was so amateurish that it's amazing. History makes no sense and the dialogue is so commonplace that it's nauseating. Poor Man, he deserves so much better. As for the Gere / Danes games on screen, because of the horrible writing, we do not believe any of the characters for a minute. I bet Gere wants to buy back the negative, if such a thing was possible. It's a shame to see the talent wasted so badly, not to mention the fact that I would like to recover my 2 hours. (I know what you think, how do I really feel?)
