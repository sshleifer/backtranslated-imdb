I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was and it's still one of my favorite drawings, if not my favorite. I learned a lot from geography and history through the field visit of the spin-off Inspector Gadget. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective of all time. <br /> <br /> But the film ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, a potential actor, was definitely not the role of Inspector Gadget. First thing in the movie, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves the mystery mainly by himself. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain and the awesome book (I still want his book!). If Gadget has solved the mystery, it is by accident. Gadget in the movie seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon, he was rather silly, where did the humor come from. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it's too much "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. This is not just meant to be a Saturday morning cartoon. Plus, Gadget should never have a love affair, but Disney Corporation is full of fools. <br /> <br /> The real gadgets that Gadget had, and especially his car, I miss too. In the movie, it was a chic convertible. In the cartoon, it was a police car sedan that could turn into a van. He also had a few gadgets and was mainly there to get him from one place to another. <br /> <br /> But if it was something terrible, the only thing that was horrible in the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon. The film was too serious, too exaggerated, had too much intrigue and was not even so funny. <br /> <br /> Advice for those who have not seen it: never see it. ALREADY. Watch the cartoon, it's a real classic.
