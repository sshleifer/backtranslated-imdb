Oh my god I started watching that without knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I was seeing. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government plans to capture the terrorist leader to drop an unarmed man and hopes he will capture him and escape with a pack of rockets. If only it was really so easy. I finally found a film worse than "Plan 9 of Outer Space".
