How can they go from Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second sequel). Why did they do this to.Just Because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser than they should It did not change because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker in the role of Bufford Pusser and that one of things I wanted to see in the second suite. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie a 7 out of 10 and I would have given a 1 in 10 if the story had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life, but it was the reason I gave this movie a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone considering watching this cheese, I suggest not to do it and rather look at the first suite.
