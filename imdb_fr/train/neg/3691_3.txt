I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a huge disappointment. Between a terrible scenario, the action and the songs were only mediocre. The scenario becomes very preached. Instead of running for a job like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seemed like the next big guru in Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that since the release of this movie, Rajni had sworn to shoot more movies! <br /> <br /> We had the good fortune to have bought Babu (a Sivajiganeshan elder) online by accident while trying to buy this one. .... it was a good movie, which compensated for buying this garment ... except that Baba seems even worse in comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
