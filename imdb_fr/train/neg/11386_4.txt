One of these documentaries Thank God, I do not live there. It tells the story of two belligerent factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries, as well as surrounding populations of Medellin. <br /> <br /> Firearms, drugs and death are rampant. Guys, not older than 22, not in the middle of the war are in jail. Girls ?? not women, girls ?? always react in the same way when one of them is killed, in tears and screaming. You scratch your head; what were they really waiting for? I do not know what's more disturbing: night shootings and civil unrest, or the fact that everyone seems to passively accept things as they are. Or, seeing this boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer, having all that, 10 years? If you remove these young men from their situation and give them a place where they can do more, be more numerous, how many would choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> According to this documentary, everyone, I'm scared.
