Only one thing could have bought this sketch. A healthy fight between the happy couple, the exotic model of the delicatessen and the old motel man who watched (he may have turned out) secretly in the woods and who had been an aging farm boy when they 'd shared the rubber house. <br /> <br /> During this process, they could have blown up this frozen hut and solved most of the problems; as the "whore whore" ode on the windshield, the reason why the protagonist had "no friends", while explaining his coolness under the pressure of a bloody pad, incessant phone calls . . . and this chic crawl-space, the green thumb and its attraction for simpler life. Quite the technician with the human body, though. Former abortionist? Officer at the morgue? It would have been nice to feel a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> It was fun to watch these people move, I guess, but Eleanora's stupid Italian games were stereotypical enough that the caretaker had attended too many yoga classes: A dick, a spirit and a van summed it up for him. I wish they had a little more luggage: Eleanora is ready to leave after putting black underwear in her red suitcase and the guard just needs a cardboard box at the motel. <br /> <br />, you can say well. I agree, although the importuning details have simply not been taken into account in this busy work. Good quarrels from owls, though, and I really felt cold all the way through.
