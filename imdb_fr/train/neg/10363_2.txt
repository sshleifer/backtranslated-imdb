I grew up on the intertwined stories of Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a screenwriter would meet his child sitting in a big sofa reading A Winkle in Time and wonder what amazing movie it would be. Unfortunately, the screenwriter failed, changing character, casting a lame humor and destroying the plot. I know it's hard to turn a beloved novel into a movie. But why can not you stay true to the book? Why do you have to change the way characters think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, pick it up, find a fluffy sofa and let your imagination go.
