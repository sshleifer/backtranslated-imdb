There are so many comments on this film that I find misleading. This is a breathtaking and overused scenario in which a normal human being becomes a criminal partner of someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. A boy meets a girl. A girl is holding the boy under the threat of a revolver. The boy is intrigued. <br /> <br /> You know the exercise: the antagonist turns out to be a wild and free spirit instead of a sociopath ... Add some words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for love. Sheedy 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' The role played by The Breakfast Club is simply a main character. And all that's left is a really horrible turkey from a movie.
