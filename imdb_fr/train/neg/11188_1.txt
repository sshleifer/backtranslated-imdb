It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. Already. Period. In fact, I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch that shit of a movie. An incredibly dull, misunderstood, very dramatic, often incoherent scenario and too many scenes that do not seem to be relevant to the whole movie (as when the partner of the priest of Heath Ledger is nailed to the wall by a ghost ... what was the goal answers on a postcard, please ...) <br /> <br /> I should have had a medal to stick with this film for its total duration. I would rather take a hard kick in the groin than see this movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be thrown into the last 100 funds of IMDb. I hope my 1/10 vote will help him on his journey.
