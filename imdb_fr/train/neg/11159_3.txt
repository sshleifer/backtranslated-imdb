I saw this movie in preview and I must honestly admit that I do not like movies with Meryl Streep. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater did not come back after the break in the middle of the film. I could not blame them, if it was not a true story, the second half of the photo was absolutely not necessary. Just before the movie rolled in, about ten years ago, I was expecting credits to appear.
