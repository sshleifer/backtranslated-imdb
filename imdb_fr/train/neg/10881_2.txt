My friend's mother worked in a video store and was able to watch movies before they left. When she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, I could not wait to watch it. Since it's supposed to be scary but really hilarious, I can say that in a way, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so funny! "WHAT DO YOU SMOKE CA-RACK ?!" I did not even know this movie was out ... I thought it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, so ... all in all, the movie is pretty bad (It must be admitted less) but I promise you that you will be tired of laughing. <br /> <br /> * This film is bad, but it's good to laugh ... especially this guy who holds the "dagger of despair" .. THE DAGUE OF DESPAAAAAAIR!
