The next attractions of "The Order" make it a decent horror mystery / thriller, but we get a conspiracy likely to be excellent. All together to form a pile of waste. <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole film is made up of a terrible dialogue and terrible devils. The acting game was not worthy of being proud, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled it out.) Saved the film in this category. <br /> <br /> For heaven's sake: DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!
