Polyester was John Water's very first film I saw, and I must say it was also the "worst" film I'd seen so far. <br /> <br /> The group of "talent" of Water counted several people. who, I'm sure, was working for food and was willing to say the lines written by Waters. Everything in the movie is horrible: actor, camera, montage and the story of a woman interpreted by the 300lb Divine transvestite was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> That said, I must recommend this film because it is very funny, and you will not believe the shit that happens to poor Francine. Her son eliminates solvents and tramples the feet of unsuspecting women in the grocery store. His daughter is the slutiest slut in the city. Her husband is an idiot pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine. <br /> <br /> The only friend of Francine is played by Edith Massey, probably the worst actress of all time. Edith seems to read the lines of a landmark map and never saw the screenplay before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all the defeats of Francine, Waters is preparing a fabulous Hollywood ending and all those who survive) live happily ever after.
