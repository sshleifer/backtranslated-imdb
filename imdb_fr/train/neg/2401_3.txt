I've seen better movies about werewolves in my day, but this one takes the cake. More comical than horror, "Full Moon High" puts the "c" in the cheese party. The quality of star in this film is not bad. The way it was done just sends downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 1950s American football player in a high school that ends up not growing old due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. He drove everyone angry! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who has found his own ball. Adam's father, Alan, plays a psychologist who does not seem to be in top form. After all these years, Tony seems to be very bad at his place because of the attack, and he will then have the chance to take it in his condition. More laughter than bloodshed, this film is only a beginning in the 80s, "Teen Wolf" is an improvement! 1 out of 5 stars.
