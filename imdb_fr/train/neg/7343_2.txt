Have you ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or a Taiwanese movie? Probably for a reason. This one was really boring, even if it contains black magic, including dead corpses and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> Having read the thoughts of others, I expected some violence and gore, but there is not much at all. Some bloody and other lame stuff, if you expect gory or horrible graphic effects, you will be disappointed. Obviously, they did not use explosions of eels and other objects to their full potential. <br /> <br /> The film has almost nothing good; a single character that was not completely bland and some black magic spells OK, like the eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were skinny and boring, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work at all, the most horrible thing was an albino girl (not so scary in reality). It's the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
