It was disappointing. It all started pretty well, but by losing all the opportunities to skyrocket, it fell flat. Maria Schrader's game is awful, he never seems to mean what she says, or even know what she's saying until she says it. She showed no genuine emotion, neither for her beloved goy, nor for her mother's story. When she was with Lena, she seemed to have only an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be any real relationship between Lena and her mother, with the exception of her mother who seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The supposed parallel between Hannah's "mixed" novel and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich√©d as they came and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was totally unconvincing and a stupid finish. The culmination of the protest was not inspiring and, whatever Lena did or did not do to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown a certain complexity of feeling at the time, at a glance. haunted, inexplicably ambivalent. In fact, none of the characters in the film had depth or spark. It was very difficult to look after one of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she reject it then when on the hotel phone?) There was no context or explanation for that.) If all references to it were removed, they would not be noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story made confusing by a poor development of the characters (who was the mother of whom, again?) a weak game, and a staging that makes everyone to play. We could almost hear "calm on the set!", I started to think it was worthy of a 7, but over the course of the film, it fell quickly to 4, then I won a 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene. It was a film as cold and sterile as I saw it. A terrible waste of a good story.
