Whoa. In the twin cities, we have a station that broadcasts the "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. Tonight's nugget was a film with Carrie Fisher titled "She's Back" about a really boring woman who ends up being murdered when thugs enter her home. Bea (Beatrice) returns to haunt her husband. She wants him to seek revenge on his killers, so "she's back". And she will not let him rest until he does. She irritates him constantly ... and the viewers too! This movie is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies, though (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I really shook my head throughout the movie, wondering who thought it would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is so boring. The plot is stupid; the game is bad; the story ... well, you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a very bad movie - really very bad movie, look at this one. You will not be disappointed. He h.
