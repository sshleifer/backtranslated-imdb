Sensational. This film bothered me when I saw it. Bland, useless and motionless. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and his friends. can travel in time with the help of "The Spirit of the Forest" (much more?). There, they meet a kid named Sam and the "plot" begins. <br /> <br /> Then Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) immerse themselves in nature, become hippies and try to free Celebi ("the Spirit") from this weird hunter. I do not even know what else happened. Everything happened in a blur. Ash's friends were barely there and all the fight scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends must return in their time, while watching Sam fly away with Celebi (this scene OO;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash discovers that his new friend is actually the grandfather of his rival. And I think that's it. Pretty retarded is not it? If you love your children, you will not expose them to that. (1 out of 10.)
