Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (still) on trial for her life. As the faithful dog sleeps on the grave of his master, she must be put to death according to the law. Strangely, it is also explained that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which is apparently also contrary to an old Scottish law. If, after three days, no owner is located, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) pleads Lassie's case, which leads to a protracted backlash, showing Lassie's adoption by Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although it is based on an interesting and original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" returns to several previous situations of Lassie; and, that does not improve them. Comparatively, this one is neglected and not very exciting; and, it's a disappointing sequel to "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and many of the other performers may be charming, but can not elevate this one. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a wonderful life") is one of the remarkable children supporting Lassie; much later, he will grow up to marry "Dark Shadows" mesmerizing "Angelique" (Lara Parker).
