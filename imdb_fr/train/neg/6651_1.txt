It's really the worst film I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First of all, I will say that the acting has been very good and on the part of all the actors. <br /> <br /> apparently supposed to be very offbeat, and in this respect, he succeeded. In the same way, the story revolves around an egocentric aspirant, a chronic liar without talent and without intelligence, whose self-confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> It was worse than watching a car wreck.
