Okay, I've been a big Black fan for a long time and I was disgusted after watching this movie. Name the problems ... This film has a large part of the same crew as the first two. He was also called the PREQUEL at the original Black Stallion. Why can not they get the exact name of Shetan's mother or her color ?? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn that Sagr was Black's mother CHESTNUT and that in this film she is a gray mare named Jenny?!?!?!?!?!? WTF? And this is happening in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first was in the 1940s when the ship was shipwrecked. The timeline does not seem very fair to me. In addition, at the beginning of the film, there is a Frisian who is supposed to be Shetan's father ... on notice, it seems to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character left to make sure that this film seems to have any connection with the previous two. For some, it may be a family film but it's my biggest disappointment of the year.
