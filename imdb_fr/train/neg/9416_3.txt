Steve McQueen certainly has a lot of loyal fans. He was certainly a charismatic guy, one of the most charismatic people on the big screen. But even McQueen can not save this turkey from a film shot with what looks like a Brownie camera in the very places of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a newcomer without any criminal record in planning a bank robbery by one of the other gangs. There is more than a general indication that there is a gay relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He does not like other members of the group at all, mainly because of his lack of CV. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girlfriend to Molly McCarthy and she suspects something on foot, especially when he starts hanging out with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all rather crude characters. This would certainly raise my suspicions. <br /> <br /> The Great Bank robbery of St. Louis had two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim mainly made documentaries and Stix did not do much. One of these two jokers decided that Steve's performance was better served by making a bad imitation of Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This film could be considered the worst ever by Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed it for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they would have done it if they saw that. <br /> <br /> Or they would have seen something the public would have neglected except the turkey vinaigrette.
