Hello, can someone hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you are a spectator of this film: join the fan club! This movie was so incredibly bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must, it's bad in a nice way. Every clich√© ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very difficult to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of the worst movies ever made.
