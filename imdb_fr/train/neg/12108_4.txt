It was enough for me to write this double, but that's really the case. I like the gangster genre and it's the weakest entry I've seen in recent years. I have praise for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important, the script. It's a weak story about a little criminal. No amount of film acting or film black and white can compensate for a total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he's going to make another movie about the general. My advice is not to waste your time.
