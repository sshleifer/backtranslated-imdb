SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Performer: Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee and Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> The bad girl Melissa, short of 15 years a desert city and it does not take long before people around her start to die. The detective has to collect the clues with the help of his daughter Nancy Drew, played by Dana Kimmell, former student of the 13th Friday. Local Amerindians are the main suspects because they seem to upset city dwellers with prejudices. These events all lead to the murderer's revelation at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party. <br /> <br /> This below-average slasher is not so memorable. He has a sensation made for television, without a lot of points aside from the nerdy theme song of the title character who plays several times throughout. Lines like "the killer will turn us into cabbage salad." Fit in the standard eighties slasher scenarios. Marci calls Melissa a bad name, and then one way or another, they immediately develop a friendship. Apparently, Marci sees how difficult it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to apply makeup. This film would be hard to be made today, the main character being fifteen years old and the director inserting several free close-ups of her. The social commentary on the Indians has not been developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the high rating that this film gets. Bloody Birthday of Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt had the potential to capitalize on this honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage, but I feel unable to keep its promises. But on the positive side, the publication of obscure films like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.
