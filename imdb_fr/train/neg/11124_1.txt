In general, I do not worry much about violence in movies, philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is fine to me and the film brings us a lot of the above. There are beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature, a good decor of characters, a good direction. This film could be elected as a good movie. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and these two reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, violence is exerted on living beings to make this film. Not film violence, I'm talking about real violence. This violence alone could perhaps be justified otherwise, and that is reason number two; the film's message was not a mere introspection of the management's twisted relationships with women. Not that we do not all have real problems with women (respectively men). But the conclusion of the film ruins everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" is finally dying (if I remember correctly, I saw this movie years ago and it enraged me, now the guy came out with a new movie that I am certainly not going to watch) and is now even more clearly described as a kind of natural demon, the nature covering it, especially its sex .. Of course, it is the director who "kills" the heroine women. Women must die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. ** end spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, all that would be fine if the director had kept his vision of himself. But to use large images, artistic cruelty towards living beings, suffice it to say that men can be afraid of women and that men are cruel to women. It's just not enough. I knew that when I saw this film, it could attract good reviews for the "philosophical, oriental and artistic" approach and whatever approach was chosen. But for me, this film is totally destroyed.
