Not a woman's movie, but a movie for the gang. One of the worst films ever made by a director about women. Director Andy McKay just does not know the woman. Pics of bad taste, humor style of American Pie, raw history, meaningless, unfounded story, refuted characters. Vulgar fantasies appeared on the screen. Insulting and certainly not funny. I wonder how three good actresses have agreed to take part.
