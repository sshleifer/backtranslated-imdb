Alexandra, my 10 year old daughter, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring and I thought it was just a rehearsal of "101 Dalmatians" stuff. I could not wait for the movie to end. The best part was the credits at first - they were cute and well made. The rest of the movie is not worth seeing. Thank you.
