This film was so bad, obsolete and stupid that I had a hard time watching it all the way. I saw this guy from Rodney in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was funny, but that movie was bad. The "jokes" were not funny, the actors were not funny, nothing about it was even funny. Do not waste your time for that! Only positive things about it were the beautiful women :) and Molly Shannon who, I'm sure, did their best, but the scenario was too horrible. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
