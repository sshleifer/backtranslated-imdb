I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be good to ruin one of the best TV shows. Did we really need a re-make on the big screen? Did they ask the fans? I wonder what all fans would feel if they made a remake of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors such as Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, released all the music and made a drama. Do you think they would like that! This film does not have the same impression as the original. Of course, the original was sometimes a little tacky, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they were in trouble because they were always ready to get in trouble, and their main purpose was to help people who were going through the city . None of this mattered to the people who made this film, they might never have even seen the original series. My big question is: what will they ruin next?
