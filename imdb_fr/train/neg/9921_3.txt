The hippie past of Strummer was a revelation, but overall it was like crashing. Campfire stories work best around the privacy of a campfire. There were just too many anecdotes of semi-annoying old friends and too much archival footage. I love The Clash and Joe for not having gathered and sold their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document let me want to ... tell more. Using campfire storytellers without properly explaining who tells the story alienates the viewer to a certain extent. They should have been interviewed themselves. Even using Strummer's "radio DJ voice", the film did not stick. And can anyone explain all the flags floating behind the campfire scenes? After the impressive "Filth And The Fury", I was hoping Temple could deliver. A Joe Strummer doctor deserves better.
