I was delighted to see this film as a sequel to the cult classic "Private Lessons" that describes the dream of any teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I mention. It's just a regular soft-core cinemax movie that will not change your life. There is just a hot sex scene on a roof, but that's it. I watched it a long time ago, but believe me, it's just a regular and boring film. <br /> <br /> Women are exciting, but it's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to watch this only if it is broadcast by cable.
