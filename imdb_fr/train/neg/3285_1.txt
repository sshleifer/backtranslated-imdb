When a film like "The Dukes of Hazzard" earns over $ 75 million, he makes incredibly sad statements about the state of our society. Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from this type of problem, or I may not realize how many people will like this type of process effortlessly. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has no reason to think good movies since if it throws garbage then people will see it anyway because there is nothing else on the screen. That's it. I went out despite obtaining a free pass. The dialogue could not be more stupid. The cascades could not be more extravagant and scandalous. Maybe this "bigger than big" image is appealing to Texans, but I did not like it in any other theater. None of the "big names" was in this film ending a career, with the exception of Burt Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - do not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I would not even recommend this movie for video, even if you were desperate. It was about deceiving the public to make enough money after the opening day to be able to match or do better than it cost through marketing. They did it despite the public warned. Stupidity abound.
