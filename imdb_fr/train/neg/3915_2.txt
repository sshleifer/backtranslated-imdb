This film is not only poorly written and directed, but it is simply unpleasant. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the scenario, probably to streamline the schedule. But what results is simply confusing. The acting game can not possibly defeat the script that removes the motivations of the characters for their behavior. In addition, conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to Patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please please read the wonderful novel, in Spanish if possible. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. It would ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
