Burt Reynolds arrived at a point in his career where he seemed to be just moving up a gear. He introduced himself, was partying with his friends and was paying a heavy salary. It did not seem to him important that the product he represented was pure shit. <br /> <br /> No movie sums this up more than "Stroker Ace" which gives "Cannonball Run" the appearance of a classic and "Cannonball Run II" looks observable. Save for some racing scenes there is absolutely nothing to see here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson is so ashamed that a silly blonde is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If you think of Burt kissing him with Jim Nabors and dressing up like a chicken is funny, it's your movie. If not, choose almost any other movie comedy and it will not be worse.
