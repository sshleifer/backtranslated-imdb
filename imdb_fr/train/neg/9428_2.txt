Normally, I do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, but few movies will see. However, in this case, I feel that I must warn all those who might consider wasting time. I just watched the movie five minutes ago. It's just one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, the plot is non-existent and the production values ​​are at best the level of poverty. I know that a low-budget movie can be great, but not this one. Only one thing that could have saved this movie for the needs of all horror fans - no more gore on screen and slashing! The grand total of three times that happens is off screen. Although it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens - especially the final scene - there is simply not enough. The film is too long for minimalist content, too much dialogue and therefore almost impossible to watch. What happens? In short, three teenagers go out irresponsibly and consciously while driving in an isolated area where more than 20 girls have already been abducted and murdered. Of course, their car breaks down and they are taken to a boring old house inhabited by three crazy people, one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are finally murdered, one by one, off screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring and slow nonsense. As I said, murders are the only thing that needs to be monitored, even once. Please do not buy it or rent it just for that, and do not be fooled as I was by the misleading description of art and film. Save money and time
