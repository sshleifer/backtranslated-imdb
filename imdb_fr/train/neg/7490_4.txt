This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and dull. While Alec Baldwin was trying to portray himself as the perfect and fair prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film did not show any of the defense counsel and did not attempt to challenge the audience with a really constructive debate about how which a country be driven on such a terrible path. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody wants to defend the point of view of the Nazis, but it was the point of the slopes of Nuremberg! Four hours to just hit the Nazis .... go! This has already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should stay as Kim Bassinger's husband. <br /> <br /> Just after the end of the film, TNT screened the 1959 film, Trail at Nuremberg. This film is far superior.
