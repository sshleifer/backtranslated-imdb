I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in Algerian Berber territory, it was shot in the southern Tunisian desert, (completely different culture, I know that I am Tunisian and Algerian) The other shocking element is the character of her pet aunt, who speaks in the film with a very eloquent French, academic French, while the character she interprets was supposed to be of a disturbed person. has never left his mountain character. Bedouins with this kind of education, this context is impossible. The most scandalous and disrespectful scene, especially towards the inhabitants of the region, is the segment "famous woman" which is a pure invention on the part of the screenwriter / director. an Algerian society ever !!!
