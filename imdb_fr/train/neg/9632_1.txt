I have a terrible video tape of "Boom!" With pan-and-scan, and I want to see it in all its splendor. So I voted "1" and I hope you too. Together, we can shoot this movie in cinematic dross chasms and hope someone will see an opportunity for BIG MONEY to release "Boom!" in its Director's Cut Extended Version. The film is one of my favorite shouting - just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say, "Yeah, I guess you can fool some people for a very long time." producers considering the DVD release of "Boom!" It should be noted that wherever it was shown, there were many people in the theaters. But that has not yet been the case for Frost Falls.
