Matt Cordell is back from the dead for the third time, although I'm not sure anyone cares at this point, except for the raging fans of MANICA COP. Cordell, who died in the last film, is resurrected through voodoo. He is now on the trail of several villains involved in the murder of one of his officers. I missed part of this cupcake in the early 90s, but it was nice to see Cordell rack up the number of people in different ways. The problem is that the movie is basically static and that Cordell is just not Jason or Freddy. The interest fades away quickly, even with Robert Forster, the grand master of the B-movie, as a doctor who ends up brains in battle. Stay true to the first film in the series, both fun, scary and exciting.
