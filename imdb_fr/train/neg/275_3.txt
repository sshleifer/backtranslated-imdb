It is absolutely incredible to me that anyone can say that this film is not a preaching. It is not only an oppressive preaching, but also an absurdity, a spark, a dramatic shirt, and a painful overwork. Looking at him, one has the impression of being an 8 year old child punished for having to write "I will not become a fascist" on the board 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now, I understand that this was done at the height of World War II was supposed to be a courageous condemnation of Hitler and his terrible suffering (which everyone would applaud with all his heart) and I'm sure that exactly reflected the atmosphere of the day. But it is presented so immature and too obvious, it fails abysmally as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good shows here are those of Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a discreetly heroic anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson as a rich and fun grandmother with a funny behavior that gradually realizes how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless education has subjected them to all kinds of difficulties, children are ridiculously presented as robotic shears. They do not even look at a distance from real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here's a person of noble dimensions that I squeak every time she goes on screen. Every word, every gesture is meant to express how SUSTAINED and understandable the SACRIFICE that her husband is to do and the great cause for which he fights, that it should have been wired to receive a painful electric shock no trace of doubt or nuance in his portrait. <br /> <br /> So it's a very IMPORTANT movie, but not very good.
