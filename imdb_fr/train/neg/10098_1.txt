Not worth the video rental or the occasional time or effort. <br /> <br /> * Make-up that a child can do. * Play was over ... poor staging. * The editing was very unstable ... a lot of things made no sense or just seemed free. * The sound was badly doubled. * The music was highly inappropriate * The casting was extremely difficult ... had to be on the crack. * Zombies who speak without speaking ... drive, dance, work ... piss me off. * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap! As horribly built as he is ... he was the most beautiful zombie. Which does not say much. <br /> <br /> The cover sleeve was good but very disappointing ... just like the DVD's main menu ... great works of art and music. <br /> <br /> DON "T-SHIRT!
