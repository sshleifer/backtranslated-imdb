For shame, for ashamed that an actor as talented as Joseph Fiennes is allowed to embark on this nauseating film. The film was not only bad, but also horrible and without quality. The plot (was there one?) Seemed to be going nowhere. The Russians have played stupid games to kill or be killed and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for his pathetic executions. I abandoned about 3/4 of the way and turned it off. A "1" for ugly only because there is nothing less. Do not waste your time on this one, you will not miss anything.
