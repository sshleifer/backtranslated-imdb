I should have imagined that any film with the lady Poltergeist would not be good. It all starts well, but during the first murder scene, you discover that the movie you are watching is a film inside a movie. There are people sitting in a movie theater watching this movie. A girl in the audience is so annoying that I would have turned her around and strangled her. A little strange, but far from good.
