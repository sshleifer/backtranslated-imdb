** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A guy wearing a combination of Kong (the one used in KING KONG VS GODZILLA in 1962) gives a good part of the exploits of this monstrous film. Kong is resurrected on the island of Mondo and this time helps the lunkhead hero and other types well. The vampire-like villain is called Dr. Who ?? - funny, he does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally solves the problem with the pride and joy of Who, a giant robot looking like a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla. Like many Honda movies, it may have had merit before the American public got involved and added new images. The animation company Rankin / Bass played a role in this mess. They should have stayed with high quality kids programs like The Little Drummer Boy.
