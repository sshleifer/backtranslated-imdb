I go to UCSB and take classes with Executive Producer, Alison Anders. She is a superb teacher and director, so anything that bears her name must be good enough. This film, selected at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, seemed like a good choice. <br /> <br /> This film included beautiful shots and cinematography, but the lack of history and coherence prevented him from trying his luck. accomplish. My main problem was that it was someone's first movie and you could obviously know it. A bad acting and an even worse scenario prevented this film from taking off. The soundtrack contained good music that gave an idea of ​​the main characters struggling to cope with the sadness that had led him to leave and make the place where he had grown up. I just have to say that, despite the best of the film's craft, the lack of history and performance really kept it from being good.
