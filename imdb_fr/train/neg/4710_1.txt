My brother is in love with this show, let's get straight to the point. I totally agree with those who said it was a copy of Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents. <br /> <br /> I never really liked strange parents. Some things made me laugh, but most of the time it's downright boring and not cute at all. It's almost the same thing I feel about Johnny Test. Except that, NOTHING makes me laugh on this show. The gags are so stupid and useless, and to tell the truth, maybe it's just me, but the kids do not dress up like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is awesome, but God! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab, which was one of my favorite shows and I still do not mind watching them. What makes me disgusted and ashamed of Johnny Test who makes an absolute JOKE of this wonderful show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. The. Dog. Is. So. Boring. He is stronger and more odious than Johnny! And the gay accent? What is fudge! I hate the dog to death and I hope he will die, because it would be better for the kids to see and watch the odious shit that goes on this show and pick up a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want your eyes burn in miraculous flames and your brain is burned out of this show, do not look at it!
