Skippy of "Family Ties" plays Eddie, a twisted nerd of "metal" who gets flirted. When his favorite metal singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he goes out of his way to destroy all the posters hanging on the wall of his room. But when he later gets a new record that keeps the spirit of his dead idol of "metal". He is initially trapped in the ideas of revenge, but then he does not want to go as far as Sammi. Which is not really so far that his main victims seem only to go to the hospital. This film is totally laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as "Rock Star". OK, maybe a bit more than this junk, but you know what I mean. And how ALL can take root for a guy played by Skippy in "Family Ties", I have no idea. Gene Simmons' cameo is fine, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches consistency, I congratulate him for that, but otherwise skip this one. <br /> <br /> My note: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards becomes topless, an extra for a party at the pool
