It seems to me that some of the movies banned during the history of cinema were actually very important and very good films. I would like to argue that instead of banning difficult and controversial films, censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and mental health. If they did, one of the first films to be quickly concealed would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace". This film is awful with a capital "A". This is the worst film Burt Reynolds ever played in ... quite a feat for a man with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" on his resume! <br /> <br /> The story of extreme finesse introduces us to the famous stockcar racer Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He is stuck in a degrading contract with crooked developer Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract requires him to do humiliating promotional work for a new fast food chain, such as disguising himself as a giant chicken. Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's spirit buddy, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo whose brain is slightly smaller than a pea, are courted by Ace. <br /> <br /> Hal Needham, the director of this inferior trash bin, was previously a stuntman and he directed many films that drew on his expertise in performing spectacular stunts and pursuits / racing. car. Some of these films were acceptable, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace", he reached a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that you really pity the actors who play them. Anderson in particular is struggling with such a stupid role that he makes you cringe in despair. The humor is weak and childish everywhere, and the stunts and the sequences of races are not remarkable. Even the closing credits (found in all Reynolds-Needham collaborations) are usually not very funny, giving the impression that the movie might not have been a lot of fun. "Ace Stroker" is a stinker of considerable magnitude.
