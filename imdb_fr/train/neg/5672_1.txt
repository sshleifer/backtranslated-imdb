I am ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most important factor to own the DVD is the short film in the bonuses. My vote for this film is a big ZERO. Do not get me wrong, I'm a horror girl. but I want some meat behind the story, not to mention the fact that I prefer that evil befall humans, not be fooled to look, which seemed to be an eternity, animal tobacco clips Brutal acts interrupt a long silence and mediocre acts. If I had to make a comparison with another film, the only one that comes to my mind is Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, useless and a totally uncomfortable watch.
