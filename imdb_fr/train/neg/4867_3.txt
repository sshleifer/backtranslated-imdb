Just what we need! Another remake of the vintage Hollywood movie, with Eddie Murphy miscast again for the second time after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we lack special ideas to make a quality film, ladies and gentlemen! He has some signs of hope for his likable and charming image of animals that can act and talk with humans. Things can only get worse, unfortunately. The jokes in the bathroom and the sexual references instantly kill this piece of "family". Even parents and children saw the trailer on The Family Channel, which was followed by a deep anguish and disgust at the movies. Sad to say, this is the more progressive era of the millennium, but enjoy it as it lasts because things can only get worse over time. More went wrong with the brand new DR. DOLITTLE. It is absolutely without intrigue, feeling too flat. I also hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voiceovers than overpaid celebrities who do not want to go bankrupt. I will have to accept that my local newspaper ranks this film among the five worst films of 1998. The original version was not good either. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he's not paying attention!
