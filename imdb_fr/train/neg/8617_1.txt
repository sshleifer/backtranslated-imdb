After watching 10 minutes of this movie, I was puzzled, after watching for 30 minutes, my toes were bent - I just could not believe it: the movie is really awful. In fact, it's so horrible that I had to watch everything to be convinced (!). Meanwhile, I realized that it made me think of a group of so-called Danish comedies from the 60s and 70s. The schema is this: take an extremely popular comedian, create a scenario putting this comedian in so many situations grotesque as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners) and spice it up with a couple of beautiful girls - film that, and you're successful! I would not know if this film was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that has quietly died out (with some great comics), it seems that there is a market for this type of film in the United States.
