It is ironic that Mr. Seuss' fable highlighting the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most excited, commercialized and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's bane against Christmas comes from an early childhood incident and that the Who are themselves involved in the materialism of the season, with the exception of Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film is an ardent and ambitious attempt to capture the madness and sentiment of Seuss 'story, but the end result is a film that misleads and never overwrites the emotional weight of Chuck Jones' animated version. Jim Carrey is remarkable in his performance as a devilish Grinch, but whether it's dialogue, rhythm, or extravagant intrigue in the initial plot, the transformation from bitter advent to gleeful benefactor does not ignite. convincingly. There are some great visuals and the makeup is amazing, but beyond the technical triumphs, there is an element or two missing here. <br /> <br /> Succinctness? <br /> <br /> Soul? <BR /> <br /> Or maybe Jones has adapted the initial adaptation too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard misses in a three-hour movie. Howard, Carey and his team are all very competent and talented, but what seems like a winning combination is only weak and painful in his final product. If you have to see the long version, rent it on video with the animated version of Jones and you'll see how much bigger and brighter it is. I give this film three-in-five Who-Hash cans.
