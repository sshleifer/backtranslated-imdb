Must agree with the other reviewer It must be the worst movie, not to mention the western I've ever seen. A dreadful actor's act, an unimaginative and pathetic dialogue (even less completely inappropriate to be supposedly in the 1800s), and oh, have I already mentioned a battery pack prominently displayed at back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the boom to fall in the middle of a scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... completely awful. And yes, it contained all the clich√©s of the book, from the slow march on the empty and dusty road to the ridiculous "let's remember when", when a main character dies. Fortunately, I saw this on free TV. Do not waste your time.
