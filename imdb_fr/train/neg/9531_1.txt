It's an atrocious movie. Two demented young women seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give regarding a plot or a "spoiler". I would only like to say that the end is almost the most absurd part of the film. Much of the film involves Locke and Camp snapping odiously, while smiling psychologically at the camera. Add to that a soundtrack that is repeated over and over again, including a vaudeville song about "dear old dad" that suggests an incestuous quality that the viewer never really sees. The music is annoying at first, then ends up subjecting the viewer to a worse torture than the one shown on the screen. The theme here is animated youth, understandable as a reaction to the 60s, but with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
