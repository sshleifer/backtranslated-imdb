One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable "action" (it is clear that the cars are traveling slowly), atrocious scenario, terribly unsatisfactory end and incompetent direction make the film a hash. We know Judge Reinhold is an excellent actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension in the car and when the characters stumble on moments of hope, they laugh like unfair banshees for some reason, even "at five o'clock" when they see the bridge lowered! In addition, the chain of events that causes these people to share the same car is detrimental to credibility. Apparently, based on real events, though? If so, the truth is obviously stranger than fiction! Unfortunately, this has been described so ineptly.
