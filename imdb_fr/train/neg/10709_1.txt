I can not think much about this film. <br /> <br /> It was a horrible film ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to watch it. There were So few qualities that redeemed that I did not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot has gone from incredible to utterly absurd. My whole body was tense for the duration of the movie because I could not wait for this horrible thing to be over and done. At the end of the film, I felt relieved. <br /> <br /> The editing was mediocre, the actors play mediocre and the plot weak. Fran√ßoise Robinson was chosen as Native American, although she does not even look like someone of Native American descent. <br /> <br /> If a movie is as silly, it should be ridiculously stupid - at the very least. It was not. It was just pathetic.
