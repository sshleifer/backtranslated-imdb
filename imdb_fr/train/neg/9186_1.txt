Do you know the hilarity you feel when you watch a film that tries so hard to be a serious, thought provoking film that fails miserably? When can not you stop laughing, laughing at the awful nature of garbage on your screen? "House of the Dead" is struggling to reach even this level of low level cinema. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, "House of the Dead" manages to recreate the feeling that you have just woken up. that the cat put his curly things carefully on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the outset that actresses were chosen for their cleavage size (which they shamelessly exploit), while men for their uncontrollable attitude. Honestly, I did not care about any of the characters in the movie and I found myself wishing for their disappearance to spare me an hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered throwing two hours of footage from the game as a movie. At least we will have a better acting game ?? However, not all actors can be held responsible because it is difficult to produce a convincing film against the scenario of this film. This is probably the worst section of the film and actually contains phrases such as: "These are pure and simple zombies" and "No cap'n, do not go! It's bad!". <br /> <br /> We all know that zombie movies will never be particularly stimulating or meaningful; at best, it's two harmless hours of action, a bloody terror. Trash, yes, but fun trash. This is not the kind of garbage that springs out of your garbage bag when you carry it around the room and smothers your shoes in cartons of fermented milk and rotting banana peels. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received such criticism that no Danish cinema bought the film. If only we could have the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10.
