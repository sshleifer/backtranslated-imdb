WE FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> <br /> Stan 'n' Ollie mingles with some floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after having decided to go to a theater that burns in their absence! It goes without saying that their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused ... <br /> <br /> The good comedy of Leo McCarey laid the groundwork for the narrative framework of SONS OF THE DESERT (1934 ), William Seiter's masterpiece playing the victims of the circumstances, forced to tell a monstrous lie that turns dramatically. It's mostly very funny, especially the scene in which Stan is teased by Deslys, which leads to a violent back-and-forth game. However, Oakland and Flowers do not play the game at all, which gives them a completely different role, which adds an element of inconvenience to the "crampon husband" scenario. Originally published in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
