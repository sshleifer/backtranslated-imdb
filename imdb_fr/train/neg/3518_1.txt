I saw this movie with my climbing instructor and found it all so ridiculous to be ruthless. (For example, if Stallone is free to climb alone, there is no need to carry any material, but I suppose these carabiners look like a "mountain", let's throw them in). For lobotomized people who think that Colorado looks a lot like the Dolomites in Italy (where the film was shot), the Hollywood moguls have much more ridiculous and nauseating stuff to swallow.
