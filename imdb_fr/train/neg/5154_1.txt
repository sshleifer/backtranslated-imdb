It's the only movie I've ever released. bad actor-- bad plot-- bad casting-- bad director-- bad cinematography-- if they had undertaken to make a bad image, they could not have done a better job. I hope they are proud of his turkey. I am surprised that anyone associated with this movie has been rehired in Hollywood. Do not waste your time!
