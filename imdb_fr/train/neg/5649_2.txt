I do not think it's too bad show in the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not really lawyers. God forbid anyone to go to law school to watch these shows, which I heard when I watched a few interviews of the show. It made me a little gag. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the series, are the most boring. While this may be a compliment in some situations, it certainly is not here. Their constant harassment towards the women of the series is funny at first. But since that's what they do literally all the time, I realized it was as deep as the series would become. Trying to mix serious, dramatic and even heartbreaking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show did not compensate for the loss of interest that I felt more and more in trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's flamboyant and free public service announcements, in which he casts his opinions, do not impress. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the series for Crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit. <br /> <br /> I give two stars because there are times when I thought the series was trying to solve some contemporary problems. were made with care. <br /> <br /> I think that the authors of the series realized that the sexual harassment displayed by Denny and Alan was invasive, even for those who invited them more from the beginning. The fact is that I do not care if the treatment of sexual harassment in the series is well done, but I just thought that the writer insulted me by artificially implanting sexual jokes in the series in the hope that my libido me would continue. come back for more. I am no longer a teenager and I think this show is promising if its goal was not to answer the lowest common denominator for odds. <br /> <br /> Of course, I write this after realizing that it's really not going to get any better than that. It's a shame because it's one of those series I'd like to love.
