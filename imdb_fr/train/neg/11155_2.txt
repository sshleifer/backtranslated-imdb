The only reason I looked at it was because I found it at the library in my city (and I will scold them mercilessly for wasting public money), and despite the plethora of tits and buttocks, it was not long to understand that the fast forward button was my friend. Dreadful direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad to almost passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst scenarios I had the annoyance of seeing come true (as it was horribly crippled and mutilated) in a very long time. The best laughs actually come from the making "Making of ...", in which the poor sands involved in this messy HDV are trying to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something which will not be completely forgotten next week. Expect! Except for the fact that someone has attracted Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, of all people, by being a part of it, with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How did that happen, I'll never know, and to be honest, I do not really care. Look at your own risk and do not say you have not been warned. It's a pretentious movie shoot, the worst. I receive only 2 from me for having beautiful naked women, and hardly even.
