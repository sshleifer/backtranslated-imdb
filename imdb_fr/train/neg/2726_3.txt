Given his pedigree, this film should be much more enjoyable than it is. Even with a collection of quirky eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a film featuring Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The event as a whole is slow-paced, sad and, most often, witty. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts are not essentially comical, as she later confirmed in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was an excellent comedian, as he has shown with talent in films ranging from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think this disorder is better than anyone else. Except maybe the cat.
