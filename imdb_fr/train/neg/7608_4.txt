I admit that I do not expect much from a Roger Corman film. In general, I expect a lot of marches and bad scripts. Yet in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The Gunslinger tells the story of a woman (played by brave Beverly Garland) who assumes the role of sheriff after the brutal murder of her husband. Mrs. Garland is a very good shot herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. His first task is to close the local bar that breaks the municipal curfew. The owner of the bar tries to buy land in anticipation of his purchase by the railway (desired). However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plans and the legal advisor hires a man to kill her. <br /> <br /> Since Ms. Garland plays her role honestly and realistically, the temptation is total. to go to Suzanne Somers "She's the sheriff" jokes. With the exception of a couple of faux pas (the door of the apartment that opens from the inside, jeep tracks and two riders waiting on the screen to be caught off guard), the film becomes quite practicable. However, Corman did not resist the idea of ​​riding in his film, as in other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno claims that The Gunslinger is a horse opera that is worth it.
