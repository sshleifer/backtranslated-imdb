I can not understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap splashing, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors, do not look at it. Personally, I really hated the actors of this film, they seem to be hired directly from the street. The dialogues are completely flat and you always know what will follow. The overall quality of this film lacks a supposedly low budget. When we saw this film (myself and 3 other people), we all had in mind that this film was made by some people who had to do it, just to graduate in a film school - with the least effort possible. Another problem that really reduces the whole experience is the bad camera (very shaky) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recorded with only one microphone.
