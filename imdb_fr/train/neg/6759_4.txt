Another case of DVD worthy of the name betraying the quality of film in filming. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad. Rochon does a useful job and Damn! the casting is beautiful. I have never seen so many muscular guys come out together regularly. This movie really wanted to make you think that Rochon was the killer, but it did not have to be. My biggest problem with the movie was that in the end I did not care who the killer was, and the real killer did not make sense, since it was unannounced and the filmmakers thought ' Oh, bet you do not see him coming, miller! Yes, there were errors of continuity about (mainly with Ms. Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but for an independent slash, it's not that bad. At first, I was pretty sure it was a thinly veiled excuse for the girls to go topless, but it was just a gadget. The dialogue was overly thoughtful and sometimes painful. <br /> <br /> Do not expect this to be so, and it will not be so bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated.
