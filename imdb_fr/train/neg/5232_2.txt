Becky Harris plays the woman who was unlucky enough to be in the store at the wrong time and the only purpose of this movie is obviously to provide a reason to use remote controls! Miss Harris seems to be in her fifties or so when she first arrives. Once the red-haired thug has finished with her, it becomes obvious that she is not an AARP queen. If they are not some of the best assets ever displayed on celluloid, I want someone to tell me. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally used my VHS copy capturing its charms. I would like to know if this film is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is really not worthy of mention. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and smart, but I was disappointed on both counts. God bless Becky Harris!
