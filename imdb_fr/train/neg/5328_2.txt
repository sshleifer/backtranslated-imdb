Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with some excellent credits to her credit. I'm certainly glad she came back from this film that seems to have its admirers. I am not one of them. <br /> <br /> I've seen better acting in high school plays than in Smithereens. The plot as it is involved is young Susan Berman, ambitious in the world of music and ready to do anything to achieve it. She rejects even the sincere advances of a young artist living in his truck off the East River interpreted by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> The young Mr. Rijn contributes to the worst performance of the film. the worst interim jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder he's gone nowhere. <br /> <br /> I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is good for capturing the familiar places in East Village where the film was shot for the most part. But his work with his live artists was not up to par. I'm not sure she has so much raw material to work with. <br /> <br /> Look fast and you'll see a very young Christopher Noth in front of Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street hangman. <If you like punk rock, you can sit through it for the soundtrack. I'll stick to Bing Crosby.
