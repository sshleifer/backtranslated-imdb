Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) 16 year old Bo Derek looks handsome and undresses occasionally. She does a very good job playing with an immature and unsafe beauty, 16 years old, in fact <br /> <br /> 2) Many shots of a pretty Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> <1) Peter Hooten performs the worst performance of an actor since Brutus played Caeser's friend in "The Debates of the Roman Senate of March 15". He delivers each line in a delicious baritone bellows. Turn down the volume each time he speaks. Preferably to the end <br /> <br /> 2) The fantasies of Bo are unfortunately tamed, especially by today's standards. Some tricks in the bathtub and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is thinner than the costumes of Bo
