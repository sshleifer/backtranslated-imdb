I did my best to sit in that annoying mess, but I could not do it. Brad Dourif was absolutely nil as lead and all the secondary actors were only slightly worse. <br /> <br /> Everything is just ridiculous, from the terrible action to the ridiculous FX to the stupid plot. <br /> <br /> Loss of total time; does not bother you. The root canal therapy would be more enjoyable. Splinters of bamboo under the nails would be much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie on Uwe Boll would only be worse. Have the idea?
