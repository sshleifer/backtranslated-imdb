If this movie was a comedy, I would have given it a 10. Oh, where should I start? In simple terms, I've seen a lot of horror horror movies, but this one gives Troll 2 a horrifying look to save Private Ryan. It's as if a group of pornographic filmmakers decided to make a horror movie, changed their minds during production and decided to do a comedy, then came back into horror and then decided that they should have stick to porn (softcore). Everything in this film is simply horrible: the score (someone pulls on the creator of the Yamaha keyboard), the scenario, the staging, the cinematography, the acting. There are simply no words to describe that. Oh, wait, yes there is: Saint $ *%!
