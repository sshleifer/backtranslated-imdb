He only gets the third bill (behind Arthur Treacher and Virginia Field), but it's actually the main lead of David Niven and he's charming-silly like the dark Bertie Wooster of PG Wodehouse, the master (on his behalf only) of Jeeves, the most infallible valets. As an adaptation, it looks more like a diluted THE 39 STEPS than a real Wodehousian release. And too bad, the interaction between Treacher and Niven is not so far from the goal. Unfortunately, the mysterious tropes of "B" and forced comedy become boring, even after 57 minutes. The follow-up next year (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more disappointing, with no Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Forced to play.
