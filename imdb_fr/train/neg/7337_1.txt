Painful. Painful is the only word to describe this awful interpretation of a fun and interesting Shakespearean play. I gave him a shot but I was terribly disappointed and I could not even look at him to finish looking at him. For the person who wrote a novel about the wonder of this turn of Much Ado, I pity you and your bored brain. That your claims regarding young viewers be lifted without retribution. Please, do not bother with this heartbreaking and disgusting excuse for the performance of an acclaimed Shakespeare drama. You will have to induce vomiting and you will need a dresser near the television with which you choose to watch this shit because an involuntary defecation will take place.
