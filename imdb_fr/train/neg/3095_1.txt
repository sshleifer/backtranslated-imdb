Wow, I finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this dreadful film, only to learn that Rick Sloane and his production team have finished a video sequel this year. <br /> <br /> Of all the movies reviewed by MST3K - and they really dig from the bottom of the barrel, projecting the reputed bad "Manos", "Werewolf", "The Incredibly Strange" and the lesser known disasters like "Laserblast", "Zombie Nightmare," and "Time Chasers" - this must be the biggest pile of garbage ever (which makes it perfect for riffs). Very simple, the film is about a group of Munchies-shaped gremlins, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, feats and, of course, sex so as to end up killing people. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys fighting in the yard with garden tools), the writing is so forced ( as the scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of a girl who would have noticed, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time in the film that this happens), and history on ... we have rarely paid attention (hence the MST3K riff on a "coming law that films must be shot by filmmakers"), according to which he We must encourage the furry puppets to kill everyone on the screen. The worst film ... ever.
