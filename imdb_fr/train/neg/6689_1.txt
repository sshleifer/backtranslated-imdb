I can only assume that the other critics of this "film" are shareholders of the production company, because it was probably the worst film I've seen in the last five years. According to the opening plan of a rabbi who laughed uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered "level B". Before starting this movie, my wife and I were in a good mood and could not wait to see a fun popcorn movie. We knew we had not rented Citizen Kane and we did not expect to see the most incredible movie. However, after 40 minutes of suffering in the most painful trash I've ever seen, we're closing it instead of losing another minute of our life. <br /> <br /> If a "comedy" without laughter, drama, intrigue and annoying characters are your thing, then this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the sex scene of popcorn. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing a longer review of this picture because I have already lost an hour trying to find a joke. .
