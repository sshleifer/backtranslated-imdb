Another extremely unprofessional movie about programmers. <br /> <br /> The authors of this film do not really know the world of programmers. <br /> <br /> The 20 best programmers in the world, programs have your own satellites (for what?), program that uses the satellite frequency, someone kills someone to steal the codes (why?) and well more stupid moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> Peoples who are not programmers will see something terrible about this movie, because not professionals on this subject. But people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers will find this film strange and awful - because many moments in the film are NOT related to reality (why is the film not scifi?).
