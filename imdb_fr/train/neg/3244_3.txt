The effect in this story on a psychiatrist who engages with crooks is so manageable that I have to assume that it was the desired intention. The sets are artificial and at no time did I feel like watching a movie. It seemed that the actors were reading their lines rather than answering each other. While the film contains elements of old black film (except that it is in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Since the presentation did not appeal to me, I was expecting at least an engaging story. Usually I'm pretty slow with stories with twists, but you can see what would happen here in the first fifteen minutes. At the time of "Gee, I forgot the moment $ 80,000", I thought that this thing is really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist experienced in gambling addiction, behaving so stupidly is incredible. If at any point she behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have collapsed. <br /> <br /> This wooden production left me cold.
