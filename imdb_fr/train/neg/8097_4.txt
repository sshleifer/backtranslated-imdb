Considered by many critics as one of the biggest stink of all time (certainly the biggest of the career of the director Brian De Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a rich and smug boy whose life breaks in pieces when he and his mistress Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), reporting reporter, tells his story. <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it does not do much. It is undermined by incredibly disgusting one-dimensional characters that you would never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I could not finish it because it was not for my taste), but it's obvious for those who love the novel consider this film a true travesty. <br /> <br /> I never have so many talented actors strive to give an average movie a semblance of quality and fail. Such a waste. <br /> <br /> The problems start with giving Tom Hanks a nice guy in a role that is clearly supposed to be great for the UN. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Briton. Bruce Willis is bad, BADLY misinterpreted in the role. What was thought there? <br /> <br /> Alas, not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact, being forced to give a lame and burdensome lecture on "decency" after the climax. <Br/> <br /> This film ends up turning into an absurd joke. <br /> <br /> I liked the assemblage of talents; for that, I will give four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that a LOT of better film could have been made from the source material.
