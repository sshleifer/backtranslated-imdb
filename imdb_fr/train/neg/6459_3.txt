Such big players such a disappointment. Marlon Brando is playing and the character is horrible, the movie is not funny at all, a subconscious message can be seen "IT'S A CRAZY BAVAGE !!!", "THAT SUCHKS!" soon. It's just disgusting and tedious. Besides the stupid plot, the sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that it could cause epilepsy. Usually, I do not care about the decoration in the movie, but it comes from "Free Money" which made me angry. To avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer gets nothing! It is being watched at the expense of mental health.
