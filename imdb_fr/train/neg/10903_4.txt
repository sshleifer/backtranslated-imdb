Rob Schneider is a famous comedian who provoked his movements, his facials and his interpretations of "not the man". This time he is the animal. Marvin is a loser who tries to become a hero and one day no one receives a call from a man who is attacked. Marvin must take this case and save the attacked man. But on the road to crime, he gets injured with his car and is very damaged. He does not remember what's going on and the next day his life is not the same when he finds out he has an animal instinct. Of course, we have our wife that our main character is trying to reach but her trials are useless. It is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character is fate if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should discover how to become a normal human being again. By the way, her animal instincts help her in certain situations. Schneider's performance is poor. The movie is so unreal that it gets stupid at times, but it's one of those movies, so-called stupid fun as I wrote above. So look at it for the Rob Schneider monkey style, but it's certainly not one of the best comedies of all time nor one of the best movies in which Schneider appears. He is an excellent comedian, but it is not his best film.
