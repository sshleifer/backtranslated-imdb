I really wanted to love this movie, but a lot of it is stolen / borrowed from other works - some borrowings are painfully flagrant. The New York Times magazine pointed out that their singing frog reminiscent of Warner Brothers' famous cartoon ("Hello my baby, hello darling, hello my daughter to ragtime ...). But I challenge anyone to watch the animated film Fox / Blue Sky Robots (2005) and not find any ridiculous similarities in: storyline - A young inventor who grows up and an innovative company distributes all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - The household robot House Robinson has a design very similar to robots, and both films use a kind of retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> All of this seems to be in blatant contradiction to Disney's obnoxious quote in the end, implying that the company has been a constant innovator who never turns back also contradicts their entire catalog of movies in the 90s that were rather clones of each other, with some minor adjustments to plot and ethnicity). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers seem unable to let the story tell itself, and instead of constantly sending objects and noises flying in our direction, as </ p> <p> </ p <p> </ p> <p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> although we do not have time to watch for nothing less. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated, and it's a pleasure to watch. Much of the rest of the film seems to be reunited. Some landscapes look like computer-generated images from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a classic Mickey Mouse short film. At the end of this caricature, we are reminded that Disney has never had a great interest in innovating or telling good stories - they seem to think that just posting something on the big screen is enough proof of their virtue.
