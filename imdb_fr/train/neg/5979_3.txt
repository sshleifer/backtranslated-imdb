Pokemon 3 is a little over three or four episodes of the TV series, united without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, fight and resolution where all are happy at the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes of the plot are filled (on the closing credits!) Without explanation, and everything is a little too cute. <br /> <br /> Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. My two sons love Pokemon and, by showing an interest in what they love, we are closer. Watching a movie in a movie theater is always different than seeing it in a tube. My sons take full advantage of the filming experience. I gave a 4 to the film, mainly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
