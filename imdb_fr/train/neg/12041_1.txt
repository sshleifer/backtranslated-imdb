Well, had to start? This is by far one of the worst films I know. I will not comment on the story itself, it's a beautiful classic, but here, it's like being in a soap opera. For starters, the role, apart from Eric Bana, is the quality of the drama. I have always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor of The Bold and the Beautiful makes him ashamed. The action of the camera does not help either. As he waits when he thinks, it brings me back to Brooke Forrester's time in the lab! Peter O'Toole has either had very bad plastic surgery or is in desperate need of it. Anyway, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And finally, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she's definitely not Helen of Troy. Peterson should have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role, because Elizabeth Taylor would now be rather badly received.
