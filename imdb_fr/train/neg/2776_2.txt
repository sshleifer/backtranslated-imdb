The King Maker is a film about a series of real events (citation needed) that took place during the Portuguese occupation of Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and the artistic direction are laudable, the film still does not impress the viewer. . The acting game, in particular, was extremely poor. Some actors try to let the tears flow and the accents, real and fake, are extremely irritating. The script was too stupid and stupid to be true and more like a history lesson. The film could not even capture that royal, century-old look, and it looked more like a failed attempt to create an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Final say? Costumes and artistic direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the performance is extremely mediocre and the actors can not even emit natural emotions. In short, the movie sounded more like a script.
