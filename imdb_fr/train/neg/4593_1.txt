As a student in physics, I realized many idiots teachers and other so-called experts in the field. As I pursue my studies, I am learning more and more about the real physics experiences and about the people doing things right. <br /> <br /> Then my friends tell me about this "physics film" that they want to see. Not knowing anything about it, I am excited, hoping that the information will be well presented. <br /> <br /> I worked on REAL quantum mechanics; it was not that. <br /> <br /> This film begins with the basic premise that anything that touches a subatomic particle can and will happen to you if you just open your eyes. Let's think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are composed of about 10 ^ 30 subatomic particles. It's a billion billion billion particles! The more "mysterious" quantum effects of only two particles can have a 50% probability of being completely canceled out. As you add more and more particles to the mix, it becomes almost impossible to obtain a significant net quantum result. To tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, without any rationality behind it ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, also in physics, and I counted 3 facts during this film. But they were presented in the most misleading way I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not say as much for the neural part of the film because I have no medical training. It seemed to me that it might have been a little more truth, remembering my days in biology, but I can not say. <br /> <br /> At least this film had a redemptive quality: the dancing peptides (or they were actually) stage. In order not to spoil the invaluable plot that animates this film, the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all types of personalities "trained" by their peptides *, then the film goes to the dance floor, where we are spliced ​​between people who dance, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a fully CG scene filled with dancing peptides. The film, at that moment, was trying to tell us how much we are "addicted to emotions" and so we are entitled to the full song of this hit, "Addicted to Love". <br /> <br /> This scene redeemed, because everyone who could go through this scene and always take this film seriously ... well, you are the ones who need to "open your eyes".
