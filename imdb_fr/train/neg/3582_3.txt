No, it's not the horror movie ... This one is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a 1927 silent film featuring two boxers and the woman separating them. She loves the boxer says "One Round" Jack. She loves him until the champion arrives. Even if she marries One Round, she begins to flirt openly with the champion until the decisive boxing match between the One Round and the champion. She comes back to the corner of One Round, just as things seem darker, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the battle and win back his wife's love. <br /> <br /> This film was very early in Hitch's career, but time constraints should not make him a sustainable film. Although there are special film tricks and a bit of comedy, this film does not stand up to its later works. It must have been extremely risky for the shameless adulterous woman. This was perhaps the point of attraction of 1927. Looking at all these old movies, it is amazing how much I think they could be redone on the screen today and disappear. Maybe I should be that one .... <br /> <br /> Do not skip this movie unless you plan to watch all of Hitchcock's movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
