It's not a good movie. The acting is remarkably rigid and unconvincing. The film does not seem to know if it is a real horror approach or whether to go down the camp and the kitsch road. I have never seen the first film but it does not defend its merit, there are several unconvincing twists and the viewer is never informed of the importance of the main vampire. Not worth watching
