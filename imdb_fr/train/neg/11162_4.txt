Jack Black is a boring character. It's a boring indie film for 14 years. Do I have to write eight extra lines? Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to watch, like a Mexican nun This movie is the PG 13 version of an independent film. I really like movies that have the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores Mexican culture in depth. I'm just surprised at his cultural rudeness: Jack Black is so rude. A white man like Jack Black is not my most precious emissary in Mexican culture. The culture of the Mexican struggle is not the most diaphanous place a white man can look for, as I could look for it. presented here. <br /> <br /> I think IMB has changed my opinion. Has anyone else changed their minds as well? Just a question.
