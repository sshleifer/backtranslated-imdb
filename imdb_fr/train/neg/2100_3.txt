One would think that the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without having to invent things about it. However, this documentary seems to need to project everything in the most frightening possible light. He discusses the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions the almost fatal accident of Armstrong with the training vehicle, as if the coach and the spaceship had anything to do with each other. The problem of computer overload (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the last landing sequence looks like a disaster when it was simply an inconvenience and presented no risk to the crew. And it takes a "thirty seconds" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel before it runs out, when in reality it takes thirty seconds before an abortion is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or a dramatization of Apollo 11, opt for "From the Earth to the Moon" or one of the documentaries of PBS, but ignore this one.
