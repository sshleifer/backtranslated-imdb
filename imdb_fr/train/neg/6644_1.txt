Yes he is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to undress her actors and publicly show their underwear. Pintilie IS THE "Emperor" naked - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It's high time for someone to tell the truth. This imposter is a voyeur, a kid locked in the body of an old man. His abundance of nude scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It's a 100% visual perversion: it gets off the ground by having the actors undress and watch their willies. And if he does it in front of the public, he may even be aggressive! Did you know that on the set of "Niki Ardelean", he embarrassed poor Coca Bloss, saying, "Oh, Coke, how do I want to fuck you!"? She is a great lady, very honest and sensitive, and she has become incredibly ashamed - to her smallest satisfaction! And as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education of the Romanian public, many people are still so stupid to declare these visual obscenities of "works of art"! Will anyone ever have the decency to expose the truth?
