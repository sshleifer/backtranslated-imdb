This film, supposed to be a thriller, had about five sub-intrigues that developed simultaneously to reach the climax at the end, but it ended up becoming a yawn. <br /> <br /> The writing was banal, the rhythm was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring. George Clooney seems to need to enter a gym, Matt Damon hammered it and the others seemed to read their aftershocks on a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of this film is that it was carefully designed to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing about big business, oil and the Middle East . I have seen documentaries provide more excitement. Look at it only if there is absolutely nothing else to do.
