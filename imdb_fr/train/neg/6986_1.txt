I can not understand Al Pacino. I look at him in the godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I'm looking at one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see him in Two for the Money, Any Sunday and Revolution, and I wonder what the guy thinks. <br /> <br /> I came across Revolution a few nights ago and thought about investing the next two. hours on this. Here is a news flash: You want the prisoners to talk? Force them to watch this again and again ... they will confess anything. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to redo the plot, because there is no consistent plot, but it takes place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to involve but ends up doing it. Although he has no money, no education and dresses like a caveman, Natasha Kinski, a very hot woman, falls in love with him for no apparent reason, since they only have two minutes of dialogue to two. <br /> Frankly, If "Al Smith" had played in this movie, instead of "Al Pacino", it would have ruined their career. The scenario was horrible, but Pacino's unmotivated performance and obvious false accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was laughable. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but has about 5 lines in the movie. In fact, nobody speaks a lot in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most derisory premises of the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this supernatural talent that allows them to cross each other continuously on the battlefield. It's like the whole northeast is a Starbucks. "It's funny to see you here again on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... in a few months." <br /> <br /> I have to give this star to IMDb because there is nothing here for a negative score.
