Oh dear. Some of the best talent on British television have made this series, so I can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and that they had to be content with the first shots of many scenes. <br /> <br /> Some are scary. scenes from this highland mystery (mostly when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid to have found most of the story unintentionally funny! As the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand out there ... hmm it's a bit confusing. .. <br /> <For many years, fans of British cult television programs have campaigned for this series to be published on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
