Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, END OF THE WORLD is a particularly disappointing cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Here is the complete story: a scientist receives messages from space (Independence Day). The messages indicate that it will happen a massive disaster, then the scientist will later learn on the radio that a huge earthquake has just occurred in China. He begins to think that the messages have something to do with the catastrophes in the world, so he tries to determine who gets the messages (and who also sends messages in the space). He and his wife finally understand that the messages come from a convent. They visit him. Everything seems normal, including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages come and go at this convent. Then he and his wife secretly return to the convent where they are surprised to search by the extraterrestrials, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something he needs to return to his planet. Once the alien has recovered the special item, all the extraterrestrials are heading one by one to their home planet in some sort of looking looking carrier platform. Lee, being the last remaining alien, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some kind of alien decision. Lee enters the carrier and he is gone. The couple, watching the monitors showing footage of natural disaster records from around the world, decides to follow the extraterrestrials. Because the earth is doomed, the couple do not see the point of staying, it takes the carrier and disappears. The last shot of the film is a paper mache planet exploding. The end. <br /> <br /> That's all. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a dull movie in my life. This is the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. The scientist and his wife are two of the worst heroes or protagonists ever presented on the screen. They do not care about anything. They see terrestrial disasters on the screens and decide "what's going on, who needs the land anyway?" They do not even try to stop them or do anything to make things better. This kind of story might have worked if the movie had a sense of extreme destruction, but the action and the atmosphere were nonexistent. The actors and the people behind this dull film are on trial, to the point where you can almost feel when they hit their cards when they left and went back to work. I did not expect much from this film because it is a production of Charles Band, but I did not expect it to be such a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was already asked about his worst film and he mentioned INVASIONS STARSHIP. Well, I'm sorry Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was really fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly fun. THE END OF THE WORLD is MUCH, MUCH, worse: it's more dull and inert, with NO entertainment value.
