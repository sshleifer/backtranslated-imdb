When the movie started, the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue to California, I was wondering if I was mixing the tapes. Then I sighed with relief at seeing Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is watched by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about her behavior. She therefore hires him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could not do without the animal, the role-playing robot or the incest aspect. There is a good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it's not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My note: D +
