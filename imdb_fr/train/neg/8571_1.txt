Penn takes the time to develop his characters and we care almost. However, the story presents real problems, we do not see any real motivation for the bad brother's behavior, and the timeline is screwed up. Supposedly set in 1963, the music dates back to the late 60's or early 70's. References and dialogue are 70/80 years. The potential for a powerful climax arises, and Penn allows him to escape. But even with all these difficulties, it's worth watching, but not great.
