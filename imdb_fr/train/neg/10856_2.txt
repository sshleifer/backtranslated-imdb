Listen, I will not lie to you, but a friend only gave me this $ 3.99 film because it contained Danni Filth, the singer of the death metal band "Cradle Of Filth". Of course I expected violence and gore at its best, because that's what Filth can be described as, among a plot. <br /> <br /> But dear god, I got so wrong. This film bites seriously, high time. Being a low-budget film (haha, wait, do this ZERO BUDGET), this obviously lacks the beautiful musical scores of the Howard Stern Orchestra and special effects of Spielberg. No, it's a single camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> Take for example the case where our star and his violent demon, Mr. Filth, violently kills an aggressor. A fist in the throat and blood gushes, but oh my god, it looks like there is a bag of juice full of fake blood in the man's shirt. <br /> <br /> For you, fans of Cradle Of Filth: you will hear two songs throughout the film, but with the angles of shooting and the shooting of poor quality, they drag the general pleasure of the song down. <br /> <br /> My last comment: Stay away from the song. It's blood, blood, breasts and even a bad story. So, if you like dreadful violence, almost no voice (yes, there are almost no words in this movie), so buy it. But if you're not interested in bad quality movies, then avoid them. Do not waste your money.
