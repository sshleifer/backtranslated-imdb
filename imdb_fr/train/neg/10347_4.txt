I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and what struck me is that I think the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same age as the four boys in this movie. Warner Baxter, in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard, spoke of the same values ​​and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th President without the more turbulent aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all of Stoddard's sons serve during the First World War, even if the youngest loses only one eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what will happen if a woman minx mingle with this exclusively male focus and disrupts things? This is Susan Hayward's work here. In one of her prominent first roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amorous girl who marries a son, has an affair with another, and begins playing a play for the third. This is one of the precursors of the kind of role that earned him an Oscar later in I Want to Live. I suppose that with a model of decorum as powerful as that of Theodore Roosevelt and Warner Baxter, everyone is afraid to tell the father what is happening. The sons and also their housekeeper Ingrid Bergman. Here's where the plot gets a little ridiculous. Bergman is presented to us as a housekeeper hired by Baxter and his wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies and Baxter suffers financial setbacks. Bergman must be let go. She returns to France and a few years later, she returns to the family when the children are grown up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not believe the kids need a housekeeper now. Hayward is absolutely right when she confronts it that it was not the children who brought her back. In the normal course of events, Bergman would have continued his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous critics said that a quarter to a third of the film I had been released. This may explain our many holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Ingrid and Susan could not make another film together in the 50s when Hayward was up to it and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons. And I'm willing to believe there's still a lot of Ingrid on the floor of the cutting room.
