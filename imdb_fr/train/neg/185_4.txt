The five or three very good Westerns created by Mann are unrivaled as a whole in Hollywood. Even John Ford has never made so much with so much quality. The curious thing about them is their inequality. My Darling Clementine from Ford is worth about two and a half years. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero of them, besides Mann and Stewart, is Chase. Chase being responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote distant country, bend of the river, and probably some others. But none of them are as complete as My Darling Clementine, but very few Western and other films are. <br /> <br /> Each of Mann's five films has huge gaps, or is it six, let's see. Bend, Far, Western Man, Furies, Winchester 73, and yes, six, Naked Spur. Each has a beautiful scene after a beautiful scene, with some pretty glaring mistakes. However, the same goes for Red River, which remains the largest western ever made. So, perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the far country has huge holes. It's mawkish, and only really comes alive when Stewart and Mc Entire lock. The rest is quite pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a special course in cinematography. It's about the same eye as anyone hiding behind a filmstrip in motion. It's almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The far country has an extraordinary moment. And as usual, it comes from Stewart. No one in the history of cinema has ever received physical punishment with the authority of this man. He's absolutely incredible: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester and Man from Laramie: in Bend, he was beaten and holds such a credible thread and with such hatred that he looks like a displaced person from Dachau, at Far He is shot down on a raft with such violence, it looks so convincing that you squeak, and of course, when he's dragged through the fire in Man, well you end up looking for the marks of burn. Which actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester where he was beaten early in the hotel room, as well as anyone who has already done so. <br /> <br /> But it was Mann's territory: watch Gary Cooper fight with Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any battle scene ever recorded. Cooper, while not as convincing as Stewart, remains his equal, seeming exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, no one else has ever shown the human being in extremis as well as Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> See all the westerns he has made. These are his real monuments, even if all are soft. But then what. When he roars his big scenes, they are as good as anyone, including Ford. And his six westerns as a whole are the best ever made by anyone, point to point. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Anthony.
