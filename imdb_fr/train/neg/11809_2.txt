You bought this movie in the bargain basement of the Rogers Video store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie from time to time and thought it sounded like a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty clich√© "1970s" and is pretty groovy for that. Unfortunately, the scenario is hard to follow and not much is happening in the film. In fact, I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and I thought a week later that I should watch everything, no matter how slow. <br /> <br /> The film contains good spots, but you wait and wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you like B movies, this might be just for you, just know that the movie is slow and not much is happening really, and did I mention a lot of history either .. . <br /> <br />
