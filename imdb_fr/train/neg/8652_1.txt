Before I started with this movie, I thought maybe it was a good movie, but when I started with this movie, I found it really horrible. They said the film is shot in Afghanistan but I think 95% of the film is shot in India. you can see cars made in India. you can see lars drinking bisleri (an Indian brand of water), Hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * hahah * it's really funny and many other things that prove that nothing has been shot in Afghanistan. I think we should not waste time watching this movie .. a waste of time .. I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or maybe the heart is a better idea but do not look not this waste of time
