I saw this movie with Indian friends on Christmas day. The quick summary of this film is to be avoided. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film, but did not work well. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's 1999 attempt to capture part of the disputed Kashmir region from India. Supposedly based on facts, this film reveals that the Indian army struggled to regain control of the region by the Pakistani troops, who occupied the heights. But instead of telling what must have been a fascinating and heroic story, this film only gives the Indian army a laughable and stupid air, which, I know, is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched this almost completely Indian public movie, which was very patriotic and clearly wanted to love this movie, but also laughing in scenes that were not meant to be funny. . <br /> <br /> The scenario was absolutely catastrophic. This gave the impression that Mr. Dutta knew nothing about the functioning of an army and used bad war films as a reference. The result is a brainless and repetitive scenario. <br /> <br /> The action of most directors is not stellar, but given the scenario that was given to them, I have a hard time criticizing them too much. As for the secondary actors, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs. <br /> <br /> The editing was also rather bad. It was pretty hard to follow what was going on most of the time, and the music would end abruptly with scene changes. <br /> <br /> Good things: the cinematography was good, even if it was slightly injured. the fact that the film does not seem to be corrected in color (the color balance often varies significantly within the scenes). In addition, the few songs in the movie were quite enjoyable - at least for the first half-dozen verses. Unfortunately, they went much longer than they should have. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This disorder is FOUR HOURS. There is enough for a good editor can almost shoot a good film of 1.5 to 2 hours of what has been shot. Unfortunately, a good publisher did not work on this movie.
