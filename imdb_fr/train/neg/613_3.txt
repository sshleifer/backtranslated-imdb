Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's an ugly shit. I'm surprised he received such a high rating. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: What's wrong with this movie? <br /> <br /> The story itself is just crap and clich√©s. Here's pretty much what it's all about ... A kid who's a little nerdy without a friend gets caught, gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge. "Everything" is packed in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time watching it. Plus, the second one is not much better, so do not worry about watching it either ... I rated this movie as a 3 because I liked holding the scarecrow, not because the movie was good. I think you have the picture.
