The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantastic films. They have always been willing to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never had the money to succeed in producing convincing special effects. This film, released in France under the title The invaders of space, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures ranging from giant octopus to giant lobster trying to gain the upper hand over humans. It is extremely clumsy and laughable, but also very nice. After all, we love these creatures and movies after all, are not they?
