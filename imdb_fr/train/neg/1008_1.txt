The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the whole movie. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every sentence he uttered during the movie. He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. team. <br /> <br /> Whether it's an emotional scene, an action scene or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this movie. Do not even worry about downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you're reading this, stick to the music. Even if you're not good at it, you've done a great job of encouraging people to think you can sing.
