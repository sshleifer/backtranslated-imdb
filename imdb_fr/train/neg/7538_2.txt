I watched this film because I like Nicolas Cage well, I found it strange and totally useless ... so I decided to dig a little and get my hands on the copy of the 70s. Sensational. What a difference. The original was much better. I would like you all to know that she originally made a statement that her existence had a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing its fear of paganism. If you go into the subject, he also comments on life, but I do not want to go into detail, but simply, if you were disappointed and want to know what it should look like, do not hesitate to look the version of the 70s, a little dated, but much better.
