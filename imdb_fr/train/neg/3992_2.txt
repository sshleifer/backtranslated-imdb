Director Spike Lee is known for her films on racism. In many movies, such as "Do The Right Thing," most whites are all brutal racists. In this film, interracial marriage is the subject, racism being the complete issue again. <br /> <br /> What Lee does, however, is once again proof of his integrity against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the world of cinema. If Lee or someone else made that kind of bias against another group, he would be vilified, but Christians? It's "opening" on them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots her son, then puts the smoldering rifle over his Bible. They zoom in for another close-up in case you missed it. Hey, guys, here's another Bible reader and see what he looks like! Lee does this kind of thing in almost all his films. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hatred of interracial relations. Who could argue by describing racism as a perverse thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards the whites does not help the situation. This only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hi, Spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "overcome yourself". <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the subject could have given rise to a stimulating film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.
