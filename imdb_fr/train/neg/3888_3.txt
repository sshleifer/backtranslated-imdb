I started to melt and I will make this review as short and pleasant as possible. <br /> <br /> There is this astronaut, and he gets into a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they come back ... well, it does not matter what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut has started to melt! No, not just burn, but melt! Like an ice cream cone in July! Okay, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it becomes all red and gooey, and the fact that it is melting makes it really crazy. I suppose he also looked at the manual of "the man who melts" because he suddenly knows that in order not to melt completely, he has to eat human flesh, so he begins to tear people up. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in a film where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important is the WHO that will follow and WHAT will they stay? How long will it take to completely disappear? WHY was this film shot? Where did they get the money? WHEN will you fall asleep watching him? <br /> <br /> I almost melted, but I still have enough time to tell you that this movie is terribly boring, even if the idea is really cool and nice of crude. The makeup is neat but everything else is ... SPLAT
