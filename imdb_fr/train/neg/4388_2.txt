Oh man, I know what you think: "With a title like that, I can not go wrong!" Uh yes you can. Me too, I liked the title, but I hated the stupid kid who played "Satan's little assistant". I also hated mother, sister / daughter and boyfriend - I hated all those people! Dude, it was sometimes an agony to watch that! The only reason he does not get 1/10 is because, despite the low budget, they did it well. But oh man, I hated these actors, so stupid! I knew it was going to be bad, I guess they saved a lot of money by simply using halloween masks for the killer, and Jesus' suit in the end was really stupid too. Oh agony, do not look!
