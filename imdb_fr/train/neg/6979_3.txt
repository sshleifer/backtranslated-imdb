I also watched this movie, and although it was very well done, I found it heartbreaking and I would not recommend it to women who have young children. The terror on her mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is really heartbreaking. And what's sad is that she dies internally. Finally, she returns to the Applacian Mountains. All the money she earns by making dolls does not hide the sorrow she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulled money out of her clothes trying to heal her child. I'm surprised this movie is happening in Detroit, because when I looked at it, I thought people were coming to Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also a route for the poor of the mountains.
