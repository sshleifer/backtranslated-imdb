I do not know why I'm commenting on this stupid reality TV show that led me to watch a couple of episodes of (a television broadcast of the cable marathon that aired 5 episodes in a row or something, but I did not not all watched, like three episodes) when I was nine months pregnant and about to start childbirth from one day to the next. Maybe I'm bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, that's what I really do. money and celebrity, she seems to have very little sense of dignity. Or she is egocentric to the extreme. him, where she pushes a camcorder where she wants it, no matter if it is in front of someone's face or in the shower, Federline standing there. She babble about her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination, I do not care about my role, but I can not help but wonder how she feels about it now that she is divorced. And yes, for her I am embarrassed But I should not be. She seems to live a pretty empty, shallow life though. I do not want to exchange lives with her, even if I could. Kill the TV if you want.
