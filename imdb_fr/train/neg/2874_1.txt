This film begins terribly badly with a woman tied and tortured psychologically. There is complete male frontal nudity, parts of dead animals, dogs licking nipples, the female loses control of her bladder. All shot in a cold gray color. Effective, but a little too much. We then go on to see the youth of the murderer BTK as well as the present and his history of crimes. The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the murderer who enters the homes of his victims and speaks to them last long enough and are frightening. Here we do not see fancy pictures or good pictures, it feels like being filmed with your camera at home. It does not look horrible, but seeing a criminal engage his victims for a while before killing them is rather unusual and scary. What this movie does not have is a drama, really. There are scenes of cops from time to time, but there is no excitement to find the killer. There is not much bow to this story. It could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real slaughterhouse images. It is scattered throughout the film and comes suddenly again and again. Sometimes you do not know it happens and you do not have time to look away. And that I must reject. I am all for low budget horror movies but I do not tolerate the suffering of animals. It was useless, excessive, and comes without warning. I'm glad Lionsgate publishes stuff that no one else does, but they should have passed on this film or edited the animal gore. Stay away from this garbage.
