I saw this movie once and thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said to me: "Look at it again, it's better". So I did. And to my surprise, it was worse the second time! There is a word limit, so I will start the ball here. <br /> <br /> - The bombing scenes were all so stupid. Why the hell would someone wait to trigger the explosion ??? -No of the characters here is even friendly from a distance. Not the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and the last time I checked, a car does not burst from a single shot, nor a fire THAT can not be extinguished small fire extinguisher ... did the 3/10 viewers above watch the movie ??? -The camera is so fragile that I can barely tell what's going on. This opening scene with the robot was upset, the rest of the movie was not much better. <br /> <br /> - The scene of the sniper. The McManus brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") rolled their eyes, it was so stupid. First, why did the guy install his weapon where a person had been hit? In addition, why would he spend so much time cleaning bullets, reloading, aiming, and NOT being shot at, when there was so much chaos around him? -SAS tape RUNNING instead of staying and fighting ?????? Hey ????? Are the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I did not want to sound homophobic, but honestly, this scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Too long for its own good, but too short for the amount of material it contains. Bigelow seems to think that the more action there is, the better. It looks like she's wrong - the movie is full of unnecessary action scenes to distract you from the lack of a central storyline. I know that Watchmen is longer at 163 minutes, but at least this movie did not drag. On the other hand, this film seems to be longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was at best satisfied. But do yourself a favor, skip this and do not give in to the hype.
