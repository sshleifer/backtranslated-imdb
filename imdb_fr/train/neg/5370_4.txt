Råzone is a horrible movie! It's so simple. It seems like they tried to make a movie to show real life. Just as Zappa did several years ago. Unfortunately, Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon is still the little girl of "krummernes Jul" and Laura is just not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the film she plays with soul and that destroys the film! <br /> <br /> Even if I consider it a movie you should see. I do not agree that young people behave this way, but I think it can show how it can end if you drop your child. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies such as "Film Folket"! <br /> <br /> All in all, I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a good movie, but because it's a movie about important themes. I also think it's important to point out that there are violent scenes, and in fact it's in those scenes that Laura does the best. - as the end where she holds the gun!
