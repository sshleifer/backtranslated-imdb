I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst film I've ever seen, because it has had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen never seen. Not once, a plot device came up without my guessing more than 10 minutes in advance. The film had no subtlety in the movie, no obvious intelligence behind the scenes. The intention of each spoken or typed line was so obvious that it was impossible to "penetrate" into the film. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the horribly invented intrigue and failed attempts to win back the audience, much more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.
