Right on target: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most insignificant, unclevery and downright horrible movies. This "comedy" is so empty of anything remotely resembling a trace of mind that it is almost incomprehensible that it was even made. I said almost because there are fans of everything, after all. <br /> <br /> This film is not even "good", bad or "nice", bad. Putting this film on the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Monster Robot" would be a crime for these films. You can actually watch movies like that and get in on it. But this film is so bad, so badly done, interpreted and scripted, and so incredible, that there is no trace of "camp" or "schlock". <br /> <br /> Although this was done before the premiere of Saturday Night Live, comparisons were probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than the worst SNL sketch you can find. And man, it's BAD. Just to stop the audience from leaving, Shapiro throws a pair of breasts from time to time, but the badly filmed breasts of 1974 will not excite anyone. Honestly, this film is so mediocre and constitutes an excursion that causes sleep. I doubt they excited anyone in 1974. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro shot this movie. I swear to God that any ten-year-old with a video camera could have made something more funny and intelligent. It's just unreal - it's really an incredible movie. "Jokes" and "gags" are so childish that even little boys who like to take out Daddy's porn magazines at night will not laugh. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie one thing - the very latest sequence, the "dancing man" sequence, where a guy (Shapiro) in the streets of New York dances on a tune, is easily the best thing in this horrible movie. The sequence of "dancing man" is not so great either - it certainly has its moment of lack of intelligence while Shapiro desperately trying to take the time of the entire song - but it was actually a little observable. The part of this sequence where the cop begins to dance with the man is the only trace of intelligence in the whole film. No wonder Shapiro puts this sequence last - again, even if it is not so big itself, it easily beats everything in this "movie". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie is such a complete shit that it's about how a human being can be so cleverly without intelligence. The name of this film should have been "Ken Shapiro's Craparama". It's amazing, but a lot of really talented filmmakers can not enter. However, I will say that I bet the geniuses of NYU will love this movie. Total garbage.
