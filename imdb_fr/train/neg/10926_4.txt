Although the idea is more original than most science fiction movies, the performance is, as usual, absent. Although the practical effects for mummies are not bad, and the character "Gun Nut" is in the foreground, the only real attraction is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin together on a small screen. I suspect it was the idea from the beginning. They do their best with what they have, but the "must-see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena's character was wearing Tomb Raider style shorts. I do not know the cinema of high level but I can not deny the true beauty when we see it !!! And Adam Baldwin sees again the guy you like to hate. If you just want to watch some of your favorite Firefly characters have a good time with some sub-par material, maybe that's for you. If you want a good acting and the development of your character, do not hesitate to look elsewhere
