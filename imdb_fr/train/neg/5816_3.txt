From the acclaimed review, I was expecting more from this movie and Tamara Jenkins. The story unfolded and did not seem to have a purpose or a plot. And I can not believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) would be so blamed for not losing her virginity anymore. Maybe I'm too young to tell (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no connection problem with Shakespeare's stories in Love or Life is Beautiful and I was not alive in those contexts. The distribution is very good but unfortunately for them, the scenario did not allow them to involve the public. Overall, Slums had its highlights, but unless you want to remember halter socks and tops, I'd say you have to ignore this one.
