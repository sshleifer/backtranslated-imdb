I only watched the first 30 minutes of this movie and what I saw is total shit. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times worse. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director of all time, but that's not true. The idiot who directed this junk is the director VERY never. <br /> <br /> The American cop has a German accent! The "police station" was an office in a warehouse with a sign "Commissariat" hanging on the wall. There is a fight with punches where the punches are clearly missing about TEN PIEDS. <br /> <br /> The cop stops the women, handcuffs them and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his partner cop to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse with a gym bag. The policeman's partner may think that something is wrong, that his partner may be a bad policeman who is murdering these women, but he does not know if that's what's happening because - he's a moron ! The dialogue is totally stupid, the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest way I've ever seen on the screen. It is quite obvious to the police officer's partner that he is illegally abducting these women. He slaps them to take them to a warehouse and brings them back to the car with a gym bag in which a body is. Yet, the partner who is there all along, does not know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this film is a total piracy. I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I could not take it anymore. It must be one of the worst movies I have ever started watching and I will not waste any more time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely worthless.
