I think it would have been a much better movie if the Cajuns had been described in a more credible way. My family is from southeastern Louisiana and I live in southeastern Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard the people I grew up talking to like those. The Cajuns have been described as rednecks back. Most of the Cajuns I know are well educated, proud people and do not feel like they are not educated at all when they talk like these. All in all, it was a decent movie, with great scenery and music. I understand that the writers come from Lake Charles and have knowledge of the area, but for the sake of all that is Cajun, ask the actors to study the language, to live among the people you describe and to better understand they are before you try to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it's a much more enjoyable movie!
