What seemed to be a good premise for a movie ... unfortunately, it fails to deliver at almost every level. Very difficult to follow at the beginning of the film, I found myself fighting against the desire to disable it. The biggest problem from a visual point of view is that the work of the camera is simply excessive, with so many collages and half-images "arty". subliminal cuts throughout the movie that really distracts you from the overall story. He's really trying too hard to immerse you in the moment and reach a moving end, but the movie has so many half-designed characters and irrelevant scripts that it only leaves you feeling disappointed and confused about the reason they tried to go so deeply with. .
