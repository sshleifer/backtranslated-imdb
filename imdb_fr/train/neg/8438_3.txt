I guess bad Laurel and Hardy are better than not Laurel and Hardy at all, but hardly. It's unfortunate that Fox's movies are the ones that come out on DVD, exposing those who may not be too familiar with L & H in their worst film rather than their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again, boys get fucked. with a silly romantic plot about a guy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with the boss's daughter, who hates him and prefers a clever guy. It's amazing to think that Fox's geniuses think that's what L & H needed in their movies. <br /> <br /> Without their pancake makeup, the boys look tired and old. The only scene that works for them in this picture is the one where they try to sneak through the window of a room at night and the rather strange scene where Robert Mitchum, a classic black villain, tries to sell "insurance" to Oliver Hardy with Stan. <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
