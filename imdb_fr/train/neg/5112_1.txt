Awwww .... yes, it's warm to the heart and all that an unlucky family is embracing in ABC / Sears and their home is "renovated". This is where the humanist call ends. I liked it at the beginning of his tour, but now, this show has become excessively disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of treats for each family on which every episode of the series will be presented. People at Habitat for Humanity must shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a 16 year old boy to have a hot tub in his bedroom or to get fucked in his bed with the "Low Rider" hydraulics? Does the mother really need her rundown, rundown and rusty old pickup truck to be restored and "whistled" by some of California's best designers? A new guy would have done the job very well, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a 60-inch plasma screen in every room of the house? And then there is the question of who pays the property taxes and the higher utility bills. Even after the zaniacs leave "Makeover", someone still has to make a living. I doubt that the friendly social service employees see the humor in all these largesse. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than an attack card for ABC and a tacit advertising for its sponsors.
