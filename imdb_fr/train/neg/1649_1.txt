Every Sunday, a trio of heads gather in a New York restaurant to brag about his sexual conquests of the night before. Sometimes they are joined by an ex-comrade and newly married hoochie hunter who is hanging on to them as a baron. They are hornless corn dogs, and Mia, who watches them on the lookout, decides to give them a lesson, damn it. Ergo, she'll go out and dump - why not? All three! <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a crazy idea. What a radical and naughty girl. Women now have the right to go out and sleep as much as they want. As much as men, even! <br /> <br /> There is one ludicrous element isolated in "Whipped" - namely the fact that not once, during the detailed discussions of the amigo on his bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they taunt, the other guests in the dining room would turn around and say, "Dude, we are trying to eat here." Indeed, a he-hey gag has an elderly lady weighing eagerly on the useful sexual properties of certain drinks. A big fat Kermit frog "Sheesh" at that. <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that a boyfriend movie with a gorgeous frame, a smart and cute heroine and three possible couples had such an end. . <br /> <br /> PS - 30 "whip-oosh" sound effects to the writer for the use of the phrase "You go, my daughter". He was tired in 2000 and now. <br /> <br /> Save time and watch reruns of "Sex and the City" ...
