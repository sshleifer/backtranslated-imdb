This is only related to the first movie of the name. The plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks !!! I have no idea what they were thinking about, but this movie is so bad. Avoid that at all costs, the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher movie. It's the same for the fourth but this one and the third are worthless !!
