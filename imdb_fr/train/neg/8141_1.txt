Watching it live at night makes you wonder, just who in the world has lit up this shit. A newlywed couple speleology honeymoon, is attacked by bats and the husband begins to run in pajamas to attack various people. And where are they exactly? They are in the desert, then they ski, then they are in a small town that looks like mountains nearby. The city is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and organizes a personal vendetta against a plaintive doctor. The ski hospital is run by a really cool guy with a nice thick mustache and his wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension and the end will leave you filled with anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston made the effects for this film. I guess you have to start somewhere.
