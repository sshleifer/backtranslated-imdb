"The vampire bat" is certainly an interest, being one of the first genre horror movies of the 1930s, but taken in isolation, everything is a bit too crisp for a sincere eulogy. <br /> The film is set in a European village in the 19th century, where a series of murders are attributed to vampirism by the suspicious inhabitants. James Whale's Frankenstein is very similar to Frankenstein's, which is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill's character, Dr. Niemann, along with his misconceptions about scientific progress. <br /> <br /> The vampire theme is arbitrary and unique. used as a red herring by suspending his suspicion on Herman the little simpleton, Herman (Dwight Frye), who likes bats, thus offering a pretext to a crowd wielding the torch to unleash the unleashing - as if it needed. This is one of the first three horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray are co-stars (also "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum") and, like their other collaborations, the film suffers from comic relief malfeasance and a tendency to come out of the horror to incorporate thriller elements. However, taken in context, "The vampire bat" is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> All we have left is an imitation of Frankenstein of poor quality, the vampire elements being purely a tool to deceive the fans of Dracula. But for the title, the film would be hard to be considered a horror and it should be noted that the director Frank Strayer shot the movies "Blondie" a few years later.
