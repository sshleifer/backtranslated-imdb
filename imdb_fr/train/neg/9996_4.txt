Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are undeniable improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": commercial and smooth commercial waste submerging (this time literally) a decent distribution. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner who is being hijacked by art thieves and crashing into the sea (all the commercials claim he was close to the Bermuda Triangle, but the film itself makes no mention of it). When the rescue ships come to lift the plane out of the water, we see all their cranes fall (rather blindly) into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (imagine the cranes blocking the plane, the passengers and the scenario saturated with water). NBC used to broadcast what appeared to be the "director's cut", with at least an hour of additional footage - mainly flashbacks - injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of an episode of "Gilligan's Island". The most exciting time is the plane crash and some players have a little fun: Lee Grant is a heinous drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, an irreproachable stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland flirt with old. Nevertheless, unsustainable personality conflicts and military details end up tearing up patience. ** from ****
