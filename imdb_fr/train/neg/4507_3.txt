Despite a nice overall scenario and expensive production, one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and the cultural consultants? Not on pay apparently. <br /> <br /> One of my Japanese friends actually laughed with laughter at the cultural absurdities she saw in front of her eyes. In a later conversation, she said: "Imagine a Finnish filmmaker making a film in Finnish on the American Civil War, using blond Swedish actors as an army and French as Confederate, missing the hoop and wearing a 1950s hairstyle. -being some people in Finland might not realize that the skirt of the hoop "missed the hoop" or recognize the weird hair of Jane Mansfield, but in Atlanta, they did not believe it ... and laugh in the fairways ... a story and excellent photographs. <br /> <br /> So ... watching Memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone who knew the Japanese cultural nuances, the real geisha or the Japanese dress, and Hollywood is amazing in his myopic vision of filmmaking, they often do the most expensive things while leaving the details that really polish a movie refinement of a movie. I thought that "The Last Samurai" was the crowning achievement of an otherwise good movie about Japan. The memories of a Geisha are embarrassing better and worse at the same time.
