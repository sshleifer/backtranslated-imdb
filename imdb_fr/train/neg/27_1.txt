Terrible film. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just filling. The movie was bad. Why I must develop on what I do not know. It's already a waste of time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting is nil and the writing is just stupid. Bad in every way. The only good thing about the movie is Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined by a terrible and useless rape scene. The film is a badly conceived junk and totally incredible. <br /> <br /> OK, I'm going to make fun of IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text. First, I'm wasting my time watching these offal. So I feel compelled to warn others that I'm creating an account with IMDb, but I find out that I have to write an essay on the film to express how bad I think it is. Totally useless.
