I probably saw the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack for the first time so expensive that the 1983 adaptation is really disappointing. I did not have any chemistry between the 2 main stars. Many actors and theatrical actors just do not do it for me, and that's all that makes Tim play the role of Rochester. Did the casting director ever read the book? Very strange! He's a good actor, but Mr. Rochester certainly is not! And Zelah was just, well, strange, a little matching couple. In his favor, the support cast was pretty good and Lowood's scenes were for me the best of the adaptation, but overall they did not capture any of the magical properties of the novel. I certainly would not ask anyone to look at it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real disappointment!
