This film proves that "commercial" cinema or Hollywood films are going through a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason for this film to have been produced, other than the fact that someone was hoping for a hit based on Shaquille's name. It is worthwhile to refer to the plot: it is a little more perplexed than a node. What else? The screen is a little dark, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Note: 1 / ten.
