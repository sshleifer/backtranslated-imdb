The idea of ​​the story behind LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately, the story gets a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of archival footage as well as mediocre special effects plunge this movie to the level inferior. /> <br /> The film begins with a missile heading for the Earth. Panicking because he is about to hit the Earth, the Soviets manage to divert the object. This is not necessarily good, however, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words, with each passage made, it follows a band of death that may kill us all! It is therefore up to the good American scientists (led by a very young and barely recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan their rescue - and above all to save New York from its immediate flight path! Unfortunately, they are not able to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can not say if it's a big loss), but thanks to the good old American know-how, they are finally able to destroy this annunciator of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea of ​​history is neither bad nor original. But so many old clips of fighter jets and guys with radar telescopes are getting old a bit and it was like it was padding. Overall, a decent but uninspired film that extreme fans of the genre can love - everyone else sees it at their own risk.
