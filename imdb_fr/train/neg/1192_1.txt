i totally agree with jamrom4 .. it was the most horrible movie i have ever seen .. holy shit it was horrible .. i was warned not to see it..and stupidly i l I watched anyway .. about 10 minutes after the painful experience, I completely gave up looking at the atrocity..but sitting until the end..just to see if I could .. well i did it and now I would like not to have it .. it was disgusting .. nothing happened and the end was all the preachers..no so bad movie has the right to survive..I beg you to spare yourself the terror of the fat drives the bus..if only I took into account the same warning..please save you from this movie .. I have the feeling that those who evaluated it were involved in making the movie ... and should all be scratched from the surface of the planet ..
