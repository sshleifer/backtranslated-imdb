I looked for a copy of The Forest because I was watching a special VH1, I think "Where are They Now", and I saw the video box scrolling on screen during a segment of the actor Corky Pigeon. He played the male kid ghost in this horrible horror B, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the TV show Silver Spoons. This film is a major disappointment. There is nothing here. It took me four months to look at it from beginning to end. I kept boring, putting it aside and forgetting it, then stumbling and trying to cross it again. Obviously, the angle of this film that was supposed to distinguish it from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And of course, here it does not work. I do not support male sons. I was still expecting them to look at their palms during longer dialogue scenes to read cheats. The situation at the beginning, where couples decide to go camping separately, is clumsy and stupid. I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks a leg, we can see the bone coming out of his flesh. It's pretty good gore makeup there. Dude, I'm really trying to be positive now, huh. The only other horror movie without a budget at a level as bad as this one would be Home Sweet Home.
