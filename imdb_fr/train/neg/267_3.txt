The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers takes place at an extremely slow pace, following Johnny Rico's departure from his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he covets, and his integration into the mobile infantry. The aliens of the series are nothing like the barbarian bugs of the film, but rather monsters that look like calamari that pull lasers out of their mouths. <br /> <br /> Throughout the viewing of this version, the fruity has always amazed me. they managed to do everything. The series focuses on the relationships between recruits and the long, painful look they see through their battle armor visors, with the synthesizer pop of the '80s sometimes arriving * during * the * scattered battle sequences that appear finally in the last episodes. In terms of construction, Top Gun has a debt to Top Gun, which shares a lot in terms of pace and content (and all that implies).
