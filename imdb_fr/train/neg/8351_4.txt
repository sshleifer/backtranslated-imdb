Pretty average, even by Monogram standards, this mystery (a remake of the Sphinx) has a strange plot that is not erased: you will see it after about ten minutes. The two main actors have a good dialogue at the beginning, but John Hamilton is desperately boring because the villain (Lionel Atwill, the perfect cast) is at the origin of the role) and Warren Hymer's Nitwit Shtick is rather annoying. However, the incomparable Mantan Moreland embodies the caretaker Nicodemus, who takes the best out of defense counsel in a hilarious court appearance. You must give it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not really a director, but he always put a routine programmer on the scene with some clumsy vaudeville.
