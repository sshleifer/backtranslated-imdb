I'm a big fan of Stooges, but the one and only quality of this film is that Curley is part of this movie. Made long before he starts drinking a lot, he is his classic in the field (and Larry is not bad either). The character of Moe is a straight part (most of the time) and this movie would be better named "The Curley and Larry Movie". None of Stooges's films were very good (in my opinion), but as one commentator put it, it's unfortunate that this film has real potential. The casting was good, it was well done, filmed and edited, but the screenplay tried to be something serious with just some Stooges antics and musical numbers (which, I think, were good at the time) . do it yourself during this film if you think it should be better than mowing the lawn and eliminating waste (subject to debate), it's waiting for the Curley / Larry scenes and sleeping or finding some dining thing in the kitchen. during the rest.
