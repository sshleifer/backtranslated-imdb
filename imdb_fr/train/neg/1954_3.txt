Let's start by doing it. . . Yes, this movie steals a LOT of 'Darkness Falls' (2003). The plot of 'Darkness Falls' looks like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement, kills people who look at her for revenge. In "The Tooth Fairy" (2006), the disfigured tooth fairy (who hides his face) unleashes his furious revenge against anyone. A bit too similar to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But the question is, if you want to steal the exact plot of a movie, why choose something as bad as Darkness Falls? "? Of course, this brought in a few dollars at the box office, but it was strictly for the passable theatrical experience that the film delivered. A low-budget movie and live video will not have the same effect. And this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Looking at the movie's 15-20 minutes, my expectations have increased. There seemed to be at least some production value. The story did not seem terrible, it was blatantly torn off. After the first scene, we have a good group of characters, including a former doctor with secrets (interpreted by the one who looks like a Busey) and a confirmed medical student (Jenifer from 'Masters of Horror: Jenifer' from Argento) . After these few minutes, however, the film slowly disappears. It serves all basic clich√©s, including but not limited to: a crazy old person with an ignored warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic and the stripper with the heart of gold. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems of this movie was its inability to stick to a target audience. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to change the tone of the character that was on the screen at that time. When the adults were on the screen, the feeling was more mature. When Star (the stripper) and his face (the jock) were on the screen, the dialogue shifted to a more stupid, wandering, immature level. When the kid was on the screen, it looked like an episode of "Are you afraid of the dark?" . . only less scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is everywhere. The visual effects range from very good to simple boring. The writing is mediocre, just like the act for most. On the plus side, there is some excessive gore in some places (including a pretty cool (but painfully predictable) logging scene) and a pretty vicious nailgun scene. Also, if you are looking for some sexy, there is a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this topless chick, there are better movies to do it). Apart from that, there is not much to do with this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of 'Darkness Falls' (there is one?), you may want to take a look at it. to see the story made in a different way. . . but that's pretty much the only reason I can find this one. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
