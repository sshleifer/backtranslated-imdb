In fact, I was hoping to have this movie since I saw Kari in other things and I think I have talent. Alas, this failure is a case study of what not to do in a scenario. Characters completely indefinite without any sympathy or conspiracy. Is it a road / boyfriend / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? Filmmakers have no idea, neither do we.
