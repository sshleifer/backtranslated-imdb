Some people seem to think this is the worst movie they have ever seen and I understand where they come from, but I really saw worse. <br /> <br /> That being said, the movies I remember (ie, the ones I did not block) that were worse than that, were so terrible that they physically struggled the senses involved in watching the film. Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to tear your eyes or stab you with sharp objects in your ears to prevent you from having another part of your soul torn from you by this horror. <Br /> <br /> War Games: The code of death is not so bad, but it's pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but no I did not expect miracles from it. Let's face it, the original was not really a great movie at first, it was actually just a romantic 80s movie with some geek appeal. <br /> <br /> That's all I hoped for. for, something bad, but that could have pulled on my geek strings. Was it too much to ask? Is it really possible to do better than the original war games, even for a direct video version? Apparently, it was asking too much. Stay away from this movie. At first, it's just bad, like "Oh yes, it's bad, but I like to enjoy it, maybe the end will be good as in the original." And then it gets worse and worse, and in the end, believe me, you wish you did not see this movie.
