I recently discovered that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD. When I was a child, the book was my favorite and I read it many times. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that some children actor do not look like the characters described in the novel, the Murry family is well chosen, with a nice Meg (although too pretty) in the center and a convincing Charles Wallace like a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is quite promising, which allows to establish the relationship between the main characters and to stage the scene. Unfortunately, as soon as the non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to crumble and, once the children have left the Earth, everything falls apart. Alfre Woodward is too young and much more royal than the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (think rather Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright) and Kate Nelligan has a face so masked and inexpressive that she had to visit the Faye Dunaway plastic surgeon in recent years. years. For some reason she is named Mrs. She looks like Glinda of the Wizard of Oz, when she should have looked like a benign witch from the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, what is more serious is the terrible special effects and artistic direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years ago. The incarnation of Mrs. Whatsits' centaur is a disaster, as is the costume of Chewbacca for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is an elegant and velvety creature in place of the incomparable Big Foot, as illustrated here. I could go on and on, almost every artistic choice is a disaster, probably because there was not enough budget to do justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and discernment. <br /> <br /> That would have really needed the sense of wonder that Spielberg had brought to his first films. It's a pity that with the current popularity of adapting the fantasy children's literary series, no one has thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and its suites for the big screen, giving it the reach it deserves.
