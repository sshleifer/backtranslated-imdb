Some people have made a point of dissociating this film because they questioned the plausibility of Blacks in the Old West, Asians in the Old West or women armed with guns in the Old West period. Take hold of your hand and read a book. There were a lot of Asians (Chinese), there were a lot of blacks (freed) and everyone outside the Gentile class had easy access to firearms; it's the second amendment you know. And as far as the use of the modern language is concerned, none of these Westerners has become nostalgic for a language actually used and in accordance with the time described. Americans had different accents, used different inflections, spoke at a very different pace, and used many words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Do not blame historical inaccuracies for not digging them. Be honest. Maybe you are just uncomfortable with what you see.
