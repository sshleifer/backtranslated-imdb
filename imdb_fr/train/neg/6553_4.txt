Years after the fall of the last of the big corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts. Cash, a cyborg woman, goes to an uncultivated land doctor to find out about her pregnancy. Fleeing from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to make its way to Cytown, the mythical refuge of cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: the rebreather" is the third far) in the trilogy of CYBORG. The first film was originally meant to be the sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial arts festival that has become a cult classic due to its honeyed action scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW is a suite that has improved over its predecessor but has not been widely seen (and was rejected by those who saw cheap fodder there). <br /> <br /> This movie tries to be a mix of the first two films (the first was a nerdy action movie while the second was a clever Cyberpunk story), but unfortunately it does not take into account the two points. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2, the film unfolding in the deserts of the desert (like so many post-apocalyptic action movies of the 90s), revolved around old industrial buildings to preserve costs. <br /> <br /> The story of the film is centered on a plot, that of a pregnant cyborg, as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to attempt this idea, the animated series OVA ARMITAGE III uses it more). But the film falls into the same trap as so many low-budget science fiction action films, in that the snags (synthetic organisms) described are nothing more than androids. Visual effects are nothing more than prosthetic arms and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite classic for this kind of film, the main actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the worst performer on the screen. Instead of rejoicing at the announcement of her pregnancy, she complains of all. His co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell being the type of gangster that animates the scenes in which he appears and Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, playing the right arm of Lynch, who will appear later in the remake and the sequel to THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE.
