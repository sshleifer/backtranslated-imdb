I have tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called "That 70's Show", I do not find much except for a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the 70's - the decade in which I grew up. Of the episodes I've seen, most conspiracies and jokes could happen in any period. Remove the novelty (supposed) happening in the 70s and the show is neither interesting nor fun. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a show that better represents the American youth experience in the 70s, IMHO, you can not beat the "The Wonder Years".
