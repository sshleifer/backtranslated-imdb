Pyare Mohan can be safely listed on the blacklist of one of the worst films of mankind. The film, one of the many disability films that emerged after Black's phenomenal success, is a mockery of the fraternity of the disabled. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are just caricatures of people with disabilities. While Black described the poignant character and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan showed two monkeys resembling despair that had no qualms about being disabled and jostling half of the world to protect their interests. lover. The music of Anu Malik is right. Vivek Oberoi, who made his promising debut with Saathiya, unfortunately quickly loses his balls in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty girls in trouble who live nightmares in Thialnd with no one to save them - with the exception of the aforementioned desperados. Boman Irani, like the mean Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
