There is no question of who commands cadet training in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in creating a new type of soldier of his cadets - the bomber. But it is not rigid enough to be unfair or hostile. In fact, he even changes his opinion about the value of women working in the army. He is tough when he needs to be, but at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he has perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything turns. O'Brien seems natural in the role and plays it well. Two things help this film: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular end of special effects.
