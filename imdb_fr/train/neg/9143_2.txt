as an actor, I really like independent films, but this one is at best amateur. <br /> <br /> The boys are going to Vermont for a public function, but when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - did the filmmakers know that the palm trees are not in Vermont? Yes pines - no palm trees. And the same for the wedding service - again a beautiful palm plantation. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave VT, they apparently could not get a ticket on a big airline since the plane filmed was Federal Express. Did they ship at night in a crate? Come on, the little details like this separate an Indian movie from totally amateur. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is much more gayer than Arthur with his whitened hair and his tribal group tattoo. Both characters should have exchanged roles. <br /> <br /> The minor characters are laughable and fall in love with something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause from the directors for making a gay movie, but be careful about your casting places next time
