To confess to having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a rather difficult admission for a heterosexual. But what can I tell you? Maybe it's something famous that everyone is talking about and that makes a star a star. He crosses this barrier. It takes you to an unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando got it off, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course, and more recently, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. The women have fallen in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and most recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt, on his own, redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and enter a theater to see "Troy". If you like epics in the style of "Jupiter's Darling", you can enjoy it. But if you do not, go anyway, we want Brad Pitt to stay in business.
