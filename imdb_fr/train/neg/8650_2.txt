If I had not seen an immature and credulous idiot, I could insist that I look at this "documentary", I would never have seen this comedy! This film is full of bad script and ludicrous moments. One of the cases in particular is where Afghan police and soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming on the street, while allowing the cameraman to film his arrest, then to move away, still filming, probably in his hotel. luxury. Then there is the scene where a car hits another car that has been turned over and parked on the side of the road without any signs of collision or explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised this currently has the rating it has (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users made more sense.
