I'm fed up with people using the name of God abusively to perpetuate their own sectarian vision of the world. Well, I do not reject the idea of ​​Armageddon, or the coming of the Antichrist, I reject the idea that only some people who lead a really good life the rest of us must suffer through millennia of Hell on Earth, just because we were not good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not think he will measure every level of goodness. Give a little credit to the Creator.
