Twenty years ago, five-year-old Michael Hawthorne had seen his father murder his mother with an ax in a deserted street and commit suicide later. Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends, Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country with her grandparents on their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest fear, and with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wood mannequin Morty (Jon Fedele) who would eliminate their fears . forever. Michael's biggest fear is to become a serial killer like his father, but something is wrong and Morty turns into a father by killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "The Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and useless slash. Film that uses the interesting concept to eliminate the deepest fear of each friend before he grows up, but in a complicated scenario filled with clich√©s. There is exaggerated performance, such as Ms. Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the game is good. Unfortunately, nothing explains why the model is brought to live; moreover, although surrounded by close friends, the group feels no pain or sorrow at the death of each of them. The slow pace of more than fifty minutes could have been used to improve the dramatic situation. In the end, Michael shows a charm that interested his father and that I did not notice in the course of history. I do not know if the previous reference was changed in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes of display. The special effects are very reasonable for a movie series. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Halloween Noise" ("Fear 2: A Halloween Night")
