one of my friends bought this (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never look at it because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover looked pathetic, but then my friends and I got really bored and looked at it. from beginning to end! I know it's a feat, but it's really a masterpiece. it's hard to describe. you should see it, it's a real lesson on what people can do when they think they're creative and smart and they're not. The "game" is underground (you can see the "main woman" laughing on some occasions, she is undoubtedly the worst). the "story" is too stupid to be summarized and really everything in this movie is nil. please, pay special attention to the "sheriff". the guy is an adult and so has no excuse to be involved in it. he is extremely bad too. however, there were hilarious moments. check it out, haha
