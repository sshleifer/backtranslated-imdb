Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal stable camera. Maximum number of scenes stretched, maximum headaches inducing jerking zooms, maximum characters walking in the woods doing nothing. Until the time flashes on the screen at 12:01, you can advance quickly and not miss anything, because there are three hunters for whom we do not know how to do anything. To be honest, the movie contains some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a video clip would have been the solution. Unfortunately, that should not be, and what should have been a twenty-minute short film is beyond belief. Forget about "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying to do it. - MERK
