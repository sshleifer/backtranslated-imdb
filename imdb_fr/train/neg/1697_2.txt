I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I have everything he did on DVD, with the exception of Hotel Room and the two-hour Twin Peaks movie. So when I discovered that, I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what is it? It's a bunch of roughly drawn black-and-white cartoons that are loud and dirty and not funny. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe it's just a bunch of shit that's been forced on the public under the name of David Lynch to earn a few dollars too. Let me say that I did not care about the vulgar language part, but that I had to adjust the sound permanently, because my neighbors might have already done so. Overall, it is a very disappointing release and it may well be that it has remained in the luxury box of curiosity. I strongly recommend that you do not spend your money on this. 2 out of 10
