Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> <br /> Directors: mainly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /> <br /> Performers: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring and Deran Serafin < <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> To review this movie and get a good overview, I have to start from the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn was released in '79, Lucio Fulci decided to make it an indirect sequel and call it Zombie 2. This movie is the one we know as Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK, so, after the film (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and generated a huge amount of money, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make even more zombie movies! These things are raking the dough! So, Zombie 3 is born. Still confused? The story of this one is actually just a summary of the stories we've seen in many American zombie movies we've seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see if the government is experimenting with some toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister is released in the general population and shebang! We have tons of zombies that yearn for human flesh. A group of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They must fight the zombies to survive. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of problems when shooting this movie. Above all, Lucio Fulci, the beloved godfather of Gore in Italy, was sick. So he could not really finish this movie as he wanted. The film was then transmitted to two less important directors, Bruno Mattei (Hell of the living dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a movie that was not so good. You see that Fulci himself did not really have his heart and soul on this movie. He was disenchanted with that. He gave the film to the producers and basically said, "Do what you want with that!" And God loves them, they loved them. <br /> <br /> And that's why, ladies and gentlemen, we have a crappy zombie movie with the great Fulci, credited with his "director". The main problem in my opinion is that it is such a useless trouble! There is no substance to it! After the first few minutes, during which terrorists stole the toxic gas and accidentally released it, the rest of the sequence is just a group of empty, soulless characters, devoid of any personality and fleeing the zombies. Now, in some cases, it can be fun, if # 1 makeup and zombie action are really good and fun and # 2 there is a lot of gore and guts involved. <br /> <br /> Here we get neither! There are inspired moments, for example when eagles are contaminated by gas and start attacking people. It was cool. There is also a scene with a flying zombie head (which, by the way, defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the abandoned hotel pool and nibbling a poor girl's legs. But other than that ... the rest of the movie just falls flat. <br /> <br /> An infinity of endless scenes that do not allow to advance the already non-existent plot. That was my main complaint with this movie. The sets seem unfinished and the artistic direction is practically non-existent. I hate when everything seems so unfinished! I like my B-movies, but this one really went below! Its closest to a z level zappe, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Zombie makeup? Pure shit. The zombies are all Asian actors (the film was shot in the Philippines), so you get a bunch of Asian zombies. But this is not a big problem since the film was done anyway in the Phillipine Islands. It's the look of zombies that really fears! They all died with the same clothes for some reason. And what happens to the zombie makeup here is a bunch of black makeup (rather spots) on their faces. One or two zombies had a little more complex makeup, but it was not enough to impress. It's just a band of goo unnecessarily splashed on the faces of the actors. So, not only is this movie slow, but zombies look like shit. These are supposed to be dead people! Anyway, for those who expect the usual freshness of a Fulci movie, do not expect it here, because it's mostly about someone else's movie. And the two people involved (Mattei and Fragasso) did not really put their hearts and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD, you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his memories and feelings about this film, he does not even take it seriously. You can say that he is ashamed of this and that he has often said that they "just had a job to do and they did it". And that my friends, is the last nail on this movie. There is no love and no heart to make this movie. As a result, you get a half-nil and miserable zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Only for the most complete or for people who wish to have or see all the zombie movies ever made. All others, do not even worry! Rating: 1 out of 5
