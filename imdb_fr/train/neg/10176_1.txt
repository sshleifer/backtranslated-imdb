MAJOR LEAGUE: RETURN TO MINORS (1998) ½ * <br /> <br /> With: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Filed PG-13 (For language and some violence) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, in John Warren's new comedy "Major League: Again to minors ", there is a funny scene. This is a sequence in which an angry coach throws a baseball into the wall behind him, kicking him on the cement, bouncing him off and hitting him in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, that's all this movie has to offer ... enough said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally degraded, not typically developed, predictable and poorly written, but also simply bad. Even non-critical viewers will hate this movie with everything they have. It's so familiar that it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> How often does the same movie about sport have to be shot? In recent years, we have seen the same material in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver" and, as bad as this film is, it's even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family oriented. "Major league back to minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to watch together on a Sunday afternoon. It's too childish for adults. So who is this film for? Teenagers? Seniors? Are people looking so much for entertainment that they rent something like this? <br /> <br /> The film, like many others like this one, has a fundamental purpose that it tries to assert: teamwork triumphs over everything. Yes, and what a great moral to try to prove. Too bad we have already seen and except that he has so often lacked talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina suits. Where ridiculous advertisers form their own "buddies routine" mumbling a single garment, such as "they suck", "this fast kids ball is timed with an hourglass", "this guy broke down for a moment to find something that he lost - maybe it was his mind, "" Someone needs a nap "and" never see a sunset as beautiful as this game ". Where characters have so little importance to each other that we never know them by name. And where the only teamwork conference scene that is close to our hearts is so unknown that it's almost funny. <br /> <br /> "The Major League Back to the Minors" is so serious; he holds his banal end in the middle of a good closing sequence. The good baseball team is back, she is about to win and - the power goes out. I thought for a moment that this trash was coming to an end, but in reality, its final false stage is only to add minutes to the time that passes. The film is essentially a series of sketches unrelated to many putrid jokes, it's not funny. There is another fun line of dialogue where a coach and a player discuss why a long-time player is no longer wanted in this position. The coach's response: "You're too old, too slow and too big." The player's reaction is to die for. But this scene certainly does not make this movie worthy of your time and certainly not worth a penny of your money. <br /> <br /> Here is another terrible entry in this kind of film, another convict with his own script, which has failed before, and another so familiar that it looks like a déjà vu again. <br /> <br />
