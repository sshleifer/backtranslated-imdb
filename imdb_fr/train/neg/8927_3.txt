Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - drunk dead) and introduces himself as Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and teaches the film's story in a theater college run by the lush John Huston (do not ask) and separates a happy young couple (the young and handsome Roger Herren). Farrah Fawcett - yes LA Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They took a great novel by Gore Vidal that was infilmable and, of course, tried to film it. They also engaged an Englishman with a decidedly anti-American stance and a group of dubious "talented" actors (Welch, Reed) and embarrassed old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), threw it all together and .... SURPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film got an X rating when it was released (it was lowered to an R), mainly because of a really tasteless scene in which Welch sodomized Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch tries to have sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The movie is very scattershot ... scenes are popping up everywhere and people are saying and doing things that make no sense. It's not good at all but I never got bored. <br /> <br /> The acts vary enormously ... Reed is horrible ... really sad. Huston chews the landscape again and again and again to an extremely nauseating. Welch is actually not bad like Myra but his lines are meaningless and you never know what to do with it. West is barely in the film (a blessing) and it's really a bit sick to hear a woman nearly 80 years old make sexual jokes. Roger Herren (no matter what happened ...) was very young, handsome and not bad like Rusty. Fawcett is fine. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find anything to say about it ... you look at it in disbelief. A movie to see absolutely - to believe !!!!
