I guess I've seen worse movies, but maybe it's because I'm so jaded about the quality of those bad horror movies. The monster killer thing is really bad, basically it's a guy in some kind of green body suit. There is much worse to play in the movie B, but do not believe for a second that it is something extraordinary, no. There was a plot with substance, but it was still pretty stupid. Basically, it's just a bad budget horror movie. But at least, it's not as serious as Titanic, this film fears the balls, that one just fears. The blood seems really wrong in this film. This is one of the grievances I have about all the horror of the new millinium, low-grade gore, looks stupid. A horrible death scene with fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a beautiful shower scene
