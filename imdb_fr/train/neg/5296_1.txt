I'm not a big fan of slasher movies as a genre, but even under low-budget operating standards, this one is really bad. Even at a level of nudity and gore, it's incredibly boring (there's a bit of both, but it's kind of ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it may not even have been released in theaters (although that may have been the case, after all * Plan 9 of Space * was shown in theaters). There is precisely a quality line (and competently provided) throughout the film; I guess they stole it somewhere. <br /> <br /> The acting game is one of the worst I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a few competent actors, and the rest tended to be ridiculous, which can be fun to watch. In any case, most of his actors could be considered literate. Here, those who do not read their lines, like the Indians of the cigar shops, have the impression of having learned them verbally. And this film has a distinction: it manages to be under-exploited for most of the film, then ridiculously over-exploited for the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have pointed to the actress playing the role of receptionist She is not made of wood, not that she is good, but she is certainly not made of wood .) <br /> <br /> Even the worst slasher movies are generally good for some puritanical meditations on their grotesque offensive, but with this one, there does not even seem to be anything that could provoke an outrage moral. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest thing? They were clearly expecting to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so painful and boring that it becomes really fascinating. I was excited about most of the video and wondered why someone would bother to do it.
