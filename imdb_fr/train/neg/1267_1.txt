Why me? Why should I be subjected to such a massacre of what could have made an interesting plot ?! At least, if I can warn others, it will have been worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible film to take a university course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis at the back of the thing and would have avoided. The film was slow, had very little character development, and was centered on the idea that a terrifying little white man can get cool if he hangs out with a fashionable black man, LA. <br /> <br /> If you want to discover LA's stereotypical sense of breathtaking superficiality - watch the movie. Note, however, that this film does not DEPICT what we have come to consider as a "lifestyle in Los Angeles", it is a wonderful example of the resulting products.
