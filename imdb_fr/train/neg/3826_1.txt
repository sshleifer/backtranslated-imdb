Damn, I thought I saw bad westerns. You can not on this one though. Hell, I think I'd rather have my eyes closed for a Trinity Triple Feature to cry aloud. I do not think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without making fun of my ass. Really bad. <br /> <br /> But, if you like stupid westerns with famous stars, take a look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but a lot more funny. 1/10
