It was the third remake of Sleeping with boredom after YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one that worked and was a better movie <br /> <br /> DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan who unfortunately failed here <br /> <br /> The story was good but the manipulation was not so good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax was disappointing <br /> > <br /> The direction is bad The music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi takes again his role of YAARANA (strangely which was also a remake of SWTE) and looks too big for the main role and that it's ok Juhi is decent while Arbaaz tries too much in his debut and succeeds in many scenes to cool the audience but his voice was terrible Johny is too strong
