This film is poor in garbage. He has a horrible taste, he is pedestrian and unconvincing in his scenario, although it is supposed to be based on real events - which does not add much to anything, but makes it a more disappointing . The direction is not well done because the scenes and dialogues are moved. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. For starters, Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup, and the relationship itself is not interesting. Worse still, his character is constrained by a lousy pedophile story that is baseless and has no place as a plot. You have an older Rory Culkin who says "d_ck_smker" - in a funny way - which is quite annoying and that Williams' character made you laugh. Finally, you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel advisor to Williams and a detailed explanation of the complete fiasco towards the end. The character of Toni Collete is simply annoying and is a reshuffle of his 6th Sense performance with a more mediocre direction. Very Miss-able.
