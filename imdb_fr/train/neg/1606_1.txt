In this film, supporters of Chávez (Venezuelan and non-Venezuelan) lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict had erupted following the announcement of Chávez who dismissed many of the best PDVSA workers for political reasons only. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything other than 96 TV interruptions transmitted by Chávez for only 3 days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of confiscation of private television signals). Each person lasted about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about the announcement of the departure made by the general in Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, inspector general of the armed forces, traditional supporter of Chávez. . Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Minister of the Interior and Justice. After the return of Chávez, he held the position of Ministro del Defensa (equivalent of the US Secretary of Defense). <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Chávez's orders about firing against a concentration of pacifist people who demanded elections. They did not say anything about the members of this concentration who were killed by supporters of Chávez (civilians and military forces). <br /> <br /> They present certain facts in a bad order, to lie. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about the Venezuelan civil society that is still demanding elections today to resolve the crisis and Chávez's actions to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm telling you .... This movie is just a bunch of lies or a big lie.
