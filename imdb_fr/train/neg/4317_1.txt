My wife and I found this movie very schlocky. Everything started well, but quickly became incredible and ridiculous. Most of the actors were poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who was really great. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon, the Angel. Moreover, without revealing anything, when one of the characters is tragic, she seems almost nonchalant. At first we thought it was a shock, but we realized it was just a terrible scenario. We love almost all Hallmark films and their comforting stories, but this film is not up to the occasion. There are so many excellent ones - do not waste your time with this horrible film.
