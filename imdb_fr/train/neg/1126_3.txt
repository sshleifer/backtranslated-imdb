I praised this idea thinking that it might be interesting, and that it could have been an interesting story, except that it was told in such an uninteresting way. Difficult to follow, strange editing, disjointed scenario, the characters mumble, all in all a loss of time terribly dull. I just could not get into the movie and I did not care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm could save that movie. Unless you need treatment for insomnia, I'll skip it. 3/10, and it's generous.
