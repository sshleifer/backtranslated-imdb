Another fact for TV! It's an insult to a war movie (I use the word film in its most approximate form possible!) I thought that Telly Savalas' career had reached the climax when he made the voiceover during this visit. regularly, but I forgot he was involved in all this! I tried to put it in my subconscious memory, but the cable TV had kicked me and screamed! <br /> <br /> I like the piece (sarcastic laughter!) of the movie that claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the forties, but it's really a clich√© of the Zagreb cathedral in the late eighties -twenty. The steam train where the commandos train shows also the JZ logo (Yugoslavia Zeleznice or Yugoslav State Railways) on the side of the locomotive, although the manufacturers have tried to hide them. Why not just film in the UK, if that's where most of the film takes place? <br /> <br /> Cheap waste and wasted celluloid!
