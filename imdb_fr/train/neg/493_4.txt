A dysfunctional family returns home for the holidays and the resulting murder and chaos. Sexy rape Milligan at her most done at home. A little better than a movie at home (as are many Milligans movies), it's a journey in the depraved style of the 1960s. Remarkable for its nudity and rich sex, this movie is not sexy neither horrible, it is now playing more picturesque (although resolutely recommended). The film suffers from uneven distribution and low cost of production (no one was ever sure where the money was going in his films since he was still broke). It's a bad film that is not worth seeing, except as a Milligan completist or because it attracts very beautiful people.
