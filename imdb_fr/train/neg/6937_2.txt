The last subject addressed by this last adman-turned-director-film is a rather old topic of discussion according to almost all cultural standards: the timeless romance (play on words). <br /> <br /> However, the exploration (and the exploitation of Desi auds) is terribly short, because the habitual addictions for "pepper, spices and sugar" constitute the usual masala mixture of partition b / g, of dialogue, dance, theater, etc. create a beautiful set. with not much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8 to 9 times. Other rehearsals follow throughout the film (after all, the main character is a cook). But here are the problemos - no history! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh adds a Cheeni Jyada (plus) to an amount of over-action. Really when will this guy ever stop ?? How many people in their 60s walk around like that even when they are teased by a 30 year old nubile? Timeless spirit yes, but what about the body that is not ageless? And the sole? Sorry, soul ?! A reasonably good role of Paresh Rawal, who plays the only sensible role in the film. The director lacks realism and is not carried away by his unpublished discovery of a new idea. Nowhere are we confronted with real-life problems or problems that this couple might face, apart from getting married, which is just the initial hurdle. The subplot of a little boy suffering from cancer (the first love of the single boy) goes nowhere and whatever the slight poignant intensity that this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked disappears quickly with the character of the girl. <br /> <br /> Anyway, well tried but not there yet.
