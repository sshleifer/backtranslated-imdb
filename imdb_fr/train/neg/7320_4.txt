Bondage, humiliation, an S & M show and not much else. The plot is flat, really just a banal setup for the elegantly depraved sets. The host of the aforementioned show, a silly little man who vomited while singing around the stage in dress, was almost as painful as attempts at artistic editing. The dreamlike end felt hooked. To the merit of the film however, Aya Sugimoto was quite convincing as a tortured leader. Flower and Snake has been compared to Eyes Wide Shut, but apart from some minor surface similarities, Kubrick is easily the most stratified, artistic and atmospheric painting.
