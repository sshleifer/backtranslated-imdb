The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately, this film does not do it justice. The casting was pretty good and the filming was beautiful - but stylistically, much of the direction was inconsistent (fast editing on-style, but without result ... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to appear in the credits, followed by a advertising), the characters were identified exclusively by the use of on-screen coke (and virtually everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no attractive characters to draw the viewer into the story. A very forgettable film.
