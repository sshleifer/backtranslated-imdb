Formula movie guy who wants a girl, guy who will lie to approach a girl, guy who will have the best friend to help extravagantly (comedus reliefus, no?) To help deceive the girl, etc. and with rare exceptions to some outings classified Z, it is better done. <br /> <br /> Intrigue aside, the tracks are attractive and there are some good times. Jonathon Schaech did better, and his role here was almost called. Not a total loss, but nothing new here in this tepid affair.
