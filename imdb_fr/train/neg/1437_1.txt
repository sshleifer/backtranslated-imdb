I missed the first 10 minutes of the movie, but I do not think watching it from the beginning would have made a difference. I found the film extremely boring and I was disappointed by the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in exceptional roles, but they were all disappointed here because of a very weak scenario. "Kind Salomon's Mines" ... the very short part of the film inside the "mines" was as exciting as watching the paint dry and I doubt that even a preschool child would have been fascinated by the fight the warriors The whole movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced American TV series, give me Indiana Jones any day!
