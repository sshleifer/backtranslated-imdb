In general, I do not like Sydney Pollack's films ("The Firm" being an exception) and I have never been a Robert Redford fan either. Still, I thought that "Three days of the condor" had to be good because of the number of complimentary comments he received. <br /> <br /> Although widescreen cinematography is very pleasant for the eye and Max von Sydow makes a beautiful As a sinister professional killer, I found the case extremely disappointing. The film undeniably exudes a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the confusing intrigue that makes no sense. <br /> <br /> The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory conclusions that I know that really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can be said about this absurd love affair between Redford and Dunaway? I would much rather watch one of Hitchcock's movies five times in a row rather than go through this garbage again.
