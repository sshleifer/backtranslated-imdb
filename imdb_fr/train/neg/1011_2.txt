LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And it's the star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. Like in sat-on-a-shelf. What it did. And with reason. The conspiracy as such involves a squad of corrupt killer policemen at MAGNUM FORCE, and the "journalist" Timberlake is the only brave enough to discover them. He is targeted for his efforts - or maybe I should say for his horrible game. I turned it off after one of the villains was shot in the forehead and I still had the foresight to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Simply horrible. The real hint of the seriousness of this movie is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the film sporting an unruly beard, which looks nothing like a tramp. You just know that the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly slumming.
