As far as cinematography is concerned, this film was pretty good for the mid-fifties. A few times, the lighting was too hot, but the shots were usually in the frame and remained in focus. The acting was above average for a small budget but the management was awful. Several scenes were dragged too long in an attempt of suspense and the effects were nonexistent. The skull attack in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to revive the skull was evident with clubbing and strings. I could not help but think that the budget did not allow them to furnish the house, so they continued to refer to the movers and that all the stored items would be available soon. Honestly ... it would have been more fun if the movie had been worse. It was not serious enough to be a "good-bad" movie but not good enough to be "good" either. Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
