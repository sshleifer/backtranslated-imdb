This ghost film by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is quite wild, and he was at least one afraid of the jump that caught me off guard. But all in all, the movie is incredibly stupid, a detective trying to find a suspected serial killer, but only to discover that he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a beautiful Asian ghost woman, and does not know why (and the viewer either). As more murders are committed, it becomes even more confusing because the murderers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, but the ghost lady is funnier than anything, especially when she suddenly flies over the city, like Wonder Woman. And the end does not make sense. In fact, the whole movie does not make sense and I can not recommend it at all. If it did not take itself so seriously, I would think it's supposed to be a black comedy. Apart from "Bright Future", this is the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa that I have ever seen.
