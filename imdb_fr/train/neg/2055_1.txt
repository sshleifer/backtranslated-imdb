There is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "movie". The original says everything and still holds. Read the book or research the story and you will realize that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! Having visited Holcomb & Edgerton, KS, where the story unfolds, the sets and locations look nothing like Kansas. The original is fascinating, from the shooting location to the use of actual participants, weapons and personal effects of the victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Quincy Jones soundtrack and Conrad Hall's cinematography ... The original is now available on widescreen DVD. Let this turkey die a quick death.
