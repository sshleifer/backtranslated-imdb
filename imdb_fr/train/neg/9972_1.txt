CHILD PROBLEM is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! It's a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but he has problems later. This junior can drive Grandpa's car. It can scare people with a bear. He can set fire to a room! It's a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A sequel is an even worse destiny. RENT CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on **** I give it.
