I have a question for those who have thought of this idea. Why? Which made them think of making a second film. If my memory is faithful, did not Cinderella stop with "They all lived happy forever"? I'm pretty sure yes, or it was implied. Wait a minute, if they all lived happily, how could there be a sequel? Unless you try to make the most boring story in history, there would be no follow-up. I mean of course, they could have Cinderella sing nonsense for two hours, but why? A film that ends with "fortunately forever" can not follow; if so, they will not live happy forever! Something is wrong that causes problems with the first end! Why? It's not fair, it's bad. This is my last word on the question.
