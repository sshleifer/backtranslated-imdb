Even more than 20 years later, Ninja Mission is the worst movie I have ever managed to do. The Scandinavian ninjas penetrate into silence, fire their incredibly noisy machine guns with wild abandon, then leave in silence. Wow, how are we going to find those silent invisible assassins? Just follow the sleeves and smoke! Painful dialogue (or was it brilliant and badly translated?), Not a prominent Asian in distribution, and an impressive total of 3 Asians among the stunt team. The plot is ridiculous, the acting almost non-existent - but again, the ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid looking at all costs!
