The plot of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea and the subject is of interest. But throughout the viewing of this film, we said aloud: "These filmmakers are struggling to find the right places, the light is good, makeup and hair are good ... why the sound is it so bad?" Throughout the film, the sound was echoed, blurred and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There's a good game in this movie, and I think Jim Thalman is a really good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a big budget movie. <br /> <br /> I can not say too much - if you have a limited budget, spend more on good sound. . Sound is as much a part of a movie as the picture, and it's worth it. Could have won 6.
