I waited impatiently to see this film and then realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was submerged by useless curses. Now, I'm by no means a prude, but shouting obscenities at each other does not make a good movie. Ewan Bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at the moment (testify of his performance in the god Life of Stuff) and his accent "Cockney" is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. To avoid. How many of these "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" movies, "Beautiful Creatures" must we suffer before the filmmakers realize that the word f, the word c, etc. does not replace an appropriate dialog.
