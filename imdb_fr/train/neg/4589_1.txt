Do you remember the channeler smoking the channel exposed on 60 Minutes a few years ago? It's her. Many people have watched this film without checking the good faith of the filmmakers. Producers use fake "word of mouth" promotions with great success, without revealing the financial and philosophical underpinnings of this piece of marketing. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, the new age sinking and the day baloney, this film is for you. If you want to discuss quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this film is to convince you that Ramtha is not crazy, so you will give him a lot of your money. If you can browse the Ramtha website without screaming in disbelief, then you may think that the money you traded for this ad for the madness has been spent. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
