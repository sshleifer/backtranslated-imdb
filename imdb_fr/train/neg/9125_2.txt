This is one of the fun aspects of youth that can easily be advertised. I've already talked about another movie, in which advertising for the (comic) movie makes it more funny than it actually is. Seeing the advertisement for that in 1981 made me think that it would be an extremely funny movie. What me and my brother who went to see this with me did not know is that the scene used in TV advertising was the very last scene of the movie! <br /> <br /> As this scene is the end result of all that preceded the film, I can only guess that there was nothing fun to use! The last scene is, thanks to a youthful potion, Dr. Fu Manchu went from a bearded old man to a young and brilliant Asian / Elvis like a rock star! <br /> <br /> Without any valid reason, Peter Sellers, in the 1930s, does his best with the material available, but he has no valid reason to give his "comedy" moments. The rest of the actors were just boring and my brother and I were sitting all that time laughing at nothing. It was natural that we were expecting a "Pink Panther" comedy, Peter Sellers was so good at it. <br /> <br /> Too bad, it was his last film before his death. His appearance at the Muppet Show was more entertaining than this ill-conceived flop. Yet I do not blame him. I blame everyone involved for not trying to make a better film about it. 2 stars is generous !!
