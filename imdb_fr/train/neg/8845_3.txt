I watched this knowing almost nothing about it, except for the brief description I read here. After watching it, I initially wanted to say that the director shows promise but seems rather amateur, then I looked at the other things he did to see if it was his first or second film, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He sort of missed the target in these two films and it was the same with this one. <br /> <br /> The story was pretty awful too. Could someone fall in love with a girl because she is pretty but has the mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed towards the end, but overall, this movie is rather terrible.
