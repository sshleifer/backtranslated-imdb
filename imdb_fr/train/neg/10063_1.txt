Now, I have never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what physiological significance does it have in the songs of the movie? WOW, some crazy Pokémon show up and they multiply, I can have one. Animie is useless. The authors of this project are in vain. His marketing plan will just seem to reduce the number of songs and he will get a good rating. I think this movie would have been nice if it had sent a message, you have to see all episodes of Pokémon understand what is happening and it's not a movie. It's just an animation that should be on video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I'm going to give him a 1 because I just got 5 bucks. I could not give him a half because there are no halves.
