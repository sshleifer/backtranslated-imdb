This film is a re-writing of Warren Beatty's 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait", but it is written for Mr Rock's comic style. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life is over and works with God's representative, Mr. King, to return to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's film; he chooses the murderer of Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he believes that Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) is at Wellington during the assassination. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea of ​​transforming a senior white multimillionaire into a black comedian who tries to woo Sontee just does not work. In addition, the dividers used to show Rock as Wellington, then as the real Wellington "white", fail miserably. Improvements could have been made to Beatty's original plot - which in itself did not masterfully depict the idea of ​​life after death - but they certainly were not in "Down to Earth".
