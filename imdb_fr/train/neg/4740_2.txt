I'm so insulted by this film that it's not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was amazing! Even though my expectations of Disney have become less, I have never thought they would do something as stereotypical and yet offbeat. There is no respect here for any authentic Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that they have tried to make Wendy a normal teenager ... Teenage girls - especially Asian teenagers - are much less obsessed with such superficial aspects of life. And from a cultural point of view, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are packed with popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are are still quite decent scholars. Another stereotype, perhaps, but true enough. Because that's how Chinese parents work. That's how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to look for authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This only adds to my frustration with American films. Asian culture does not speak of meditation or vague and nature-oriented phrases that sound good. We do not walk all the time smiling enigmatically and we do not all know one form or another of martial arts. We are a people and I would be grateful for someone to write an Asian part that does not describe us as a sad caricature.
