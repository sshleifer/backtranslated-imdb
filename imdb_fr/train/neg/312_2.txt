If you've ever seen this movie, you'll know it! If you have not done so yet and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie because it ranks among the worst. So, if you are REALLY bored, go rent it. If you want to know how it goes, here is my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some models of Ms Universe and five other people. Adam does not like the way a passenger catches all the babies, and he tries to take over with his jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! You will have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
