Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who, with the advice of a reputable agent, has a lot of potential. Obviously, the person who guided her in this tragedy is not someone who cares about her career. I sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who went en masse looking for another movie to sneak in and wonder who thought this movie would please everyone. It was badly written, the casting director could have put one or two minutes of effort in the characters and the director did not care for that.
