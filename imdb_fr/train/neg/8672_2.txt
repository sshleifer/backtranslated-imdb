Most of the action films are filthy Hindi cinema, especially Sunny and his family <br /> <br /> The film is typical of Sunny with low shots, big dialogues and melodrama <br /> <br /> Ingredients Rai many henchmen and a weird villain <br /> <br /> The start is good, then the turn to Kenya is good, but the film goes on and on again <br /> <br /> The sequence of events is moving at a slow pace and nothing is going so well <br /> <br /> There are a lot of stupid scenes like the Kenyan police are shown as jokers especially Sharat <br> /> <br /> The climax is also extended <br /> <Rajiv Rai is doing its job The music is fine, one song is enough and it is the last TOOFAN. The photographic work is good <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is as usual, Chunky behaves like a monkey while his serious the scenes are laughable, Naseer is fine, the heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri n ' is not even as scary as it was in TRIDEV the rest is fine
