I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous poster of MEATBALLS and I guessed it must be the best satire of all time. What a brilliant idea for a satire - the genre is commonplace. Unfortunately, the finished product (as everyone involved probably does) is a catalog of missed opportunities, performance not quite there and (thankfully!) Some extremely hilarious and inspired excerpts. Janeane Garafolo, very striking, looks really bad here, probably because she has a hard time making her flat role funny. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to watch, trying to become funny and looking like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny to see her make you laugh, but her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had good manners as a teenager and was as sexy as hell, the other guys are also really funny (the most nervous). I think the problem is that the director is not getting things done at the right pace. It begins very impassive, and it defines the monotonous. But when he lets things get really scandalous (the drug sequence is the second funniest moment of my life at the movies, the first also in a lame film: Andrea Martin in ALL OVER THE GUY who complains about the movie IN & OUT ), it's just funny. I wanted this movie to work so bad, but it just is not the case. The clothes and style for 1981 are perfect at 99.9%, and the very rare songs used are also perfect. This results in a television episode on medium-mediocre television, with frustrating sketches.
