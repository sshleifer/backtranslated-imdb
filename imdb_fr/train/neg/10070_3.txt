Roy Rogers plays the role of Jesse James and his fellow player Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is the former friend of Mr. Rogers, sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) form a remarkable team, two reporters looking for stories about the elusive elusive hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, an erroneous identity / impersonation is a development plot, since Rogers is attempting a "dual role". Rogers is charming, as usual; but nothing really elevates it above the ordinary - any material that can produce a memorable performance of Jekyll / Hyde is exploited. The two best people to watch are Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye as reporters of the St. Louis Journal - they are the highlight of the film. The songs are good, although not synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
