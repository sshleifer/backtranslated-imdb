I often make a point of watching bad movies, and the original movies of the science fiction channel tend to be one of the best sources for those movies you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of oubli. The acting was unusually subnormal, contrary to what sci-fi usually holds. There are some cameos made by people you probably recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. The special effects of CGI are minimal and, as a result, one of the greatest sources of comedy in a sci-fi movie is missing. Of course, there are fun times, like when a guy is beheaded by a bulldozer or the main character lets his friend die to save a girl he's known for a few days, but overall, he ends up for not having you roll on the ground with laughter, and I consider it a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> If I rated it on a 10-star scale designed specifically to judge made-to-measure movies, I'd probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. It's a shame that I have to wait for the next original sci-fi movie to have a good laugh, and I really hope this movie will not be part of an overall increase in the quality of science fiction -fi original films.
