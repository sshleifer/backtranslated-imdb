This film was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If the fast shots get faster than that, we might as well pay twenty dollars to get into the laundromat, grab some popcorn and watch the dryer turn. Jet Li is so much better than that. One can only hope that he will not agree any time soon to make another film cliche like The One. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie to avoid, it's "The One".
