this could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not see how that could be described as a horror movie or even a thriller? it's more like a heavy drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT, but as there were no scary situations, the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like doing a dump or going down stairs. the film had so much potential. they had a nice cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed that the writers thought you already knew them. they would be subjected to particular activities without explanation or even a clue to what they meant. it's just one of those movies that says it's something and something totally different.
