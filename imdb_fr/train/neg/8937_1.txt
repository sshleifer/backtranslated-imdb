Generally, I like horror movies, but unfortunately, that fell from the bargain basket of a pound into the hand of my friends. We sat down to watch it, ready to be scared and ended up spraying food wherever we laughed so much. The concept is not so bad, but why they decided that the number ten in the series would be lucky, I do not know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera work was mediocre, the special effects are actually not so bad if I'm generous, but overall, the story was not connected because the actors were as effective as a small piece well-calcined elm. They were exceptional people, especially a spooky fifteen-year-old actor too young to be taken seriously as a government agent. In fact, he looked more like a public school boy. There was a really funny sex scene where he seemed to be swinging apples while a buxom lady was riding him and later, his waist-length underpants were hysterical, but I remembered that was not supposed to be a comedy. I'm looking desperately for something positive to say about this movie apart from some occasional bursts, but that's just not the case. Let's hope that ten is the lucky number and that they do not make another one, I'm not sure that my ribs can stand it.
