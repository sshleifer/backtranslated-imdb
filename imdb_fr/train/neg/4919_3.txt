I have rarely been as bored by a leading performance as by Ali McGraw in this film. Is God boring or what? She says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible that Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is not a lot of history. He is rich, she is in wood, they must both sacrifice a lot for love. His father's name is Stonewall Jackson, his name is his own, in case you did not notice the difference in The Two of Them they defeated in the name of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominations for this film indicate that it must have been a bad year. John Marley is doing well as Wooden's father, but a candidate for support? At least, Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but again, if it depended on me, Katharine Ross would have been in a lot more movies. She is certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I did not even cry when she got sick, I never realized I was feeling sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones look like he was around 15 years old and the score is good. But this one is so old now that he has a beard one kilometer long and the sin of it is not so old, but he feels it.
