A prologue text warns us that we should not let evil come in, but I think the most appropriate word is "entropy". Good grief, what are these two guys! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his San Francisco office and in his monstrously expensive house in Tiburon, while his wife and child are in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke like Jackson and Colleen Camp like Donna) knock on the door to ask for directions. Well, it's raining, and they're shivering like two soaked and soaked kittens, and they're not sure where they're going, and what, with one thing and another, George invites them to come and take part at his pizza by the fire. The three of them end up in George's bathtub and there results about five minutes of almost undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure and dod√©kakuple exposure. They spend the night in a trio and the next morning, the girls prepare her breakfast. But something stung a little because Georgie's guests swallow everything with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup on the laundry and - "You eat like ANIMALS!" Exclaims George and tells them to go out. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is a blonde girl with an extraordinary look and cobalt blue eyes. Colleen Camp bounces like a super-ball. You must say that they are raising them beautiful here in Shelbyville, Tennessee, from where Locke is from, and that they also raise them with fluffy bunches, as we can not help but notice afterwards. first five or ten minutes. <BR /> <br /> But when girls go crazy, the movie becomes crazy too. The film is then bathed in a bright green light. The two men wear makeup macabre and make grimaces of gargoyle in the mirrors. They think of a delivery man and then drown him to make sure. They cause a storm and break windows and furniture. They have one of these scenes in which two people sit in front of the table, licking food and then jumping one after the other. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? They first made Georgie unconscious with mace (which contains nothing you can not find in this little red bottle of McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet), attach it, pour flour and milk on make him undergo a psychotic trial, have him undergo one of these half-executions of the Tolstoy genre, slap him, disguise himself with bizarre costumes, then wander against him and his almost destroyed home of the upper middle class and send it by an ex machina delivery truck. <br /> <br /> As for the actors' game, it's as if someone said to Georgie, "Act politely with these girls first, then act there panick after being tied. " And girls: "First act shy, not wanting to impose on anyone, then crazy." And that's all. <br /> <br /> Photography and filming are straight out of a porn movie from the 1970s. I'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skills. It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco into ugly. The score gives us two leitmotivs. Georgie's is a pop song with lyrics about "being free" and "giving in". Jackson and Donna is a catchy thing called "My Good Old Dad". <br /> <br /> I agree with the moral lesson behind the story, though. There are some things you just should not give up, even though it may seem like a lot of fun at first. All very informative.
