This film features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. He also boasts of Larry Miller, always so nice, in a too small part. Despite this, I found it almost unassailable. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty but she is almost without charisma and the reasons for Downey's obsession with her character are not at all comprehensible in terms of the information presented by the film or the way it is portrayed. . The end seems pretentious and even if the intention seems to be that the public adheres to the film and winks at the film, having failed to bring us on the side of its protagonists, it leaves us reluctant or unable to do so . <br /> <Fans of the film say that those who do not agree are simply "did not understand". I do not think that's the case. The plot was neither complicated nor incomprehensible. It was simply not involved and made clumsily and obviously. J? I understand. "I did not like that." I Went Down "by Paddy Breathnach and" Snatch "and" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Smoking "by Guy Ritchie are much better examples of the kind of film directed by director Shane. Black failed to achieve. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black but a look at his credits (mainly as a screenwriter) makes me want to dissociate myself from any other connection .
