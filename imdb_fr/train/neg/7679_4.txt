Snow White, which has just been released in Locarno, where I had the chance to see it, is of course a reference to the famous fairy tale. And that also refers to coke. Finally, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays its role. <br /> <br /> This is how the three aspects of the title are discussed in this film. There is a lot of dope on the scene and there is also a pale, dark-haired girl - with a prince who has to deal with all sorts of problems to help him. <br /> <br /> But: it's not a fairy tale. It's supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the slogan). <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is almost perfect. Unfortunately, a weak plot, predictable dialogues, a mostly unreal scene and a mixed action game do not help to create authenticity. So, as a spectator, I remained intact. <br /> <br /> And then there were the clich√©s, which drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled upper class girl - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough of love on their part, because they were very busy all the time. Her best friend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a metalworker and a housewife) live in a poor, happy little apartment - and unaware of the desperate situation their daughter is in. The brave boy (= prince) is a musician (!) From French-speaking Switzerland (which is considered as the economically the least prosperous part of the country, but in better emotional condition). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain, who do not seem to accept his unleashed way of life - until the father falls seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from his hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so on: the drug dealer is naturally brutal, the bankers are heartless, the owner of the club is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), has only her career in mind when she exposes Snow White in artistic pornographic images during a show. <br /> <br /> This notice does not need a spoiler to allow you to add these items to an obvious scenario. As I like Samir's other films, for example "Forget Baghdad", I was quite disappointed. Let's hope for the next one.
