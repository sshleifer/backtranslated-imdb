In a word: atrocious. I was advised to read some articles on the philosophical meanings of this film, but after spending every 115 minutes of the film and crashing under its bloated symbolism and oppressive flowing lava, it seemed to me preferable to share my reactions to the film. After all, who will see a movie with a program in hand? And this movie was lamentable. Lead actor Claude Laydu, from the beginning to the end of the film, wears the same annoying and annoying mask of boredom that is almost impossible to distinguish from the film's eternal and bleak voiceover. Filming one on the other might have worked better than submitting an audience to both, because they basically say the same thing: the priest of Ambricourt is a miserable human being. The story of a persecuted priest trying to help a rich and troubled family does nothing to make his characters distant or sympathetic, because the family is a bunch of unpleasant animals, and the priest himself is a curious pest. . The last 30 minutes suggest a breathtaking message about the grace and suffering of a man equal to that of others, but because of all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext of Robert Bresson's text, all what I felt was, well, it's over, let's get some ice cream. Interesting for fans of Paul Schrader, fanatic of Bresson, just to see how many elements of character and Schrader scenery have been integrated into his own scripts and movies, including "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
