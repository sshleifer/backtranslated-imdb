I wanted to love Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia took a bad turn at half of the movie and I was lost. I almost extinguished it at that time and there, but I felt that I had to stay until the end, but I did not know it would be another torturing hour and a half. Thank God, I rented instead of seeing it at the theater. I almost screamed in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the frog scene that was coming to an end. My DVD player still does not forgive me and I do not blame him at all. It was a unique film, but a bad film, boring and useless.
