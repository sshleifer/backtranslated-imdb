All I can say is that before watching the movie, I did not know who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was. was unable to persuade me to search by typing a few words on the Google site; However, all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was great with her dumb facial expression. She played really well and showed a mental state of deep depression, as in reality. the scenario the film happened in Turkey and Tehran as well as in Afghanistan .. but believe me, I know the region well, it was an Arabian desert in Morocco. Turks and Persians are completely different in their own way as well as in a language that is not Arabic. <br /> <br /> I guess to make a movie like this - documentary type - a thorough search of all these minor elements is mandatory ..
