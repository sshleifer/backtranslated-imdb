<br /> <br /> I do not know who decides which category a movie belongs to, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was pretty interesting, but rather slow. However, I was particularly disappointed with the end. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why, on earth, did she run to her uncle (?) Without calling the detective or the police at least on board? She knows exactly what's going on at the moment and she has a videotape as proof. Instead, she runs over there and starts going crazy saying, "I know everything, I have evidence, you did not expect evidence, did you ?!" Then she acts with surprise when her uncle gets up and goes to her as if he is going to hurt her. Well DUH! Of course, he will hurt you, you just told him that you know everything and that you have evidence to reveal everything. What a stupid end.
