The comment of "eliz7212-1" hits the proverb "nail on the head" for this turkey of a program. But it's amusing to watch William Shatner "sing" and "dance" (yes, the "marks" on the word dance are necessary for Bill to do). This show would be a good sketch on SNL or MAD TV - and he attributes a few stars to whoever looks at him, to see Shatner, who seems to have taken "the camp" to new heights - whether in a role or as a himself. . But the guy is funny. <br /> <br /> The girls who are in the area with the game data scrolls will be rather unlucky when this turkey is canceled - unless a strong return of the kind of whiskey-a-go-go, with a resuscitated demand for pretty young women to dance in raised cages once again. <br /> <br /> I watched the first competitor, who was annoying and literally stupider than: post, "yet by pure luck, left with a quarter of a millet or so." The second competitor, a little more smart, but who would be lucky to win $ 1,000 on Jeopardy!, was impressed by the card that requires answering a special question - that he did not know, and so left the zilch. > <br /> This plethora of televised games, which hang out, and sometimes give large sums to ordinary people, is certainly an inexpensive effort, on the whole, to try to seduce the viewers. is well compensated and gives six figures in an average episode, I suppose that the revenue in relation to the costs can be favorable - since you do not have a sitcom distribution where several stars get six or seven figures, per episode, with some big contract s residuals too. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the best will carry fast. This one has already reached this point. I think his offers, especially with James Spader, and others from "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfying amount of Bill Shatner's offers. <br /> <br /> Again, the note above is simply appropriate to see Bill hoot and prance, maybe once; this should be enough.
