The story of this film is very interesting and, in general, the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, realization, continuity, stimulation, action sequences, cascades, use of the CG, ruin and ruin the movie. <First, the action sequences. They are all pretty uninspiring. Most of them consist of a person who is standing and being shot without making any attempt to run, fight, dodge or anything else, even if he has all the time in the world. The footage seems just bland for something that was done in 2004. <br /> <br /> CGIs offer very well rendered and animated effects, but their looks are cheap because of the way they are used. <br /> <br /> Stimulation: everything goes too fast. For example, "She" is trained to fight in a few hours and can, from the start, make back-flips, etc. Why is she so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the film. As Lilith, she would not have needed to go back - maybe she could not, because she had wings. <br /> <br /> We also have sequences like that of a woman getting hit by a car. and getting up and wandering in a deserted room with a sink and a mirror, then stabbing in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really worrying about it coming from being hit by a car (and then feeling the side effects of another car exploding) ... "Are you okay?" asks the driver "yes, that's fine," she said, bloody and disheveled. <br /> <br /> I watched everything, because the introduction had promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, the bad performance made me wish something else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was comical relief, because they had managed to suspend my disbelief, but it just made me want to shake the director, and gives the writer a good conversation.
