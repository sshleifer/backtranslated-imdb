I have always said that some pieces, by their very nature, simply could not be translated into film, and this one is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> This piece is a very funny satire farce of Catholic. church, with a razor spirit and a central character who is so shocking unreal we must take it for root even when she begins to murder her parishioners she sends it directly to heaven). <br /> <br /> It's just an example of how far the play goes beyond reality and in the imaginary world of theater, it works. However, this kind of exaggerated reality rarely works on a movie, and this is certainly not the case here. <br /> <br /> The director Marshall Brickman has assembled a beautiful cast that does a great job, but presenting all this nonsense in a realistic way. Comedy becomes a tragedy and you end up with a feeling of emptiness in the pit of your stomach. <br /> <br /> Look for a production of the play instead, you will not be disappointed.
