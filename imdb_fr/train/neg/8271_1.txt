"Handsome guy with bad haircuts !!" "Beautiful girls without any clue !!" "Silly Gangsters who can not shoot right !!" From the Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama, "Dragon Heat". For reasons that will probably never be completely forgotten, the production and the casting claim this movie of "steroid criminals" that forced Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign as bad guys. But they do not have much to do in this horrible slug festival. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors, each with their own curriculum vitae and list of achievements, and Biehn in particular has had the courage to take on rather difficult and non-heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was the super- "Mai" of "Live Free Gold Die Hard", said so nuff. /> <br /> Biehn is of course famous for being the soldier of tomorrow who made "The Terminator" of 1984 such a credible science fiction / fantasy adventure by crashing against Big Arnold, now the governor of California! ! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost totally lost in this terrible episode of a crime drama. This is absolutely no reason, because the incredibly complicated plot - largely presented in Chinese, being a Hong Kong story - could have been better elaborated for a non-Chinese audience with a foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Biehn had been used as an observer or coordinator of Interpol, or as a concealed agent, who would need an explanation every five or ten minutes, 'was great. But no, he's been incorporated into a strange group of special-force villains who seem to be behind their own corrupt deal, right in the middle of someone else's totally corrupt deal involving the king local corrupt agreements. <br /> <br /> Yes, there, I said everything. Confused? Me too. "Welcome to the party, my friend." <br /> <br /> In Hong Kong's truly superb crime drama, nicknamed by its English title "Breaking News", many fascinating characters are at work, but is only a story in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bad guys against the good cops. In this miserable and excessively violent incursion into the world of a triad or gang of Hong Kong, it seems that the police forces on high heat are only a parade of ducks in a shooting room, in the manner whose criminals shoot them down. So, unsurprisingly, there is an almost incomprehensible scene (several scenes in fact), where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game to win stuffed animal prizes. And so, brave, well-meaning policemen intervene naturally on their behalf, so the owner of the arcade must give up Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also an unenthusiastic attempt to create a "love" one of the visiting cops "and the only" visiting cop "female. <br /> <br /> The cops in visit are supposed to be material witnesses against the gangster leader of the Triad, who is turned away on the way to his appearance in court, but not by his own team, but by the mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q and some others) These killers all want something but we can not know more about what it is before the end of the movie !! It was a stupid mistake in the whole story. <br /> <br /> You can not create suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain, or obtain, or avoid, presented very early in history. <BR/> <br /> Add to that some "cut scenes" made for purely artistic effects, showing all the recent past of the wicked and the wicked, and any moviegoer can easily understand why this barking dog gets a rating of 1 from this fan of all that is cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
