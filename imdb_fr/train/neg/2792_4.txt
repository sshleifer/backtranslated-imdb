STUDIO 666 (aka THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another sub-slasher that looks like a movie directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> While many of the movies on DVD are fast paced or unintentionally hilarious in the good sense of the word, STUDIO 666 is a dismal failure. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this article, each comment on the first page has a negative rating and a negative opinion. . Each of these people put their finger on it. <br /> <br /> Both people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously, they have seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive point I can make about this movie is that it's better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM, two extremely mediocre slasher movies that I would not wish for my worst ennemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this film must have been made hundreds, even thousands of times. The film has only a slight repercussion (and a poorly treated) of the usual expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Not long after, his mind becomes the owner of one of his surviving friends. The said possessed friend launches into a slaughter. The rest of the plot is really too weird to summarize. You will have to see it yourself, provided that your interest is not yet at the point of disappearing, of course. <br /> <br /> In the film, the acting is very mediocre. The actress who played Dora was an exception to that. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on screen. It helps to raise the film over similar contemporary endeavors. Unfortunately, some of the lines that were given to him were poorly written, which prevents him from saving the film. <br /> <br /> The management was just as bad. The perpetrators did not seem threatening at all, each murder was totally devoid of suspense or tension, the atmosphere was non-existent and the work of the camera was incredibly fundamental. Some of the special effects (if you can call them that) reminded me of the TV series GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, GHOST STORIES had cleverly written scripts, credible performances and made great use of camera angles. Maybe if the producers had watched this TV series closely, they could have used other techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> The music is totally unsuited to the tone of the film. It's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either. Do not start on this horrible song that was played in the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, especially the dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they are not amusing enough to move the movie up (or should it be down) to the level so bad-that-it-is-good. <br /> <br /> Overall, STUDIO 666 is a mediocre mediocre slasher with very little merit aspects. I recommend it only to those who like movies directly on DVD and want to see all the slasher movies ever made.
