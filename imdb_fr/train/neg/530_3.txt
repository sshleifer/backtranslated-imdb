I saw it softly two days before the official opening and I must say that I was extremely disappointed. And I must put the majority of these problems on the decision to entrust Claire Danes the lead role. Depending on what you think of the Danes, she was either terribly badly received or so overwhelmed that she should be the favorite of the first edition of the 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we were supposed to be nice to her. Instead, she is completely unfriendly. Other "big" actresses do a good job, but certainly do not light the screen. Among the "big" actresses of this film, I would say that the one who did the best job is Natasha Richardson. Streep is hardly in the picture, and only appears towards the end. <br /> <br /> Horrible scenario too. It's more like a line reading than a real character.
