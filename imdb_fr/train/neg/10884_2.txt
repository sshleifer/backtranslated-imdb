In fact, these young people were so uncomfortable that I could not wait until they were all slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton), because I considered her the most annoying of the group. <br /> <br /> But I knew that the first few minutes would be disastrous when a teenager, Christine, opened fire on the priest and nuns with the music of Leslie Gore in the background. <br /> <br /> Even the prostheses looked like fakes and the "blood" was strangely similar to Hawaiian Punch, although later, it took a red day to look like Halloween's silly makeup. all wore. I'm sure all the dull GOTHs will appreciate this asshole, because he will appeal to this group. I certainly did not like it. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And even my favorite horror girl, Adrienne Barbeau, can not save this stupid teen horror movie by itself. She always looks hot, though. I'm glad she takes care of herself because we do not see her much nowadays. <br /> <br /> However, this is an advance on HORROR (2002), the meander of Dante Tomaselli, in that he has a conspiracy a bit coherent, so I will give it a lot . This and the little Boston Terrier named Boozer also bring him a notch. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa at the end. It was the only good scene in a ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films was surely desperate to have found this one. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
