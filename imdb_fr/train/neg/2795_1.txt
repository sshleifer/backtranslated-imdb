Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in her mouth and blows the back of her head on her boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the singer of a rock band "demons and death" that could not forget the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect towards her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this problem otherwise than 'putting a bullet in your head). . She returns however, having the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend who must replace her to sing so that the band can finish the album stopped by the premature death of Cassidy. But Cassidy has made a pact with Dark One and the souls must be recovered. She is consumed by this anger mainly towards Neal, but all the members of the group or all the members of the music studio are dead when they fall prey to whom Dora..not distraught..not Cassidy coming back to recover her money. <br /> <br /> The tiny horror film and micro-budget looks cheap, it has a cheap distribution that should make projects in another line of work, and has not been effective a bit.
