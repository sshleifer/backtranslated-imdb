They messed up this story! In the end, Nell is all heroic and committed to the team saving all their asses Hill House and a lot of nonsense like that! They added cut heads, threads cutting people's faces and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What is this mess ??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason the original movie and the book are so interesting is that it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no hand on the ceiling. Only in the ghost can ghosts really kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not throw us into the room or stab us in the head. No, they can only drive us crazy. Remove all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She wanted only good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little about others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont laughed at this beautiful story! I hate this damn remake!
