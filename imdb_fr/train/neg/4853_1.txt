I am a big fan of war movies and, as a Vietnam veterinarian, I have some experience of technical details. I have worked with the bomb guys more than once and I have only respect for them. Other veterinarians, especially those from Iraq, have summed up the inaccuracies of this film very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy and fails badly because of it. No demining unit or unit would have ever tolerated this unauthorized operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units attach great importance to compliance and discipline, which saves lives. The opening scene really pissed me off. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Shouting: "Stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly blatant. As others have noticed, your average EOD guy is not aware that Jack is a sniper, and to think that an Arab sniper is so good really excites the imagination. Removing an Arab businessman for a form of personal revenge would not take place. Someone might shoot him, but that kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies. I could go on, but as I said, others have outlined these things in detail. It's not a good movie, and if it wins any prize, it's a further reflection of why "La La Land" has that name.
