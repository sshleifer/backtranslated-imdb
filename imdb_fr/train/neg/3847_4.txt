Helen has a lot of problems and nothing good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play the mothers of two Leopold and Loeb, killers who travel from the Midwest to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, an aspiring Jean Harlow, opens a children's dance studio and Winters is his pianist. Soon, winters (like Helen) start to crack. Everything is very slow and although there are moments of real goosebumps (wicked phone calls, a visit from wino Timothy Carey), the film is devoid of any horror. Nevertheless, it remains a worthy entertainment. The acting divas are doing well and the production values ​​are excellent. The score of David Raskin, the cinematography of Lucien Ballard and the Oscar nominated costumes contribute greatly. With that, PLACE AU SUN and LOLITA to his credit, is anyone as crazy as Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master of this type of exploitation not quite a movie. In addition to Carey, Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as a beloved evangelist of Aimee Semple McPherson), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (Irishman Orson Welles), as well as Hamilton Starr, are nicknamed the group.
