I would not bring a child under 8 to see him. While the puppies hang from the buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's scary laughter to name a few of the events, the suspense is simply too suspensive for a small child. <br /> <br /> The live action gives a more disturbing sensation than the comic version and there are a lot of disturbing moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that worry you and can scare little children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the Disney people thought, but neither the story nor the actors' game matched their usual level. Puppies are cute But this film is at best irregular.
