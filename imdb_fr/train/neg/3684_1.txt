They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but I found it pretty funny (comedy, do not believe me), I laughed at the entire movie, I think it was because of the ridiculous game and the plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy" I loved his role in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! she is a beautiful actress and a good actress too, but let's try to be a small goal here, the story mm mm ... the direction mm mm ... it lacks a lot of good suspense, in fact it's a really boring movie, but there is a good thing, it's a short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me, it was like 10 minutes underwater !!!) <br /> <br /> > I do not know why this film is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what is wrong with a good, rational and objective criticism?
