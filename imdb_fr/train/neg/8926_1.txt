I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when he first came out in 1970. I was 20 years old and I was in good health at the time. I loved movies and I really liked Raquel Welsh. On top of that, I had read Gore Vidal's novel on which he was based and I found it very funny. I saw the film at a local drive-in and about midway through, I was very tempted to turn on the engine of my car so that I might die of poisoning with monoxide and that I do not have to see the rest of the sinking of a film. . It was not "smart" or "hip", it was rude and neglected. All the actors were a bit deaf and the director had no idea what he was doing. Mae West's cast was one of the worst casting choices in film history. As one critic says, its role has nothing to do with the film or the book. His character in the book is beaten sexually by the young stallion, which would never do the trick of the legendary Mrs. West. Oh no, the plot has changed, so she beats it sexually, which is very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a horrible film. <br /> <br /> Bluto
