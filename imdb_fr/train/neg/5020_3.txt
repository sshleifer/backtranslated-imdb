It's the most messy entry on IMDb that I have not discovered yet. All previous reviews act as if it was the movie. It's not the film. It's more like a simple feature on the DVD of the movie "The One". The 90 minutes for which it is mentioned here are far from equivalent. In fact, it's just over 13 minutes that Jet Li is able to practice martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So yes, this entry IMDb is a bit fubar. Do not listen to other critics because they are all wrong. You can trust me because I have never fed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> and that's the truth. I guess you can say that I am the unique "critic" who counts.
