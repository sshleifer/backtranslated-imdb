THIS FILM IS BLADE, BLADE, BLADE !!!!! It takes a lot of things for me to make myself too exaggerated about a movie, but this movie has the stench of my house !! I have not even finished the film yet and had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is. I have never done that !! As a consumer, do not spend your money on this movie. Wait until it goes on a cable channel or something. It's barely worthy of television. I really hate TRASHING a movie, but this movie is TRASH! Barely above porn. Should have and X rating! Good plot, a bit of frontal nudity (if it floats your boat), but HORRIBLE secondary level. I do not know how this film was distributed. (This must be contractual.) Really, if you really like watching good movies, do not waste your time with this one. From one cinema lover to another. YOU WILL BE MAD TO YOURSELF! Let me say this too, if you have experienced something like that, maybe you can understand it and it will have some value for you. In this case, I beg you to look, you can get something out of it, if not just to see something that has happened to you and that is being played by someone else (has therapeutic value).
