The good guys in the Webster dictionary define logophobia as "fear of words". I may be just logophobic. Because no combination of words makes me more afraid than at the beginning of a movie, the credits contain the words "Product, written and directed by:", followed by the name of a single individual. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but there is so little jack-of-all trades. Even the most seasoned filmmakers like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take control of their films. But I was there, all tucked into my theater seat, the popcorn in hand and about to watch the Order when it was launched to me like a fastball Nolan Ryan, were the words "Product, Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland ". Whoa! <br /> <br /> Being a movie buff, I knew Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his filmography over the last 10 years would be illustrated as the stock price of the dotcom company in 1998. River). They seemed to alternate ?? a good one, a bad one, so knowing that his latest film, BloodWork was one of the most futile efforts of Clint Eastwood's career, I caught my breath and hoped for the best. In hindsight, I should not have expired. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger (The Tale of the Helgeland Knights) is the order of the Order in the role of Alex Bernier, a priest in an order known as Carolingians, who is summoned to Rome when Another priest is killed in circumstances such as the Bishop Bow deems "curious". Meeting Father Thomas (also of the Order and played wonderfully by Mark Addy of Still Standings), they undertook to reconstruct the enigma left behind by the priest's premature death. Complicating things is a conspiracy involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who escaped an institution resulting from her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings for Mara and for some reason unknown to the public, they go to Rome together. <br /> <br /> Nary has a good night's sleep and Alex is confronted by William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann) who claims to be a centuries-old sin-eater. As we say, the sin-eaters are those who devour the sins of a dying individual while the church does not, thus allowing entry into the sky. William, by chance, is tired of a life of healing and seeks Alex to assume his role and free him from his worldly duties. Alex hesitates, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex resorts to the ritual of the Sin Eater to save it and the transformation is complete. Alex then looks for answers to his many questions as Father Thomas unveils the Vatican plot behind the transfer of authority to his fellow investigator. <br /> <br /> The order is not a terrible film, but it's terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - that of Alex walking on Mara's death - she is pale and bland and leaves us no emotional reaction to the couple's difficult situation. Everyone seems to be talking so softly and emotionlessly that flat lines and salts that smell of the film could have been used to stop me from trying to take a nap in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgeland, I'm begging you not to do it again. Share your vision with others and allow those who are more experienced to help you navigate in less narrow and selfish ways. Until then, nothing indicates that you are capable of anything other than a failure. Two stars. <br /> <br />
