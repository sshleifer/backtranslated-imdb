I did not know much about this movie until I saw it, but I heard that it had something to do with quantum physics and that it interested me. What I did not know is that it's not really a story, but a group of New Age blowhards who like the sound of their own voice, talking about the fact that they know very little about the basic quantum mechanics. I say that it belongs more to the documentary category than to comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the film, to give this New Age Symposium * a kind of scenario. His parts of the film feel horribly attached and are meant to display the speaker's thoughts so that we do not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie who hangs on her couch. We come to listen to unnamed people who discuss what "quantum physics" means to them. The only good thing about this movie was the Indian speaker (I guess), but I think he ran for the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Looks like Barbara Eden really let herself go and she continued on how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs. It seems that Quark DS9 has little money and also makes a brief appearance in the film. There is a lot of CGI whizbang that should impress us; cells in the body are shown as dancing jello mussels, because the filmmakers apparently saw Flubber once too much. <br /> <br /> People in the film say that the Arawaks of San Salvador thought that the Columbus ship, the Pinta, was invisible. because the natives had never seen ships to be clipped before, as if people now had the least way of knowing it. Of course, they omit all this information and are content to say "the Columbus ships were invisible to the American Indians". The film makes many arrogant jumps. Around 1855, Thomas Young performed a double slot experiment and discovered that light could sometimes look like a particle and a wave. Of course, you would never know by watching this stupid film, because the only reference to it is that "atoms can be particles and waves". And that must mean that people can get through the walls, walk on the water and never get old if they want! Then I'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she * believed * loud enough. I am sarcastic, but this film is filled with false hopes and beliefs that the people who marry them do not really care. <br /> <br /> These are New Age kooks who have clung to the theory of the theory of theory theory of the theory of the theory of quantity theory, as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snake oil sellers really believed the shit they were selling, could not they just * wish * that their paycheck exists instead of appearing in that movie joke? We are fortunate enough to listen to another unnamed man, without any title we know, talk on his sofa in front of a fireplace (or a TV screen) the way he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen, I wanted someone to rush to throw a pie in his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Another bald guy in costume says that no one really touches anything because a magnetic force prevents him at the quantum level. If only someone had walked on the screen and continued to hit him in the belly shouting "I do not touch you! I do not touch you!" A moral relativist in the film says that there is really "no good or bad". So, apparently, it is normal that Hitler gassed millions of Jews? Another person says there is "no love". It's just a chemical and we really do not like people, we're just addicted to the rush of chemicals that we have when we're dealing with them. I suspect this guy is doing this movie as a service to the community for his addiction to heroin for so many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults are walking around a wedding reception seeing RoboCop. They evaluate whether the women are cows, dogs or foxes, and a sexual position appears on the scree. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she is supposed to be photographing and the next day she decides to love herself and take a bath because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that the film says that people often find evidence their preconceived notions. Maybe in this review, I only see what I want to see, but I REALLY wanted to see these people taking pies in their faces, and that never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have not heard of any of the ideas presented in the previous movie, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to watch a good film about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, go see the man who was not there. If you want to read a good book on quantum field theory, read Michio Kaku's Hyperspace. If you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals, check out Waking Life (although it may seem boring, important, and pretentious at the same time). All in all, you should go read Robert Anton Wilson's Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising instead of wasting your time on this film. <br /> <br /> Normally, I have a hard time giving the movies a score ranging from 1 to 10, but this one was very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is true. People in this movie do not know # $ *! Without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.
