It's probably one of the worst killer animal movies I've ever seen. This is the typical principle of a laboratory experiment that went awry and blew a giant crocodile containing a fast-growing chemical. The monster looks very much like a dinosaur, with large hind legs resembling Tyranosaurus, while it should look like an oversized crocodile. Everything in this film is not original and it slips constantly "cliche" minute after minute. Why are there still two drunken huntsmen outside after dark that are separating? In addition, there is always a guy and a girl who share an obvious and lame love interest while they are in a situation where their life is in danger. Too many things have already been said by me and I feel like wasting my time writing this ...
