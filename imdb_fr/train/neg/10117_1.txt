Sensational. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found that little gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it just looked like the movie for my mood. I brought it home and I put it on. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the Horror B movie I had in mind. It was much worse. I wanted a bad movie but what I got, I did not know that such bullshit existed in humans. This film seemed to be a young man of 5 years who wrote and directed it. It's nice about it. <br /> <br /> I'm a budding director and this movie has made me so crazy that someone has actually paid the price for direct movies. He has to work at the garbage dump shoveling shit in his place. <br /> <br /> If you plan to rent or buy it. I'll tell you the same thing I would say to someone who is about to commit suicide. "DO NOT DO IT, IT IS NOT VALUE!" I really have nothing nice to say about this movie. DO NOT DO IT!
