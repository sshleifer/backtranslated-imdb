- Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was a parody of the science fiction movies of the 1950s. I understand that none of this should be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of this works. A parody should be funny and this one just is not. Not once during the whole execution, I did not smile. In general, I'm easily entertained, but I did not find any piece of entertainment in Invasion of the Star Creatures. <br /> <br /> - I knew I had problems right from the start. The two "stars" make their appearance on the screen with one of the darkest gags that can be imagined - a hose that they can not control that both wet. These two present themselves as aspirants to the Bowery Boys. Why anyone who wants to mimic the act and personality of the Bowery Boys is beyond me. After less than iconic beginnings, the films feature comic chases, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoding rings, and other non-funny pieces. It's a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought it on the dual function DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. This film has been awarded at the Oscars against Invasion of the Star Creatures.
