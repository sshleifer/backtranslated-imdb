He has often been voted China's best film by Chinese critics, as well as by Chinese film fans from the outside, and frankly, I do not understand at all. What I have seen is one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, directed and played furtively, with a complete tune for a protagonist. Wei Wei (do not laugh) is this shrew, a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tuberculous husband (Yu Shi) in recent years. We are post-WWII and they live with the teenage sister of the husband (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house with little money (the man was rich when they got married). Then comes the husband's old best friend (Wei Li), who was also the woman's boyfriend when they were teenagers. She plans to flee her husband with this man, while the husband remains almost unconscious, thinking that he could engage his little sister with his friend. It's the configuration, and it's not going anywhere where you do not expect it. I actually saw the remake, directed by the director of Blue Kite, Zhuangzhuang Tian. It takes half an hour longer and is actually pretty boring, but at least it was pretty. This supposed classic is quite intolerable.
