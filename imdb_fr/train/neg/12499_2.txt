I went to the film as a preview in Austria. So, I had no idea what I'm going to see. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I think it could have been reduced to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story. This is the type of movie you can see on a boring night and you want to get bored! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is fine. The film talks about US coastguards, how they are trained, their lifestyle and the issues they face. Since there are not many effects in the film. So, if you want to watch it, you do not need to waste your time and money going to the movies. Would be more effective to watch at home when it is on DVD.
