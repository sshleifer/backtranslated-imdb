I had the misfortune to watch this waste on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies because most of them are just rubbish. This one is even worse: it's one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in my life. Horror movie? Yes, there are some horrible things in this: the acting, the script and the special effects - My God, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a movie for 90 minutes. In fact, if it had been a comedy film, I would have given it a 5. Do not you even think of praising this unless you want to make fun of the producers? <br /> <br /> Vote: 2 out of 10 - I did not vote because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
