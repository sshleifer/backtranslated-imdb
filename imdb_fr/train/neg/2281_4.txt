Think "theater game". It's worth seeing once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Compile Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with the Melvyn DOuglas of this movie. Are there free vampires in this "Bavarian" village or is there a more natural, though equally sinister explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is portrayed as a particularly weak character. It's fun to watch her different facial expressions in what is really a stock character. Not much has happened in a long time, but then we discover that Atwill's pipe smoker is the real murderer. There is too much "comical relief", but it is quite normal for this time. Fay Wray looks really good.
