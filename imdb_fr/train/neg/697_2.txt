The two things that are good in this movie are his unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and flexible, with looks that still surround her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all that she is, and that's it. Obviously, she's just starting out because her acting has improved with her next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the score of the then known composer, Christopher (Chris) Young, is what prevents this stinky from getting a star ... yes, I know that one more star is not much, but in the case of this film, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just a stupid absurd horror of a couple of students trying to clean a dormitory is due to the fact that it was demolished, that an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah, one by one ... we all know where this is going. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
