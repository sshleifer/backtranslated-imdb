I will go to the movie in a minute. First, someone wanted "proof" of what Clinton said in Georgetown, where he said the United States "deserved" the 9-11 attacks. This is what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "At the first crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned down a synagogue in which 300 Jews were lying, and then killed all the women and all the Muslim children on the Temple Mount, I can tell you that this story is still told in the Middle East and we always pay the price. "<br /> <br /> WE still pay for it "Whaddya means" we ", pale face? The Marines have not stormed the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in truth, Clinton never really went out and said categorically that we "deserved" on September 11. Like all his statements during his presidency, he IMPLIED that we deserved September 11. Just point out the "facts" A, B, C and maybe D, and leave the listener deduce that they have to add up to conclusion X. In truth, most of the "facts" of Clinton's addition are born with guacamole. <br /> But it's next to the point. We are here to talk about films, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can not escape his twisted politics. It was only a matter of time before he concentrated his paranoia and bitterness on the Reagan era. What a better time than when Stone almost realized his dreams, the day Reagan nearly bought the farm. Unable to find conspiracies or harmful ploys in Hinckley's assassination attempt, he invents one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority, Haig is transformed into an official who really should have turned his civic action into a delusional megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands like Montgomery Burns and tell Cape Weinberger to "free the dogs". Stone recruits even the most experienced person in Hollywood to interpret our former Secretary of State, Richard Dreyfuss. A guy you like to hate on sight. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is OK. Average, below average. Do not bother renting or buying. Try to catch it on the cable. 4 out of 10
