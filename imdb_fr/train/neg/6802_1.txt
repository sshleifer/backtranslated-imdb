Words can not describe how bad this movie is. I can not explain it by writing only. You too, see for yourself to understand how horrific a film can be. Not that I recommend you do it. There are so many clich√©s, mistakes (and all the negative things you can imagine) that will make you cry. To begin with the technique, there are MANY errors concerning the plane. I will not list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They did not even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but rather used a painted 747 in Boeing's original livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, but much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count very early on. Besides, I was always on the side of the bad guys in the movie, because the good ones were so stupid. "Executive decision" should definitely be your choice in relation to this one, even the "Turbulence" movies are better. In fact, all other movies in the world are better than this one.
