this movie was not absolutely atrocious, but it was really bad. the acting was really good! Jeffrey combs did a damn good job as a mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you do not know it: D. bill forsythe .. well, I'm not exactly sure why he was in this movie. He is too good for this kind of thing and his role was not really demanding. I praised this with the strength of these two leaders and I was not really disappointed. I mean, damn it, it's a movie about a half-man / half-shark. These are not the people of Shakespeare. Besides the intrigue, which is full of holes, and the mediocre dialogue, I would like to note that cinematography also left much to be desired. there were shots where they tried to look "cool", but that ended up obscuring the scene or just falling out. they also failed repeatedly when they had a decent dialogue and cut off prematurely before the person could even deliver the line. it was bad enough. but if you're a fan of Jeffrey's combs, this one is worth the detour. he gives an excellent performance and does what he can with the character. because it's not bad either, nor one of the two women. Hell if I can remember his name though. In the end, I will not waste your time otherwise.
