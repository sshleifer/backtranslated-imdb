I tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot movie, first on VHS and then on DVD. However, I could not get into this story because his two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to be in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit that there was a clever dialogue in the programs, which was a key element in the success of the TV show, and I really appreciated that dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, it was almost like in the old comedy movies of the 30s and 40s with a man against a woman. You have a lot of talk, accusations, shouting and shouting. Apparently, a lot of people like this kind of quarrel, but I hate it, so I never got involved in the Moonlighting movement. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as unfortunate help "Agnes" was fun. It's a pity she had so little airtime. Shepherd was kind to the eyes and I guess women would say the same thing to Willis, but too much discussion between the two ends up deterring me.
