Without a doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women driven to rob banks with which we are supposed to sympathize. It is difficult to sympathize with characters who continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops are ours, they know who we are, what are we doing? ... Destroy another bank, we left! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it's easy to say who will finish death.
