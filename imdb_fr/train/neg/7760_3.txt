In Fiji, the avaricious and unscrupulous owner of Primal Valalola invites investors and guests to an opening night of his complex, consisting of a hotel and a zoo, to find partners for his discoveries . When a group of small university thieves put a virus in the security system to participate in a treasure hunt, the biggest attractions of the zoo? Sabretoothes of the prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils ?? escape, kill hosts and guards for your pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredibly lame and cheap attack is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. The characters are awful and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible scam at Jurassik Park with a bad collection of clich√©s. Basically, all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the saber teeth are bulimic and like to kill for fun. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("The Attack of the Sabraces")
