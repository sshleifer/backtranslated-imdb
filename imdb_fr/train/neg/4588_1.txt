I created my own reality by leaving the theater where my girlfriend had made me go to this brothel with her mother. We (my friend and I) went out about an hour. What is a load of pseudoscientific jargon of the new age? <br /> <br /> Subatomic particles are thoughts? By sticking labels on water bottles and blessing them with a Buddhist monk, he formed beautiful crystals? A 25% drop in the murder rate in Washington occurred when a group of people meditated. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone ate cheerios for four days in a row at the same time. Should we conclude that eating cheerios has led to a drop in the murder rate? <br /> <br /> Crap, hooey, pucky bull! <br /> <br /> BTW- It was funded by the Ramtha cult, whose leader was one of the "experts" interviewed by the filmmakers. No ulterior motives here, no?
