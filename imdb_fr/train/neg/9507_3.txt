I am always frustrated with movies that have been written by one sex. Especially when they obviously do not do enough research to know when something does not sound right, but sounds blatantly. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom where Jack is telling his football teammates that he put Diane in the pot. In any case, one guy could not encourage another boy to put a pregnant girl in high school. They might applaud that the guy has slept with the hot cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the football team did not hear about it for the first time. It certainly would not be a urinal. Do not take it seriously, and it was not terribly bad, but come on!
