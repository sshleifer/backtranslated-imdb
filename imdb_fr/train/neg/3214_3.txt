First of all, I would like to tell you that I am a fan of comics, animes, animations, etc. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. I will be objective. To start with the story, it's okay. Follow the story of comics to the extent that I know them well. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's really cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and did not stick to the original cartoon style drawings. If we claim not to see the rare neglected effects like fire and lightning, you could say that the film was shot about 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original 1985 V Dampire Hunter D. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, for example - 4 years ago, they made a movie that looks a lot better! In addition to that, the vocal talents do not do anything remarkable, the music is nothing special. So overall, it lacks atmosphere. I watched it, but I can not say I really enjoyed it. It just does not catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. It may be shocking for someone who has never watched more mature animations and who sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), But I do not think so. that this is the audience of this movie. So, they could add some nudity and spice to that. The chicks around Lucifer were rather tasty, and damn it, we have Lady Death herself! There are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would be better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all, the movie is not that bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Fire and Ice by Ralph Bakshi or Wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
