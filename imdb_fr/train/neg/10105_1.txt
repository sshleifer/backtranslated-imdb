Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I got bored. I looked in my little comcastic box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. The filmmaker has a kind of cult in the description. It's funny how it does not warn me not to watch this movie. I could have used this advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is like Troll 2 in that it is completely nicknamed. This has little (if any, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and takes place in the same city. This film is about a crooked policeman, who acts as badly as he can (he must try to suck him so much), while he stops women for insignificant crap and then kills them. Yes, he's a serial killer policeman. Not only does this movie have a flaw in thinking that it's a zombie movie, but it also gets totally wrong facts. Serial killers love to kill, they live for it and they feel bad with them. This guy stuns women and injects them with poison. He did not even sleep with the corpse or dismember him. Talk about boring! Finally, one of the five huge women he kills is protected by Voodoo and, for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and decide to kill him. They've all been buried or thrown into the sea, but you would not know he's buying the clean, sharp clothes they all wear. The women then act very badly and take revenge. Oh yes. <br /> <br /> This movie was crap in all categories. Shit game, shitty writing, more gloomy decorations and more gloomy make-up effects. Women do not look like zombies, unless you consider a very dark makeup around the eyes as the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all talk, behave, think and act in a perfectly human way. Gore is weak compared to many PG-13 movies and nudity is beyond brief. You see a preview of the breasts in the opening sequence ... Then the same breasts later! Go understand. I guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this banal. The police station is so badly built that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse in which they visibly film. You can see the pipes, insufficient lighting and the configuration is too sparse and even unless you are blind. you can see the director fail. Avoid, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
