I found this on the set while remaining silent and bored. How can people give a 10? It's not fair that it's supposed to be a well-meaning buy movie (I think), because it does not work at that level either. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible game; there is nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent but has nothing to do, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are simply terrible. The progression of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to go in a certain way and did it, without actually writing the bits needed to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but you'll never get 90 minutes of your life.
