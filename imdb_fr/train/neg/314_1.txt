I bought this film for $ 5 in a discount bookstore, Adam Sandler is a great actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it was not. There was absolutely no story at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The word-F" with every word he said, curse did not usually bother me, but it was above. And even worse than the lack of intrigue in the movie, Sandler was just starting to talk on camera. It reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turned to the screen to ask you questions. And finally, they randomly put pictures of girls randomly in the movie by Bikini. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's a waste of money
