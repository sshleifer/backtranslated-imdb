I have a great tolerance for the strange, but frankly, some movies go far beyond strange - until now, they hurt your brain. It's such a movie. Trying to understand or even explain it is impossible and I think the best thing is to understand the film while taking drugs - it's also incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very cute Japanese animation featuring a cat. However, unexpectedly, tons of twisted and sometimes disturbing things happen - making me wonder if I lose something in the translation. However, even if this is the case, why do we need to be treated with images of a magic trick involving the dismemberment of a lady with a malignant, defecation, vomiting, lighting a fire by animals, etc. All this seemed really random and quite terrible. Oddly, and I do not know why, some see it as a genius job. I do not understand that.
