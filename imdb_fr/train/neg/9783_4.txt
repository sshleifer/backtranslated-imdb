Not the worst movie I've seen but certainly not very good either. I am a paintball player myself, I often played airball and switching from wood to airball is a big change. The film depicts similar qualities. First of all, the film starts with this team that apparently tries to film this guy "Phantom" or whatever, she seems to be a professional team and wears a jersey and shoots a mag, an automatic cassette. A guy wearing a bushy. Not much wrong in the film but especially how it is perceived, it's very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are good guys are woodsball players who do not seem to have a lot of money and dream of having "better guns". Another team chooses them and insults them constantly because they play wood and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah <br /> <br /> What is so the problem with the movie? Well, the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie would not be bad, but the budget is rather low and the film feels like it was shot by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is also very bad. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all that other bullshit. It was, in my opinion, an ugly film and it does not give a real perception of what paintball is. To be honest, the real paintball is not quite my buddy, it's a lot of jubilation and bonuses, no "respect" and respect for the rules. Do not watch this movie and expect to go on a pitch shouting "4 is 1 !!"
