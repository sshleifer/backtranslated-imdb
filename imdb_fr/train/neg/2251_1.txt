Really a bunch of amazing dad! <br /> <br /> A predictable film that moves slowly, destroys the soul and numbs the spirit, to which it seems to cut your wrists with a rusty bread knife ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> play is over for the thin dialogue, each scene is at least twice as long as needed, the intricate details of the collapse or progression of this career are far too dreary and banal for words. The music would be good if you did not have to watch the movie, but in reality, three good songs are not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I prayed to God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, ever.
