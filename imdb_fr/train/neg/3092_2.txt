If films like Ghoulies tear up Gremlins, then Hobgoblins will sink into the new wave of scams like Ghoulies. These barely animated furbies have some sort of system for making fantasies (which basically involve sexual dreams of grotesque characters - oh joy), but what this has to do with anything is to guess, except to let the director indulge in his vicious leaning for Erotica. They show it in the 8th circle of hell, we suspect. There is no real plot - just "goblins - kill!" and weak attempts at humor and a slight attempt to stir up the audience.
