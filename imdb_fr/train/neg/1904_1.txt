=== minor spoilers === <br /> <br /> I am, like many others, a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters on the front and the trailer was coming before MI: 2, expectations were high. A production of Jerry Bruckheimer. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh out of an Oscar- Angelina Jolie. What can possibly go wrong? A lot. <br /> <br /> The script is neither funny (it really tries to be difficult) nor exciting. You play as a black man who constantly makes racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa !! you have comedy? I do not think so. The excitement is totally out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said many times), there is no nice character, so who cares who is killed? If you can support the assumption that a psychopath is going to kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, you now know that Kip (the brother) is walking with Nic again on the streets. Is it excitement? Do not think. Then comes the best piece - the romance between Nic and Angelina. In fact, she seems bored to have to say all those stupid lines to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone? 'What did not go well?' etc. <br /> <br /> All that remains is a spark of hope: the car continues. They are disappointing, because the trailer looked like it was full, and there is only one. A very long, caught in a restless and irritating camera movement. I really struggled to follow the action. <br /> <br /> So, is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - There is no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I will give 3 stars out of 10, and I feel generous.
