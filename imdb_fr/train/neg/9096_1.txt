I think it's probably one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get the "same characters" with different people is * a * bad * idea. If they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this one, they would have just had to reduce their losses and get nothing back. Instead, they get NEW actors who are awful to what they did. I felt seriously as if I was at a high school or a (bad) college with the actor lever put forward by these people. <br /> <br /> Where do they find some of these people? Was it their first movie? It really looked like that. <br /> <br /> This film is also parallel to the original in a few lines of speech. I was just watching the first movie and showing up number 2. I was excited to watch the second one, and it was the worst show I've seen in a while. I NEVER * ever * ever * close a movie, but it has been permanently turned off after about 30 to 40 minutes.
