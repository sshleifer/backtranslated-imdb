My teacher filmed this and we showed it in Child Care to show how teenage pregnancy affects people. It showed how teenage pregnancy affected a juvenile boy who was poorly informed about how sex works, and a weeping, unloved girl who throws fruit in anger and who could not say that she was with the wrong man, even if he had a sign saying he was such. I would not be surprised if the baby's father had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's mother (the baby's carrier) is a riot. She is unaware of the fact that her daughter is over four years old and does not seem upset when people spy on her from the dining room window. Bobby's best friend (father), Dewey, is an obvious scam of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This film is horrible, simply because none of the characters are credible. Fortunately it is only for television, which limits the chances of the public to watch it.
