Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Leoni tea? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watering. I gave up everything to watch this movie on Cable. After 30 minutes, I struggled to stay awake. After 60 minutes, I pressed the record button and fell asleep. No more watching it the next morning. I should not have bothered. What a loss of an excellent cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "Day in the Life ..." Heal your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. Horrible dialogue. Continuity nonexistent. The work with the camera could have been done with a Super 8 hand and would have looked better. <br /> <br /> This film was a total disaster.
