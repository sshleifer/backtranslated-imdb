Some people say that larrikin's jokes and Steve Irwin's gregarious personality are just an act. Watch this movie: it is obvious that he can not play. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, star of the dangerman small screen in his series * Crocodile Hunter Diaries *, * Croc Files * and the eponymous series * Crocodile Hunter * (see you a naming trend here, or is it just me?), unravels his character bigger than this on the big screen with * Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course * (yeah? there's a definite trend of words starting with 'C') - Basically, an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * crushed with a movie B. <br /> <br /> In mission to move a big crocodile to prevent him from being shot by an eccentric peasant (Magda Szubanski), Steve and his wife Terri ignore that the croc is hunted by American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom), in order to recover a satellite spy tag that she swallowed. Will it hurt my credibility to say "They are about to collide with a delusion"? (What credibility? - Note Ed.) <br /> <br /> The plot has no relevance, because it is the animal magnetism of Steve that propels the film. If you find his personality tempting, the movie is a failure, but if you're a fan of him (businessman, environmental advocate or just idiot) or his TV shows, expect the same thing in the same way. budget of the screen. <br /> <br /> John Stainton, loyal liege, best companion and director of the crocodile hunter * (can you call it face-up?), writes and leads with the same provincial fanatic Steve a domestic buffoon. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing aspect of this film is that Steve (one of the few people you can actually hear the exclamation marks while he's talking) and Terri (Steve's wife 10 years, the fiercest ally and closest friend of the world) treat her as if it were one of their documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and speaking directly to the camera, while all the other characters behaved as if they were in a bad movie (well ??). It would not be so incongruous that Steve and Terri are separated from the rest of the characters ?? but when the Bad Americans constantly threaten Steve's life, we confuse the viewers, we have to ask ourselves why the indifferent film crew does not call at least the cops if it does not try to catch the bad guys in the eyes with the microphones boom, or running screaming bush ?? do not do anything but keep filming with a lot of lighting, a clean sound and seven angles of action. <br /> <br /> While Terri is unjustly painted in a slightly incompetent Steve's sidekick (his game consists of audaciously incompetent line readings and a parry in pear-sized jeans - for the last one I do not complain), Steve goes about his usual business of showing stories with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts himself because, for him, these are not really stunts, but one day at the office. <br /> <br /> Of course, watching the adventures of this crazy koo-koo after his tragic death in September 2006 throws a strange detachment on the procedure. But for those of us who have never met, this kind of malerkey (as well as various incarnations of the ever-reviving series * Crocodile Hunter *) keeps it as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. The heartbreaking reality of his absence will be visible only by his relatives. And I sincerely wish them the best to follow his tracks outside norms? <br /> <br /> Then enjoy this diversion for what it is ?? a half-cooked film with a complete caption. He died doing what he loved ?? interact with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film by representing him.
