I bought this (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title "Gray Matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a role other than DukesOfHazzard intrigued me. As other critics have warned, this is a pretty boring story of a very secretive government experience that went wrong. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are many successful shots, including that of a house with a pool. Some of the characters and interiors are so innocuous that the filmmakers feared they did not know who they are, so they continue to warn us by showing the outside of the buildings first. It's actually quite funny. After a while, the image of the pool resembles that of the identification logo of a TV channel, reminding us that we are looking at "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two scandal hits. At one point, an angry subject makes fun of the manager by calling her "scientist". It's just a very inadequate insult. Several scenes later, a different subject breaks up by muttering about "scientist b ** late!". It seemed very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will disappear forever. In 10 years, it will probably be impossible to find a copy. Almost as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br />
