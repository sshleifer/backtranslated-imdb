First, I'm not really a fan of this kind of movie, but I'm a bad movie lover and my neighbor next door said he had the worst movie of all time. That one. So we start to watch it. First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder without a tripod! Second, the voice of the lean white doctor is doubled by a big black man! Third, no dialogue makes sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and imprinted with mediocre makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe that the director (and my neighbor) needs psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes but it ages quickly. It's so amateurish that it's like watching a high school video directory badly dubbed ... with zombies. A note to everyone involved in this film - I want the 20 minutes of my life spent watching that, before falling asleep.
