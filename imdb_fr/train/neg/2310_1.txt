It was a really tasteless movie. The representations are third-order and the dialogue is so tense that it sometimes seems to have turned upside down and gone out. The reason for my rental was simple: find a movie with script writing. I needed a visual aid for my presentation, so I thought why not use a clip? The boy was I was wrong. After a search in my local video store, I came across this one, where he was nicknamed "Starstruck". I thought, "What's up?" And decided to give it a try. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. There may have been a scene that I could use, and in the meantime, I practically fell asleep because of the banality of the movie. So ..... I took this again and took Ed Wood. There is a movie that I can use as an example. Again, everything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is "Starfucker".
