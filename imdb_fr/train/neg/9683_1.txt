I give this pretentious waste a 1 simply because I do not believe there is a worse film in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, I hate role play, dialogue, settings, writing and direction. I hope all the people involved in this film burn and decompose in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Curse this disgusting waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this film just a product of my imagination. I pray that I will dream the movie and never have to see it again in my local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
