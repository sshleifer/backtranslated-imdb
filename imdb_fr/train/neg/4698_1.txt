I mean seriously which band would sing about a crazy car? So what if their ten, it's far too immature for a little child to sing on "being my women" I mean seriously! The name is pretty lame too, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants ??? I do not understand why they need a TV show. I mean, most artists do not really need a TV show about themselves, especially the naked brothers group. Heck how many of them are in the freaking group. And seriously what is with the film? Jeez Nick used to be the highlight of my years growing up but seriously of the naked brother group? So many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the Naked Brother band's name, it's a stupid, non-creative show that should not be broadcast on television.
