Everyone said that the movie Tashan would be a good movie with a lot of fun, but that's not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a big mistake as actress Kareena Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the movie. His boyish look is not really good. Even the movie The story of the film does not make sense at all. Everyone said that India's Taratino Quetin is Vijay but that's not Quetin at all. The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this silly movie. Anil is a great actor and this film is not. Akshay Kumar was also a victim of this movie because everything is Saif. The style and Phoormola is not really good in this movie, I was disappointed
