Mulva is put in a sugar by Teen Ape. When she wakes up, she is considerably warmer (the roles played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel), and wants to take revenge on those who have done wrong. As the subtitle and the drawing-box imply that it is indeed a takeoff of the films of "Kill Bill", but as it is a film of Chris Seaver, it is about an extremely incompetent satire (and I use this last term extremely flexibly). Say it's better than the first movie, but to tell the truth, I saw the previous movie so much that it was drunk, that I can not even hope to compare the two at this point. But I must have liked it since I bought the suite (see when I'm drunk, I like, for lack of a better word, complete movies and totally crap) There are a few moments of laughter (very little ) but I remember Bonejack being funnier though. Well at least a little over an hour, it's pretty fast for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> My note: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Audio commentary from director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon and gang Lbp; Seaver's second comment; 31 minutes of shooting the featurette; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute tribute to low-budget photos; Commercial false syrup 2 minutes; picture gallery; Promo trailer; and trailers for: Mulva ", 'The Quest for Egg Salad', 'Fiilthy McNasty' 1, 2, & 3; "The Feral Man", "The Bonesetter", "Midnight Skater", "Demon Summer" and "Splatter Rampage Wrestling"
