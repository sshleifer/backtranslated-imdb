I'll never know how this movie escaped the anger of MST3K. "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action movie, filled (or is it empty?) With thin intrigues, stupid characters and absurd situations. But believe me, if you like to watch mediocre and clumsy films, you will enjoy the "Gymkata". <br /> <br /> The action takes place around a gymnast chosen by the government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see, his father was another quasi-government agent, missing as part of this game, eloquently called "The Game". Then the gymnast (played discreetly by Kurt Thomas) trains to participate in this match and find out what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br /> That sounds promising, does not it? Okay, so that's not the case, but still, this plot of sypnopsis does not begin to describe the joys of this film. They can be found in the strange details of the film. As the mysterious asian girlfriend of the gymnast, who does not speak during the first half-hour of the film, suddenly starts to talk and does not shut up the rest of the time! Or the nasty, really naked shirtless who likes to create and break the nonexistent rules of "The Game" whenever he wishes. And of course, there is the delightful adventure of our hero through the "Village of The Crazies" (obviously, this is the real name of the place!). Nice place to visit, but I would not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But what really shines in this movie are the action scenes. As our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it wise to place gymnastics equipment in the alleys and squares of Middle Eastern cities, so that our master Gymkata is better able to use his gymnastic talents to fight the scourge of evil in parallel. the bars and the ointment horses. You have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing to note. A lot, I would say about half of the cast, dies of being hit by an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only effects or credible actions of the whole film. If they were any effects, my only word of compliment to those who designed these very realistic injuries. More likely, it was the way the movie did not pay the extras. Nevertheless, "Gymkata" deserves a glance if you can see it without paying and look for a foolishness that would be an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
