One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds after the beginning of this film, I decided it was pretty bad. It was just after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) fell from a tree on his horse to join the group of good guys. I was quite mystified by all the gimmick Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 that did not translate at all. Obviously, the name of Coppola in the credits could do nothing to guarantee success here, even with more than one name. <br /> <br /> If you get to the end of the movie, you will probably end up having the same questions as me. What exactly was the hook with the gloves? What happens with the rodeo scenario? Who was the stranger supposed to represent? Why did they do this movie? <br /> <br /> I could probably continue but my energy has been exhausted. Look, there's already a western called "The Gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the main character. You will feel as good looking as if you feel bad. The one I can recommend.
