So ... so we have additional images of Brando ... interesting but not really worthy of an Oscar. Susannah York was barely outdone. The new scene where Lois discovers Clark is Superman is slightly incredible in the sense that he does not notice blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets. Real bullets would have entered his clothes, then dropped him on the floor, but forget that ... let's listen Donner make fun of Lester's version that made more sense. The president talks about the Zod "damaging" the original Washington monument, Mount Rushmore. Tweaking this scene made this line quite absurd. Superman's "Freedom of the Press" line seemed silly compared to "Care to go out" which was better delivered and had a proper connection to Clark's previous scene at the truck stop. Then there is the end with the effect "return the world to go back in time". It went all over the film and led you to wonder exactly where the rocket was aimed at Hackensack, N.J., since it no longer frees Zod and his company.
