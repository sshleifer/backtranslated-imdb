After watching Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozens of times and enjoying each second, I finally had the chance to see her sequel Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed because he did not live up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their heads are not my idea of ​​a good movie. Philip Glass's score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlative strength of the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this film seemed slow and useless. A diluted version of Baraka, which is the same idea but is better done. I sincerely hope that the third film in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
