WOW! Why would someone make a sequel to an already rancid movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie but at least had at least some idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what he wants to be. It simply exists on the screen for reasons that I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole film is as follows: Twitch (played by Kurupt Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where there could be a box filled with buried gold bricks. In the prison, a riot breaks out between rival prisoners, one of them is shot by a certain Cortez and Cortez plans his escape. On a spousal visit, Twitch's fiancée and Burke's daughter (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and held in an execution room. Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and they end up having trouble with the idiotic inmates while discovering that Cortez has their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most useless sequel since Universal Soldier: The Return. The scenario is terrible, the acting is horrible, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this film is a caricature. Listen, I know it was a low-budget film, but it's not an excuse for these guys not to try to do what they do. Nobody in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. No one in this film can be taken seriously as an actor, Kurupt should be ashamed of himself, his character "Twitch" is pretty much a pin-less minstrel puppet who spends most of his time Being caught by Jack or other inmates, Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking all the way through the film, as if he were forced to take a PHD (huge hump). choreographed and pathetic, and for an action movie, HPD2 is rather boring, even in case of action! Do not let anyone tell you that this movie is a little decent, it stinks and is one of the main reasons why people despise Follywood.
