You can say, "Don Johnson like Elvis, can it work, is it possible, it seems like a terrible choice, but maybe I should stay open, maybe I'd be surprised. he could succeed ... "<br /> <br /> NOT! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But it's a terrible Elvis. It is too small, too weak, too accentuated ... You have already imagined how bad it would be. Add to that a hokey black wig, an eyeliner and a thick mascara, and it's a big embarrassing bazaar. <br /> <br /> The best I can say is that since Johnson's play is decent and his imitation is so far away, after a while, you do not even think about him anymore like Elvis. You see him more like another crazy pop star. Then, at this level, the film becomes visible. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally chosen to embody Linda Thompson, the great queen of beauty. But she is attractive in herself and plays the role with the honesty, elegance and intelligence that we expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in his performance. You must be a kind of dope to stick to a dope who abuses dope. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in this story; we have heard it many times before. If you are looking for new information or new ideas, you will not find them. It's told as a love story - a story not shared: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
