Just looking at the trailer for Theodore Rex, you'd think it's a bad crime comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume. That's right, but it's mostly a futuristic story, much like Batman Forever's style of leadership and strange character designs. It was poorly targeted and should have been portrayed as a futuristic tale, not as a lame policeman comedy. Whether this movie is badly marketed or not, it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life with amazing technology. They talk and walk around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after the assassination of a dinosaur, he is in charge of the case, but he must be associated with Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg), the toughest cop. It's up to this incoherent duo to solve the murder and keep the audience awake long enough to get through this raw piece. <br /> <br /> Teddy begins the image as a normal theater character, but in the end, it is unbearable to listen. In addition to being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad imitator. He imitates famous characters and accents and has really terrible lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and he says, "It's not my trumpet!" Wow! What childish and immature line, even for a children's movie of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping Teddy would bite his head all the way through the movie. <br /> <br /> This film never knew what he wanted to be. When futuristic scenes and actions occur, there is no comedy or humor. In all non-action scenes, the characters try to be as funny as possible, resulting in constant boredom. The action scenes do not work because they are too strange and not violent enough and, as noted above, the comedy is only a band of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here. <br /> <br /> Having a duo of human dinosaurs / detectives seems to be a rather original film, if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a huge scam of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace the dinosaurs with cartoons and set it up in the future. It's exactly the same thing. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and a detective solve the murder, a detective and a detective solve the murder. The villains of Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and the weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act like weasels. The scene of Roger Rabbit's clubs, where Jessica Rabbit walks on the stage, is imitated by dinosaurs. It's a huge scam for a much better movie! <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a bad movie, which does not even deserve its VHS stature. <br /> <br /> My note: 1/2 on ****. 90 minutes PG for mild violence, language and raw humor.
