If you expect to see a lot of them in the Altıoklar bath, as the slogan promises, you will be very disappointed to see that the film consists only of Altıoklar's populist style on such famous subjects as sex, marriage and cheating. Too much nudity, which seems to come from nowhere and has no connection with the plot, proves that Altikar did not succeed in "trying something new" as he quoted. Too many sex-centric jokes seem to show that Alkiklar fell under the spell of the famous saying that "sex sells". I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. However, at the end, I found myself sitting for 90 minutes watching Altıoklar's experimental experiments, but still focused too much on the extension work.
