Watching Smother was perhaps the longest of my life, not quite 90 minutes. There was no laughter to have; In fact, I do not remember ever having smiled. Diane Keaton was horribly unfathomable as a guardian of dogs smoking a mature chain, the character of an indestructible mother, a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffered from a personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and most of all boring. <br /> <br /> I guess I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long series of cinematographic clich√©s - that far-off, far away and socially inept parent who is just trying to break into "The Industry", that gruff and suffering father who is still adorable, the gentle-mannered woman who can do not take it anymore (but ends up coming out of discord and returns home resigned), the flock of unharmed dogs who love to chew cushions when everyone is gone, etc. <br /> <br /> God, what a snoring. I have never been a fan of Diane Keaton and Smother reminded me why. Too much is too much, no matter how many photos you have made at your peak. His attempts at physical comedy were particularly humiliating. What did the director think? <br /> <br /> While I like Dax Shepard and I can even sometimes support Liv Tyler, their performances were so dull and dull that it was clear that no actor did not care about this movie. It did not matter, because I. Keaton also did not stop chatting, he was intolerable and, sometimes, Shepard's disgust for her seemed sincere. At the end of the movie, I wanted to slap her myself. <br /> <br /> Awful.
