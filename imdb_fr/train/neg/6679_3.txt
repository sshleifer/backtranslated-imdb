Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this film <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in 8 to 9 roles, his father, his mother, his grandfather, his sister and more later, he disguises himself <br /> <br /> In short, he is a useless detective sent by a friend on a case to obtain evidence against his wife, whose photos he loses at the airport flirting with Rani <br /> He disguises himself as Sardarji on the plane and again as a girl What is funny is how he does this easily and quickly. <br /> <br /> Then he disguises himself as a French singer and enters a television to get evidence lol, then as a Maharashtrian (yes inside the television itself) <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has the same wrong identities and ends on a predictable note. There are funny scenes like that of Govinda struck by an African and many other portions <br /> <br /> The staging of Manoj Agrawal goes well The music goes well <br /> <br /> actors, Govinda proves that he is one of the most outstanding actors in the world. He is as usual fan Tastic, he has already played such roles before ending up in all the games and roles although the 6 and 7 long-awaited roles do not really fit into the film. Rani looks big, makes good team with Govinda It's her Nothing good and continue to play such types of roles Among the rest, Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever is too strong sometimes and funny in places in one role and irritates like the older Tinnu Anand is fine Satish Kaushik is hilarious, Paresh is fine Tanaaz is fine
