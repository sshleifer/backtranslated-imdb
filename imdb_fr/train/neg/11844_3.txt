Anyone who loves 1920s jazz, the 1920's dress, Charleston and ultra-chic yachts (for example, me, in all respects) will love this movie. But the sad fact is that's all there is. The intrigue is banal and obvious, most often acting is horrible, or the side of the farce, and when all is over, there is not much left except the impression of mirrors and smoke. It's a bad movie beautifully done.
