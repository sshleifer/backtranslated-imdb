I can not believe this film was made in 1984. It has laughable roles, not to mention one of the most stupid plots of all time. Who would ever have asked the big Texas sheriff, Joe Don Baker, to escort an Italian he had illegally arrested in Mexico to return to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the film tells you almost nothing - in fact, it is a title as generic as that which I can think for an action / police film. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to see this only on MST3K with Mike and robots as a shield. They notice the likeness of the main woman with Elaine de Seinfeld ("None of them are spongeworthy") and do not just stop on Baker's weight. This film is probably no worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's reputation definitely precedes him here: when his title appears at the beginning of the movie, Tom says, "I would like to be illiterate not to have to read that."
