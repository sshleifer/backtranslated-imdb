In the field of science fiction, two particular themes have constantly attracted interest. They were initially explored in the literature of a pre-kinematic era. They have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers, with varying degrees of success. The first theme, that of time travel, has always fascinated film fans, as has the writing recently on screen with another version of H.G. Wells' classic "The Time Machine". The second theme, which also captivates the public, is that of invisibility, which arouses the imagination with its apparently infinite and innumerable possibilities. And this theme is also again the basis of a film adapted from another classic HG Wells, "The Invisible Man", whose realization is here "Hollow Man", directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have been experimenting with the US government for some time, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have finally achieved in a number of ways. primates on which they tested their method. In fact, they have progressed to the point that invisibility is assured; Their only problem now is to bring the subject back to its original "visual" state. It's a problem, though, that Caine, after a diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved - or at least, he thinks. And when the application of his theory on a living subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in order to maintain the necessary funding for the continuation of the project. <br /> <br /> However, at the last minute, Caine is wary, fearing control of the project will be removed before they can move to the next level: testing a human subject. And he takes the initiative to become this subject, securing the help of his research team by telling them that the board of directors has given them permission. But something is wrong, and Caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility; and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it's too late, everything begins to wreak havoc in Caine's mind. And suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes irrelevant, as he faces the imminent danger of losing much more than that. Now, there is a good chance he will lose everything - including himself. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven realized what was initially an exciting, even provocative film; he sets a good pace and uses the F / X at his disposal with great effect, although he tends to let the striking visuals overwhelm the development of the character. Anyone familiar with "The Invisible Man", or in fact anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know very early that Caine is not destined for happier times. Still, Verhoeven has a narrative style that will certainly capture the attention and engage his audience. But he seems determined to rush to the climax and abandons along the way all the nuance that makes the success of his film so far, preferring to enter a final sequence that is nothing more than a thoroughbred -cold. festival that betrays his audience and everything he worked for earlier in the film. Rather than seek an intelligent solution to Caine's suffering and be creative and imaginative in leading the film to its inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the lowest path, and even though he can succeed at a purely visceral, any sense that could be drawn from the story dissolves like ashes in the wind, with all that could have made this film a memorable film. And that's a shame, because Verhoeven has a higher level than what this genre offers, and he lets it sink unnecessarily to a much lower level. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a credible character, if only superficial, that seems to perfectly serve Verhoeven's purposes. Bacon's description is not thorough, but it has more to do with his director's program than his own acting abilities. Verhoeven just does not give Bacon the time to develop Caine to a lesser extent; the character is primarily a ship around which Verhoeven can build his story, and to that end, it works. The film would have been better served, however, if Verhoeven and Bacon had collaborated more closely at least to create a link between Caine and the audience, which would have caused emotional involvement on the part of viewers, which would have brought them a little more early, rather than leaving them at the door, as mere observers of an extravagance charged with F / X. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Shue delights in the role of Linda McKay, consenting accomplice of Caine in the bad experience, but it's basically a thankless part that offers few challenges, especially to an actor of the caliber of Shue. The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so beautiful in the 2001 film, `Things Behind the Sun '). His character, Sarah Kennedy, only supports action and f / x. Both actors are capable of much more and deserve better than what they are given to work here. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer). Fun to a point, and even successful at a certain level (low), "Hollow Man" is one of those movies that lets you contemplate what could have been. Like an annual firework, it will give you momentary thrills, but after a while, it will begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, with nothing special to differentiate it. And it's a shame, because given the talent and abilities of the people involved here, it could have been a lot more. I note this one 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
