It's one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the acting is really embarrassing. Was not Archer once a decent actress? What happened to him? The action is decent but completely implausible. The makeup is so bad that it is worth mentioning. I mean, those who think of makeup in a contemporary feature film. Someone should tell the makeup artist and the DOP that you're not supposed to see her. The end is a huge disappointment - in the lineage of "and then they realized it was a dream" <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money. You better look in space for 2 hours.
