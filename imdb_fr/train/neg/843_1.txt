A BDSM "subculture" in Los Angeles serves as a backdrop to this low-budget, mediocre mess, a masterpiece of famous actress Celia Xavier, who produces and writes scripts while acting as sisters binoculars. Vanessa and Celia. A quick question arises as to whether a rather immoderate camera, lights, and pyrotechnics may ever reach a connection point with a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensitive viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for Los Angeles County, while her devilish twin has become an iconic figure in her fetishistic world, primarily because of her erotic performances on CD-ROM, but when the disaster occurs, "Mistress Vanessa", virtuous CÃ©lia, determined to unearth her sister's evil assailant, begins a new job as a "sex slave" at the Castle Club, where the specialty of the house is a "party dungeon ". Two FBI agents in the field (whose deployment in the Vanessa case is apparently necessary because of his involvement in BDSM websites), as well as a homicide detective from the Los Angeles Police Department, are responsible for to investigate the crime, while ensuring the safety of Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new calling is eagerly regarded by her clients for creating personal danger conditions for her. Deficiencies in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide attributed to L.A.P.D.'s Office of Operations-South, a region of the metropolis far removed from the film frame. Management is not targeted and is not supported by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction. The aforementioned photographic gymnastics ends with a casual montage near the end of the previous film, which refers indirectly to the screenplay. Among these clinkers, a solid action tour appears: Stan Abe as a zealous agent of the FBI.
