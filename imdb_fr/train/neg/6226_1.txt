I gritted my teeth throughout this movie. First, the silly intrigue has nothing to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has been trying to create some kind of comic car chase movie. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Do not take anything in this film to be precise. The name Parsons in the title and theft of his body are only used as a springboard for a low-budget chase movie, a blatant attempt to recover a few dollars from the legacy of Parsons and his fans. Gram's father had been dead since 1973, the other world characters are fiction, none of this has to do with the life or death of Grams. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Gram, I advise you not to see this movie. I wish I did not do it. It is heartbreaking to see something special treated like unsightly fodder. I swear I heard Gram spin in his grave while reading the movie. If you're not familiar with Gram's life and legacy, do not take anything in this movie as Gram. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about this film. If Gram was alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. Once again, he might be scared if he knew that this film would result.
