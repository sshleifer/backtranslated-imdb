Just watched, my better half and I could not believe how terrible and bad it was. If someone else thinks it's good, then you must be easily satisfied. I actually gave an evening to watch that, everything was done before. THAT IS TO SAY. the hostel comes to mind, but at least it did not make you cringe for the bad acting and the lack of stories, even old stuff, re-hatched, I read so much about of this movie, I had even recommended it to my friends, my fault, someone said it was good! no more gore, horror or back out of disgust than your average "horror film", it must be said, please do not bother with this movie. get Mary Poppins. now it's scary! I go to the cinema and look at something scary, little ray of sunshine maybe
