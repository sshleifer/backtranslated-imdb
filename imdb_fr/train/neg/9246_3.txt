I refused to watch this show when it was originally aired, keeping the memory of the late 1960's series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have been better informed. Not quite a remake, and more of a parody than a tribute, this show was not sure how to play it, and was full of plots and characters of infant comedy and cartoons. The three main characters were only caricatures of actors and only Emilia Fox could play (Bob Mortimer is painful in a hetero role). Supporting actors were just comical knowledge of Vic and Bob wanting to be part of the joke, and all too aware of the situation to be convincing. And the CGI, although the effects can not help to improve those available 30 years earlier, simply dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work, and hardly obscured the poor quality of scripts and dialogue. All style and without substance. (And while the 1960s show masquerades as much of its time, this "update" is now also very dated, with "Matrix" style modes, mandatory scenes of "female power" tracks.)
