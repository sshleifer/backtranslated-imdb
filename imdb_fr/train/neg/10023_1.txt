Shame on the movies Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra, who seems to have lost his wits over the years and providing constant prices in guts in this piece of shitty film that is not even worth the You Tube standards. I gritted my teeth throughout the film, from beginning to end, with the schizophrenic staging, a plot that had never quite materialized and on the last stage, I was just ashamed that my country and his crorepati cinephiles can "FAR OUT" crores on such stupidity. Shame on the actors for taking this job and even commenting on it as a job they can accept. Saif Ali Khan - Completely disappointed with your choice of movie. Kareen shows enough skin for affected puberty and Akshay appears as a weak mind. Another delay with a pubescent fascination for the English. Her friends were worthy of being hired in their game and with the weird cinematography scattered over the last 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel. Do not waste any cerebral cells, energy or your money to go see this - Go see / rent AMU - with Konkana Sensharma instead - a beautiful independent film released Indian.Intelligent, poignant and a beautiful tale that will affect everyone with actors intelligent and gave me hope that not everything is lost in the making of Indian cinema.
