Well, you'd better get through this amateurish, bland and pokey movie about a middle-aged widowed mother who has a little more in common with her young adult or teenager than she would like. Settled in Tunis, Mom tinkers around the apartment, gets angry and decides, although reluctantly (she can not help it), to put on the costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, his daughter is taking dance classes. The common denominator is a Tunisian group drummer. This movie is so full of content that I watched the DVD in x2 format and read the subtitles, quickly passing through much of the very ordinary dance and loooong shots of walking (they walk everywhere) and more walking and wading in x4 format simply This boring, storyless and low-budget film has allowed some to get very good critical applause. Go understand. (C-)
