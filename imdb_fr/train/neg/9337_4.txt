Far from providing the coffee you expect from a film named after the most energizing hot drinks, Coffy cracks and never goes beyond the stage of revenge. Indeed, if the film was a cup of coffee, it would be rather weak and watery, littered with some unwanted residues and lacking a persistent aftertaste. Sporadically, it falls, but otherwise it's not the drama of action he hopes to be. <br /> <br /> In summary, Coffy is a nurse who does justice herself and does tough justice. to the lady-pimpin ', drug-sucking who hung her younger sister in a depraved and sick state. Socio-political commentary on the plight of urban black youth in America occupies a prominent place in Coffy, which provokes thought as Coffy's crusades and the political corruption and racism of whites, who profit and serve as a parasite to targeted Afro-Americans. . American minorities. Unfortunately, timely messages are compromised by the poor quality and lack of focus of the film. Coffy's ideas are important, they are simply poorly targeted. <br /> <br /> One of the benefits of Coffy is the presence of Pam Grier, Blaxploitation icon. Grier plays her role brilliantly and creates an attractive heroine by firing shots in her often spectacular self-defense acts of violence (how to run a house stuffed with hoods - drive the car through the front door!). It is just too bad that the scenario wobbles from time to time, wasting time to reduce sexual exploitation as much as possible. The small budget can not help, but the fact that Coffy lacks a groove for a movie Blaxploitation. Just as problems are undermined by lack of quality, so entertainment and enthusiasm are masked by moments of boredom and bad direction. <br /> <br /> The end result is irreproachable. We have a trendy heroine but not a fashionable movie. It's a shame because Coffy has its moments and should rightly be considered as a key film of the craze for Blaxploitation; it simply never exceeds the average lukewarm.
