Hey HULU.com plays the Elvira horror show late at night on their site and this movie is their Monsteroid name, it's a pleasure to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie ... Have fun with the bad movies. Anyway, this movie really has little value except to see how bad the horror movies were for Bad Effects horror movies, Bad Dialog, just for the bad quality of movie. Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. While you're at HULU, take a look at the other available movies. There are 10 episodes. Some movies are quite decent, with good plot and good production. You can watch a lot in 480p as long as you have a fast connection.
