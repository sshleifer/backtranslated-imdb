Hey, look, do it, there are much better representations of Black America's difficulties than this one. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is about the poor execution of the story, which I mentioned, with blows. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid 80's and it's horrible in the music / score department. It's funny to see Oprah as a type of crack whore of the last days. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger locks Elizabeth McGovern into the incinerator. Pure classical cinema. First of all, I do not care about your intoxication, you will react to a flame of 1200 Â° F (no matter how serious your game). But they really tracked down this scene ... it was comical. I'll tell you what, it was a great satisfaction to see Elizabeth McGovern burn in a false death; she annoys me.
