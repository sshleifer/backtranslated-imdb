I am a fan of Batman cinema and television. I liked the show (new and old) and I liked all the movies. But this movie is not as great as some people hoped. In my opinion, this is a big disappointment. I think the problem was that there was no drama. Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker had a lot of drama. and Batman & M. Freeze: Sub Zero also experienced a drama. Also, I think this movie is in the light for Batman. The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane in the end. Anyway, it's a good Batman movie. But I would just like to praise him.
