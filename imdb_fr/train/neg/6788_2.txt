The idea of ​​In the name of the people is good, a murderer does not want his only daughter to be in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. And you can expect the actors, especially Scott Bakula, to do good things, but unfortunately not! In the name of the people turns out to be the usual teary on Friday night. The flashbacks with the girl who was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can predict what the actors are going to say ... If you want to watch a good movie on this subject, watch Dean Man Walking!
