End of the World is a film without history, strange since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth. The main character is a kind of scientist, I do not know exactly what kind. He occupies two jobs in a government establishment (?) Supervised by four security guards. His first job is to monitor transmissions to and from space (although this actually looks like a hobby he does when he is not working at Work # 2). Task # 2 forces her to put on a protective suit and go to a dark room ... at least that's the best I can imagine. Apparently, the "plant" is not exactly top secret because the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs out (they are about to dine) as he discovers a message from space: a major disturbance of the Earth, repeated over and over again. He says it's the first space message he's ever been able to decipher. his wife tells him that they will be late for dinner. So they leave and go to the party (!?!). Moments later, he discovers that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there, the film goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is involved, but it does not help much. Moreover, Lee gives a dull performance in the direction of his appearance in Howling II. This film is boring, but it contains enough stupid elements to make it happen once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-level science fiction. In addition, there are many archive footage of the Earth being destroyed.
