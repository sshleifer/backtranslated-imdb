After watching this movie, you will understand why it has not even been shown in theaters! This film does not deserve the tag "prequel". Rather, it's a recurring theme in Hollywood: tearing good movies with disastrous preambles, sequels, and so on. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie was bouncing around like a ping-pong ball. nonexistent. I seriously felt like watching a comedy at certain times of the movie because the acting was really bad. P Diddy must stop tarnishing the movies with his horrible game, he made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in this movie and had fun watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Carlito's Way, I recommend you do not watch this. If you still decide to watch it, treat it as if it was tearing the original, because that's exactly what it did.
