I saw this film in its entirety in the 60s and 70s. Yes, it is horrible and could well be the spawner of the series "Faces of Death" popular in the 80s and 90s. Given the state of the so-called "driver training" nowadays, this one should be viewed by all those who are preparing to learn to drive. When you see violent death in all its horror, you certainly have (if you have the slightest sensitivity) a more accurate perspective of the responsibilities required to drive safely, a moment of inattention or inattention to flying can do. I worked for Bell Telephone in the '70s and' 80s, and at one point he was assigned to a security class. I found this film in the library of the company, I showed it during the session, a number of people fell physically ill and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said, "I never knew that a car accident could be so terrible! This film, and another, "RED ASPHALT", is certainly the reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget it, I only wish I could find a copy when my children attended "driver's ed" in high school!
