So there's an old security guard and a guy who dies, and then there's KEVIN, the biggest lunatic in the world. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty and virginal girlfriend, AMY. As he returns from work in ... a random house ... he finds his "friends", the sexually disconcerting KYLE and the really revolting Sluttish Daphne. They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, NICK, the macho lunkhead to the delirious sexual madness of the trigger. And there are the creatures of the title, horrible little dog puppets that kill people by giving them the envy of their hearts. Kyle's desire is to mate with a disgusting and disgusting woman in spandex. Nick's desire is to throw grenades in a cafeteria - I mean a nightclub. Kevin's desire is to beat a skinny thug with nunchucks. Amy's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne is already a disgusting slut, she does not want to heart. On the way, a really hideous group is singing a really strange song. The hobgoblins go back to where they came from and then explode. "Citizen Kane" can not hold the candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema.
