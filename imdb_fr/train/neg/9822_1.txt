There were moments in the film where I would have liked to be beaten to death. The only reason I endured the whole movie was because I could not believe how bad it was and I thought it had to get better. It was really a horror movie. I was horrified to lose what seemed to be 4 hours of my life that I will never come back. The other two hours, I mourned the loss. Please, recommend this movie to those you want to torture and tell them that the suspense will kill them.
