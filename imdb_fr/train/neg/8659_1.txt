There are things that I will never understand. Like this movie. What if I had to create a dino and polygon crocodile model in Maya that was really cheap and disgusting, then copy and paste into an amateur video clip in which people scream and eat the same thing? How can one even believe that a completely wrong CGI dinocroc that seems completely out of place would have an influence on the events of this movie? I know that his category B, his small budget and all the producers, except the producers, could do better than make a shit that no one will ever see or see. It does not mean anything. Are people really so stupid that they would sit in there? Apparently yes. For fun? No, this thing is not even worth laughing.
