This film is not worth the next few minutes I will criticize, but I know that many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to help choose a movie. For this reason alone, I write this. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of the 1976 "The Incredible Torture Show" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... of course, everything is there with a third-year scenario, a pathetic acting game and the perverse failure of a black comedy attempt. <br /> The movie takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the movie who are horrified by the slaughter of dogs on a market, but who are sexually excited to enter a porn room. A girl disgusted with dirt in a quiet room a few moments later is still arguing with her boyfriend friend (the way he came in might be the only thing fascinating about this movie.) The movie is absolutely horrible, even for a serial movie. Even if you had to download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
