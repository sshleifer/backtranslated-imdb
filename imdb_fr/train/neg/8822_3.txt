Depending entirely on your personal state of mind when you look at it, "Christmas Evil" can become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and exasperating holiday-themed slashers ever created. Personally, I'm tempted to choose the latter because I did not bother doing a search and I was just expecting a slasher of the early 80s, a bit cheesy and undemanding, with a bag to back in Santa Claus costume slaughtering people. False! The film is actually about a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a toy factory and considers it his responsibility to determine, on Christmas Eve, who deserves gifts and deserves punishment. Harry's problems all started when he witnessed Santa Claus ?? his dad in costume obviously ?? stroking her mother's bare legs at a young age. After that, he became an outcast of society, much to the annoyance of his younger brother, who is about to crack one day (holi). I totally understand why some fans enjoy this slightly eccentric horror movie, but should it be so boring? There are several parts of the film, apparently long and endless, in which absolutely nothing is happening. I can forgive the brevity of bloody and outrageous bloodshed, but this film does not even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or unexpected twists. (With the exception of the final blow, I must admit). In addition, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazy protagonist concentrated to fatally punish naughty children! It does not kill and kill only adults who behave badly. How are you supposed to take the controversial and original Christmas thriller seriously while Santa does not even commit a miserable childish murder? That would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic, while it is nothing more than a forgotten and pitiful mess.
