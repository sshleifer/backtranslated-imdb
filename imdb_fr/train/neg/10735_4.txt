Maybe I was an old Muscovite myself and had a sense of elastic humor that prevented me from throwing this film in the trash 'arthouse / festival crap'. This is not the biggest film of 2005, nor a complete waste. It just has a lot of problems. I also sincerely doubt that this film was banned because of "ideological fears", "conservative taboos" or any other reason, this film could instead be described as "brave" and "without compromise" abroad. It was banned because censors knew that 99% of Russian film lovers would find it shocking because of the bad taste exerted during the filming and editing of this otherwise dull film. <br /> <br /> We have a solid opening. stroke. Beautiful sound design, excellent place - loaded with meaning and symbolism. The use and arrangement of the symbols will always be the strongest aspects of the film (the number 4 is not a major visual challenge). Over the next 40 minutes, we have an equally strong configuration. A fun and well-written conversation at the bar between the 3 characters (main?), And we feel pathetic for these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and all the rest. Then the movie starts to slow down. We begin to wonder what future holds. <br /> <br /> The rest is pretty boring, quite simply. Of course, the village guy pulls the rope to the heart and there are some fun moments. Beautiful sound, of course. But the pleasure of this film, not to mention the plot, is seriously compromised by the problems of rhythm. And this, this lack of reward for sitting down in all the abject misery and sadness (well done), is what will end up getting people upset about the pathetic "offensive" stuff, harmless drunkards can appear). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a nice film in which the Russians are lost for long periods (the whole film), look at Particulars of the National Hunt. Much more gratifying of post-Soviet things. So yes, a 4 out of 10 for 4, nice and symbolic of my post-mediocre state.
