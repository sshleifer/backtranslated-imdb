A trio of criminals sentenced to death, led by Matt Dillon, commits a robbery late at night. They flee but quickly cross the police who is in pursuit of a terrorist. Of course, the police confuse the gang of burglars with the terrorist, the real terrorist escaping, and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dip of a bar, taking hostages, without knowing why the police are so determined to catch them. And guess who else chose the bar as a sanctuary for the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And it comes down the hill. Spacey has acquired a good acting talent. Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and Emmett Walsh, but they are all wasted. Mainly because after all the characters are stuck in the bar, everything they do for the rest of the movie is discussed. Endless and aimless. Well before the end of the movie, you do not care anymore about their fate.
