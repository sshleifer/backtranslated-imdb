Not as bad as some claim, although obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as a naughty Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original, as they obviously did not have the same effect. Apart from a few mediocre action scenes, the rest of the film is flawed. The development of the character was mediocre and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes and missing information that I would not have known if I had not read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the film was the supporting roles of Nisha Kothari and in particular this new guy called Prashant Raj. Nisha is simply annoying from the moment her lips open for the first time. As for Prashant Raj - seriously, who is this guy? where did he come from and why was he present in the movie studio for something other than serving drinks? Her actress ability is nil and he has the same tone, the same communication and the same expression in every scene, be it action, comedy or even a scene where someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions have changed, which is more than I can say for his companion error. All in all, RGV's Aag deserves to be watched for Amitabh's strong performance, as well as a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
