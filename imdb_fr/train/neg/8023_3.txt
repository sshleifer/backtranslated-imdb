After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. The voiceover describes the film as surreal. Well, there is surrealism and surrealism. <br /> <br /> There was actually only one part of the film that seemed surreal, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual images, including the dining room scene where everyone is on the floor, were so absurd that they had no meaning. Pictures that do not mean anything do not bother me, but these scenes just seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I do not know what else could explain what was happening. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me the slightest idea of ​​what Logan thought from his point of view or even his emotional state. All I could say was that he was not particularly satisfied with his physical appearance and that he had a crush on an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought that the end indicated what the relationship between boys had become, but not much else. Deliberately juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were simpler seemed to me more like a cop than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> However, the film was for me as tedious and without content as it was a radical change of pace. I loved Madagascar Skin and I felt that this film aspired to this kind of story and maybe even style. It did not even close. For me, there is no doubt: this film deserves an A for the effort, but a D for the execution.
