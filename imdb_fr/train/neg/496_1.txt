Imagine that you are a high school student, deep in a dark theater and disused with your girlfriend. How bad should a film be so that you feel obliged to leave the theater and return home before the end? This movie is so bad. Really. Movies often become so bad that they are good; this film is beyond this stage of malice. It's painfully bad. Horribly, terribly, crime against humanity bad.
