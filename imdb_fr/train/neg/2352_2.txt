Gross, sometimes rude - for me, it is the synthesis of the last work of Madhur Bhandarkar - page 3. It has no point of view - is content to dig a superficial and amusing stereotypes. What is the film about?? Is it about pointing out a clan of people (of the so called type) who are so busy socializing and advancing their profile in life - that they do not have time to do anything else. And you are either inside or outside. Is there no press to report incidents every day? Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and is only a complement; maybe an artist to check who is who and what. Do not mix the two. And then there is the power game - it would happen in every area of ​​life. So what did you say at the end of everything - nothing - just some crude jokes related in a less directional movie.
