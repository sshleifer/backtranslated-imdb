An average movie quality, a formula totally inspired by a religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who explains: "I'm not just the president of 'Psychos R Us, I'm also a client.') Who takes control of a biochemical virus (think the virus from the movie "The Rock"). Too bad for him being stuck in a bank during an earthquake with robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by Wolf Larson, physically impressive and slightly entertaining, supported by Fred Dryer) with the standard "in the wrong place at the wrong time" a filaude woman (always sweet Erika Eleniak) and "lived like a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute" a man (Brandon Karrer). Contains the usual story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic (wife and son killed during a police raid a few years ago). <br /> <br /> Basically, a decent rainy movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite line, said by Ron Perlman after finding the vial of the virus hidden in the cleavage of Erika Eleniak: "A woman and her mystery." <br /> <br /> Worth the rent .
