This "movie" is one of the most terrible things I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent drink. <br /> <br /> Shake the camera and invite your actors to adopt scraps does not count as "direction", what this film needed en masse. Not that the writing was wonderful, but we still had a lot of completely artificial characters directed in the most artificial way (the "style" pseudo-documentary prized by those who do not know how to direct). <Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it has been made with cynicism to seduce critics who do not know the profession of director (most of them). <br /> <br /> It's terrible. That says a lot about Sundance and what has become of Victor Vargas now.
