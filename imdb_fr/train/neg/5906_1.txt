This movie was terrible. The plot was nil, the acting was bad, the editing was inept and this film makes me want to screw my eyes. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie. The balloon scene was stupid, Mormon jokes are very old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two main actors, it's full of stereotypes, stupid "celeb" local cams ... the most Notorious was Del "I'm going to drive as fast as I want .." silly computer. The worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even ruined everything. This film helps create a long line of dull efforts to incorporate the LDS beliefs in Hollywood. THAT IS TO SAY. The RM, the church ball, etc., etc. I would give up watching this movie and I would rather run into a brick wall. You'll be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show.
