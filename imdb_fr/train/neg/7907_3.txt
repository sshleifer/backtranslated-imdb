An excellent performance of Alix Elias highlights a pile of dreck otherwise misdirected and confused. I have seen this film a dozen times and, with each passage, I find less and less pleasure. Why are the Munchies so lustful? Has this already been explained? Are they a reflection of our 'stupid and coarse animal itself?' If so, why not make it more obvious? Why not go back just a little of the subtlety that infests this movie and make that connection explicit? Another part of this film that bothers me endlessly - the motorcycles. The jacket that the little monster wears on the blanket seems to suggest a "wise traveler". The sunglasses say "pretty cool guy". With all this, I'm ready for Easy Rider to meet the Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). Which give? If you're a fan of tiny reptile puppets, if you're a fan of crack, you'll get the treatment you deserve.
