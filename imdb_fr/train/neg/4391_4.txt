A young scientist, Harry Harrison, brilliantly pursues his deceased father's scientific research on regeneration of limbs, but his mother and doctor-lover increasingly want to sell the serum. When he finds out that there is an accident, Harry loses an arm. So, he tries the serum and what results is a genetically disturbed arm that has its own spirit. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen it oh so many times before, but that's what makes it so good The performance of the movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed is quite bumpy. In fact, it's not a bad film of Fangoria; there are just better ones, which are similar in the vein. "Servered Ties" simply does not have its own distinctive style. The weird nature and unpleasant splashing sounded like "Re-animator" and even a touch of burlesque sounded like "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> The comic story is really dazzling with its dark humor, but it can get melodramatic and a bit dry in the fun factor. Surprises arise, especially the final result of the film. Which is well accepted because I thought it could have been replaced by something more accessible. For low-budget production, FX makeup may sound stiff and clumsy, but there are grotesque moments that will make you smile rather than frighten you. Even a hint of sexual tension simplifies the story, thanks to the severely juicy performance of Elke Sommer as a mother. Oliver Reed is completely humorous, and he's doing extremely well. They were both extremely entertaining because the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delicious in an erratic performance like Harry. The director Damon Santostefano strides energetically through the film and orchestrates striking and striking horror scenes. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's juvenile and basically stupid, but you have to give it to him for a little bit of fun.
