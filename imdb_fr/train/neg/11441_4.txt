After a promising first 25-minute game that keeps you warm, you're sure it will be a great romantic comedy. Then the film takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> The feeling of warmth may still be there, but as others have already said: the plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> The film accelerates and you have the impression that you are moving quickly or that the producers decide to organize it in less than 1h40 and have to cut a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an objective in itself, but as a spectator, I am quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, it is simply the case. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this film has some beautiful interiors and despite the bad scenario, I think the performances of the actors are mainly good. If I could only evaluate the first 25 minutes, I would probably give him an eight. As things stand, we get a four. ... and that's nice! <br /> <br /> If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably have a good time. Otherwise, I recommend you look something else.
