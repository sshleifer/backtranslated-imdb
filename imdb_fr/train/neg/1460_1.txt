If another Hitler presents itself, it will be partly thanks to nonsense like this film, which propagates the absurd notion that he was a madman visibly disturbed from the beginning. Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land, sensible people would cross the street to avoid it, and he would have died in a nameless and unknown ditch. To read the stories of Hitler's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for example - will be struck by the fact that people have found him kind, intelligent and generous. He was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem exaggerated and that the speeches of modern listeners ignore the time when they were uttered, at which time pompous appetite was common in political speeches. Ditto for the exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was neither a central element of the first Nazis - who were mainly anti-communist - nor unusual or unusual for the time. The film suggests that Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person who will kill tens of millions of people, you can ignore the ravers with soft lips. life the one described here. Instead, look for a charming and charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work benefits the country in a visible and material way. I fear that his personality is much more like that of Barack Obama than that of Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I was hoping a lot here and I had nothing but caricature. The fools who made this thing committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of 'Reefer Madness'.
