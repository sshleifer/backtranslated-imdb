A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50s and that he now has the power to ... ignite! <br /> <br /> I was really ready for this movie, with the director of the great Toby Hooper and the uncontrollable character Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not exceed the average level of the film on individuals with violent powers. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it. Unfortunately, she never seems to live up to her potential and extends her plot too much. However, the special effects are not bad and help lead the film to the final. <br /> <br /> The distribution is not bad, Dourif steals the show. <br /> <br /> All around, no classic but it's not the worst of the kind either. <br /> <br /> ** on ****
