One of the previous critics wrote that there seemed to be no common ground for Love Story's opinions; we loved him or hated him. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions on a scale of 1 to 10. For me, this film got a score of 4. There are some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland plays a fabulous role as a Oliver's father. But the film did not do a particularly convincing job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique that it deserved multiple viewing, at least not for me. I may be a bit snobbish, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I still have not seen Barry Lyndon - because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. The only exception is What's Up, Doc ?, in which his performance in straight is the perfect underlining for the protagonist of Barbra Streisand's gaffes - and, not by chance, he tries Love Story! McGraw and O'Neal tend to play their roles rather than play them. <br /> <br /> This film is remarkable for the beginning of a great career: it's the first film by Tommy Lee Jones.
