I admit that the majority of this film was not inspired, but I was always entertained. There is a wonderful sense of frenetic energy, above-average music, and the women in the film are fiercely defending themselves, there is no prowess here. I can think of dozens of other movies that were far worse. At least this one had an intriguing plot with social commentary. They talk about how the army deals with virus epidemics, destroys everything in sight, even if it means more, how martial law can be dangerous because democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to be trying to combine his earlier works (zombie, beyond, gates of hell) with the aim of improving them in one way or another. He had failed, but certainly not miserably, as one would like. number of people.I have a weakness for zombie movies, so I admit that I am somewhat partisan when it comes to seeing them again. All I'm saying is that this movie is good for once, if there has not been so much descension in the making of this film (stopped and bruno fulci (I can hack with the best of them), mattei took it back) it could have been much better and more focused. It will stay in my collection as a zombie fulci song. A surprising note is that there is a scene in zombie 3 that this man from the cemetery has actually scammed, I could not believe it myself, check it out, you will be surprised.
