When I go to the video store to rent a movie, I usually trust IMDb's views on a movie and, until this one, I've never seen a movie rated at 7.0 or higher on the movie. site that I did not appreciate. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, legendary director of some of the best movies of the twentieth century, made a mistake by making one of the biggest mistakes a director can make: filling the cast of a movie with characters absolutely inimitable and without any quality that redeems them. <Br /> <br /> I like movies with imperfect characters, but whatever the personality of someone dark, we all have a little light, we are all in shades of gray, some more darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet has crossed this line by filling the film with totally black and totally unfriendly and almost masochistic characters. <br /> <br /> Hank Ethan Hawke is a man-child of 30 years whining, immature and irresponsible, divorced from a marriage a woman who hates him and a girl who thinks he is losing, what he is really. His indecision and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he is too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to the collapse of their bank robbery plan and the murder of his mother. The moment he gets up with his older brother at the end of the film, it's more pathetic than stimulating. Ethan Hawke embodies his character well, but he does not have much to work with, because he is described as a person wearing a perpetually stamped boot on his face and he is not particularly interested in being there. . <br /> <br /> Speaking of the woman's character is just as bad. Almost every shot of the film in which she finds herself is her verbal reprimand for rent and money from child support, and her reputation for self-esteem already non-existent with insults. Seriously, that's about all the character does. His harpy behavior resembles a malicious attitude. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays their father, Charles. Although he has been a great actor for several decades, he passes about 90% of this film with the same mouth. a half-grimace open on his face as if he was suffering from the greatest constipation crisis in the world. For someone who has been an actor as long as Mr. Finney, you think he would be better able to vote. Even if he does not show it very much, his character is supposed to be afflicted with grief and filled with anger. And when he stifles Andy at the conclusion of the film, it's as if Dr. Frankenstein had put the monster he helped to create because of his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei does not have much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for an unfathomable reason. When Andy's world begins to get out of control, she jumps logically on the boat, but that does not make her any less selfish or selfish than any other character in the movie, but probably the one with the most common sense. And we finally get to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason why I rated this film as a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the financial leader diverting the heroine who diverts "perfect crime" to steal the insured jewelry from his parents turns out bad is hypnotic. His calm master planner's descent from an imperfect project to an unstable and deranged murderous maniac is credible and tragic. Hoffman's character ends up being the movie's main villain, but it's hard to blame himself because the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who has self-admitted poor parents. early led to the eventual psychosis of his son and the indirect and involuntary murder of his mother. . <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is only worth watching for the great performance of PSH and its family train wreck. Do not expect that there are characters worthy of encouragement because they really are not.
