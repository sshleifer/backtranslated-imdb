This Germany from 1919 to 1933 hardly resembles a Czech capital post-World War II. Oh, sorry, it's the Czech capital and we are in 2003, it's really funny. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most terrible history movies of the past. Röhm is taller than Adolf and looks so good, Göring is 40 when he is 23 and the "Führer" still looks 56. In Germany, in 1919, many houses were almost new (the First World War did not reach the German cities!). No plaster in ruins! Then the Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons around this building, ever. And this may seem like a miracle: in 1933, the firefighters of Greater Berlin have many motor vehicles, some even with turntable ladders, but none with hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: what kind of castle PLAYMOBIL was in the final sequence? For me, it was a kind of "Adventures of Adolf in Wonderland"
