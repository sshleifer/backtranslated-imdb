You know the story..Lovely children alone in the woods, when BAM! Something begins to cut them. <br /> <br /> Well this shit is no different.A group of children comes into a hut where the man is the twin brother has disappeared for years before. Suddenly, a star "UNKOWN CREATURE" cuts them out, and their only help is a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> To say that this film was bad is a euphemism, it's fucking! The acting was horrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looked very nerdy. And as all movies do nowadays, they try to make you lose some of their time, but they do not! <br /> <br /> This film has a positive point: the star LOST Maggie Grace.
