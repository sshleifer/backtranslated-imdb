I've seen a lot of original Sci-Fi Channel movies since I started watching them in 2002 (my first movie was Sabretooth - which is one of Sci-Fi Channel's funniest features in my opinion) . Their quality varies. Some of them are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Werewolf never cried, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously bad, and some are really terrible. Raptor Planet resides in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to Sci-Fi's original 2004 channel, Raptor Island, is a clutter of a barely watchable film with a really horrible storyline and lazy writing. The effects that give life to dinosaurs (a combination of puppets and animatronics, as well as computer graphics and sequences of images from Raptor Planet) are among the worst effects I've seen in a low-budget movie. The gore effects are not even convincing. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a group of commandos who, for some reason (I forget why), go to a planet of extraterrestrial dinosaurs. That's right, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in space. What's next, sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. Human actors are kidnapped and eaten. We are now expecting this in the many dinosaur movies and novels, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I've seen where I've been bored of all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> There are however some laughs. There is a scene that stands out in which a man is crunched by a Carnotaur (animated by footage from the original film) which, a few seconds later, becomes a giant raptor. Also, a little triviality is the scene where Steven Baur turns his own scene of the death of the first film. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie to begin with, it's a masterpiece compared to its sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I tell you that this is probably the worst Syfy movie ever aired. It's damn almost unassailable.
