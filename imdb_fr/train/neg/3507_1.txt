The Maysles brothers have reached a low point of human interaction with this film. Remember, you who used words such as "masterpiece" when re-reading this movie, that these fears of Maysles did not come to lead the Hamptons and to shoot movies about eccentric people. No, when they found these two pathetic poor people, they then had to finance their project (and imagine what they told people money to sell the project). Then they became friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of mind here or real consensual participation. These miserable Maysles were smiling, kissing their ass, doing everything in their power to bring the Beales to cooperate, and then exploiting them as ferociously as ever. One would like to think that these prostitutes sometimes had thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the process of making the film, taking into account the prior planning, actual filming and editing took a lot of time and their purpose had no provision to really relate to the Beales as human beings. A film of exploitation perpetrated by the most vile of men. Over time, their reputation as a director has been seriously tarnished by what they have done here. Their reputation as a human being is execrable. That's what people will remember. Grotesque hunters.
