THE BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Not a slasher or filled with gore. Lots of broken glass and mirrors in this provocative French thriller and screenwriter / director Sean Ellis. Gina McVay (Lena Headly), a renowned radiologist, meets a strange world while her life seems to be out of control. While attending the birthday party of his father (Richard Jenkins), the guests are stunned when a mirror hangs on the ground for no obvious reason. Things get really strange when she sees a woman who is just like herself driving on a London street in a car identical to his own. Gina sneaks into her doppelganger's apartment and finds a picture of her with her father. She moves away and is involved in a frontal collision. Then, mysteriously, her boyfriend is not the same. To be exact, his family and friends are not easy to trust. Is Gina alone? Is she in a parallel world? Her nightmares become more horrible ... is she broken? <br /> <br /> Well done if you can understand this one ... it will not be easy. The assembly could not be more tight. The lighting is debatable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
