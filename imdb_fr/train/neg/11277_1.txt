There is no doubt that the distribution of this film is impressive, but unfortunately, it does not help the major drawbacks of the film. I never understand why filmmakers ask actors to use accents that are not theirs when it's obvious to everyone that they can not convince. Fiennes simply can not do Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is bad, then whatever the acting, the character will never be convincing. Regarding the major problem, the plot, was it one? I guess there was some kind of scenario involved but there were so many holes that I could not wait for the movie to end ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
