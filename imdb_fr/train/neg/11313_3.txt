and it is useless in the case of Rohmer that a few years later, Syberberg arrived and did a staggering job on the same subject (with the help of Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie does not have It does not look so derisory when it came out without the Syberberg movie with which it was compared, which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources. In fact, I do not remember at the moment if there are horses in the movie Syberberg. All I know is that the German version is pure magic, whereas it looks like a university film production documented for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> music ... music ... is not even credited here on IMDb ... but someone based it on "twelfth to fourteenth-century tunes" or whatever something like that ... well, it's not a big help for the movie. It is as inauthentic and corny, as my message shows !!! <br /> <br /> rohmer is one of those French writers who also loves his bosses who are generally unattractive and do not help things. The Parsifal from Syberberg was adorable and can be seen on German television selling some kind of special bike that he invented ... <br /> <br /> I shudder at the idea of ​​watching the syberberg video. I remember that the last time I saw the movie in a theater, the imprint was so bad that the experience was a huge parody of 5 hours, but even in this case, it should exceed what this version has to offer, I fear. <br /> <br /> for chutzpah, but ... this movie just needed more shots. it does not look like a medieval manuscript, but CHEAPO! CHEAP !! oh and yeah, it just ends up very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and that nerdy game of passion being interjected ... blah!
