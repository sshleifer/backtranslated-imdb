What a desappointment! <br /> <br /> This film seemed to attempt to copy a "high-tech" comedy, but the direction and scenario were sloppy, sickly and sentimental in the worst cinematographic tradition. The role and role of Jack Black was selfish and selfish ... and the other characters were just as old-fashioned and uninteresting. The soundtrack was tedious. We are (WERE) fans of Black but none of us managed to manage a forced titter for the duration. Why did he feel he had to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not see any other of his films without reading the reviews more carefully beforehand! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read script before signing up for this drivel?
