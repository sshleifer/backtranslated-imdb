Anita and Me seems little more than an excuse for Meera Syal, the author of the novel and script, which allows her to express her prejudices, her grievances and her general antipathy towards the English. The general feeling of Indian superiority towards the English in this film is rude. <br /> <br /> The English in this film are portrayed as being overweight, violent, voiceless, without promises, indulging in childless, stupid, uneducated. , racist, ugly, eating poor quality food and having a weak mind - which is revealing, it is only by relying on Indian culture that the local priest can be "redeemed" at the end of the film . <br /> <br /> Indian families are beautiful, intelligent, educated, can speak several languages, are caring and loving parents and a fodder for high schools. The film is so insidiously prejudicial that I am surprised that the BBC funded it. If it had been the opposite, an English family in an Indian community was represented as well, the film would have been considered racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when my eyebrow pulled so far on my forehead, I thought it would lodge in my hair. First, the gossip scene between women at the Divali celebration - subtext: the English are dirty and promiscular - and men - subtext: English women are prostitutes. Secondly, the meal with Anita where Neema's family was lying to her about the cutlery - the underlying thing: the English are so stupid that you can make them do anything. <br /> <br /> But the underlying contempt for everything English - even English weddings are an object of disdain - is evident throughout the film. The character of Anita was drawn so dreadfully - almost the trope of the fallen woman - that I finished the film angrily. <br /> <br /> This is not a "Bend it like Beckham" where humor is centered on the love of exaggerations of the behavior and customs of a community on the part of someone from this community, and it's a film about two girls from different backgrounds meeting each other. Instead, Anita and I seem to indicate that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, the English being almost a version of the Untouchable Indian caste, which is evidenced by a series of thinly veiled attacks against the "other" film community: the English. <br /> <br /> I thought that Anita and I were hate-inspired and grievance-based. On this basis, the BBC should not have financed its production.
