Perhaps one of the most overrated horror classics of all time, Halloween contains the memorable Michael Myers and some excellent actors from Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its re-writability factor is very close to zero, there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on monotony / the culmination of real events. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can leave in the microwave popcorn without missing anything. <br /> <br /> As it has generated so many consequences, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Rob Zombie is doing this again. And in general, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> It will surely more than compensate for all random deviations with unusual points of interest that are sorely lacking to the original. <br /> <br /> This is a film we feel we should like, much like we have learned SHOULD appreciate Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not assume it's a classic.
