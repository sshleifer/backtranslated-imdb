What a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes also had a good rating. do not be fooled by positive comments; It was not scary. It was not funny. It was not smart. This will not even hold your attention. I just lost 2 hours of my life watching this crappy party. the computer-generated monster was interesting to see the first two times. after about 15 minutes he was no longer entertained. the dialogue was terrible, must be a translation thing. Another negative point that came out was the idiot Americans. 3 were depicted and all lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now, I'm going to write a few lines to correct that, because we have to have 10. The video store staff should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter.
