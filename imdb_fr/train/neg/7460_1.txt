Corky Romano must be one of the most terrible and horrible "comedies" ever created. <br /> <br /> While Chris Kattan, sometimes amusing, made a very funny performance in the hilarious character of "Undercover Brother" Corky is so stupid and so funny - which is a shame because the premise is an idea wonderful. Too bad they missed when they came to page 3 of the script.
