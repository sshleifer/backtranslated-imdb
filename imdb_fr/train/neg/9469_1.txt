Audrey, I know you really cherish the memory of your husband, Ted, but please, do justice to his legacy and consider his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters in his lifetime for a very good reason. Please stop using your stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are boned by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be grappling with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books. <br /> <br /> It's really your property to do as you wish. I would like you to listen to the advice of others for a little while. Save what's left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
