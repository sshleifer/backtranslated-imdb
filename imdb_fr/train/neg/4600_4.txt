I read all these reviews about the quality of this film. God, this movie was predictable and rather boring. The acting was below average most of the time, especially Mckenna. I did not see a more pathetic attempt to make someone "badass" in a movie. Oh man, this movie was disappointing. I also read somewhere that this could be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this film was just an average piece of film. <br /> <br /> The scenario was lame, most of the time, the acting was nil, this film was nil. > <br /> Oh and pray for the guy who was in Cheers. He looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the character of Office Space, and he only stayed there for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
