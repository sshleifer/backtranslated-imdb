This is a small, honest show about the paranormal, although it seems that Art Bell and his ilk have discovered how to make a career out of the attitude of Carl Kolchak as an example. Of course, there would probably be no X-Files if this series had not prepared this audience for that. Darren McGavin is not really a super-heroic type, but it's a plausible type (enough) to perform heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of these old Alfred Hitchcock gifts. Here it is the main attraction, there does not seem to be a girlfriend or a woman who is a distraction. In fact, there is not much sex appeal in the series. What I also notice is that the pace is not really typically suspensive. There is a lot of disposable humor in this show. Sometimes it's just pokey to reach the climax. There is a thread of this show that goes to the current show of MAD MEN in terms of style. Not that David Chase wrote Mad Men, but the people who worked for him on The Sopranos have definitely imitated and inherited his sero-comic tone.
