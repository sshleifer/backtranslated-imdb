If you want to be offended or amused, or both, you will probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really does not have the slightest thought that can provoke beyond the repetition of the usual stupid clich√©s. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed to find that I was sitting in the artificial mess. <br /> <br /> Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise, she has drawn all the initial attention that attaches to him. a cautious, innocuous and anti-septic attempt to comment and entertain that CBC / Radio-Canada generally excels at producing. And once the "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURMAO RURAL CANADA ROUR !!" the hype pays off, the show is likely to keep pace with the cancellation, as it is so superficial that if judged solely on the merits. <br /> <br /> Unless you are obsessed with Muslim culture in the West and / or are easily amused by the tiniest idiosyncrasies on the subject, I really do not see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfy the curiosity arising from the hype. Other programs have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multiethnic societies. LMOTP will never be among them in entertainment or vision.
