if my grandmother shot movies, they would probably make a much better number than that one ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are doing well. Especially the mother, she is a beautiful actress and the kid turns out to be a nice guy especially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary. But does the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script? the scenario did not evolve to become a suspense. If you like being chased by trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay home and sleep. oh ... in fact, there was something fun: the movie dates from 2001 but we could not realize it because the picture is so bad (as on mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like the 70s and 80s).
