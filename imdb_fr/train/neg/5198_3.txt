It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but I really do not remember seeing a worse movie. I thought it would be an investigation into a plane crash. What it really was was a soap opera and a bad opera. They played the card of "conflict" too much. The first hour or so sounds like a screaming match with some unlikely scenes. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler possible * <br /> <br /> The memorial scene of about forty minutes (black umbrellas needed and rain) to the fictitious victims of the accident was lame, and I I thought that would never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid it at all costs, unless you enjoy a "conflict". <br /> <br />
