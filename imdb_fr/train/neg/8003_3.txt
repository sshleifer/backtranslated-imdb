Do not be deceived as I have been by the "complimentary" critics cited on the DVD box. "Delightfully entertaining.", "A truly scary phenomenon.", And the worst of all, "ON WITH WITH JAWS." This film is not part of the above. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not care about writing bad movie reviews, but I can not believe that this one is based on a comfortable 7 on IMDb. He does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> After an attack of the first hour of such a monster created by another monster created by what, chemicals spilled by lazy scientists, this film goes absolutely nowhere and it goes slowly . Roughly and improbably, a girl gets caught by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature drawing but it's not a WETA creation) and her semi-comic family spends an hour and a half at the hunt down ... in the sewers surrounding the Han River. Their research lacks suspense - again, someone called it tied with Jaws? - and when they found it, you realized that all this was rather useless. Apart from that, much of the film is linked to a government quarantine that ends in a fun scene featuring a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. It was bad. I am not joking. Want to see a movie about the rotten monster? Rent Deep Rising. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.
