This will help you understand the extraordinary effort he has devoted to the material, as well as the controversy surrounding both the book and the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, I only gave a 4 because I save the bottom 3 ranking for the real bombs - the kind that outrages you for being sucked into spending a
