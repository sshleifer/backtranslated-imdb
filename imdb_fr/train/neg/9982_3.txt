The story begins slowly and nothing funny happens for a moment. All the action is over, but you will not have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is when Harvey "I'm not paranoid" Keitel really loses him and the judge starts a massacre. Oscars for this guy!
