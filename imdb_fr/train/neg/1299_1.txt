This production has absolutely no scenario. The acting is embarrassing. The promising Dutch TV star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this film to her CV. Her game is far from irreproachable and personally, I think she has exceeded the limits of professional decency; about how she exposes herself in this film. This film contains too much useless nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and foul language. It also shows a mistaken picture of the Netherlands (as most movies do). Do not bother watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing disc for Hilbrand, who has been better with her on the screen.
