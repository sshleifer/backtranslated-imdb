Since I started visiting this site and voting for movies, I have never rated a movie as 1. Even the disturbing "Dance! Workout with Barbie" got a 2. There is a reason for that. <br /> Whenever I find myself watching what I think is really a bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "Is this movie really as bad as the terrible beast that sucks the soul that is "Theodore Rex"? "and I have never been able to answer" yes ". <br /> <br /> I would give anything to know what crackhead said "Hey, let's do" Blade Runner "with Barney in the role of Harrison Ford!" and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money needed to film it. In addition, I want to know what kind of market they would sell their product if he had not gone directly to the video. It is this rare monster: a film too violent for the children and too stupid for the adults. I would ask "what did they think?" but in this case, it could even be redundant. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all you need to know is that you should expose yourself to this monstrosity only if you're one of the five or six mad fans of "Howard the Duck ", or if you are curious to see the most devilish movie of all time, or if you REALLY want to punish yourself.
