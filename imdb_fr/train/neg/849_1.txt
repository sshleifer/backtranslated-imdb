A star. That's all this documentary deserves. I did not feel so disappointed watching a movie, let alone a documentary, for some time. <br /> <br /> I'm a GREAT fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel Marvin's spin-offs, despite their amusing and fun info at once. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject remains interesting and unique to explore. After seeing all the other documentaries in the series, I thought I needed to see this one too, especially after reading good reviews in other places. <br /> <br /> Good for those of you who post a good review. from this doc ... what were you thinking ?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they could get is interesting, the presentation failed in any way possible. His flow was terrible, he was incredibly fuzzy in what he was trying to say (with scrambled and sometimes misplaced information), horrible effects (which include the CGI moments and especially the makeup effects), and a MTV style too much used camera effects. <br /> <br /> On the effects of make-up, one commentator said how ludicrous the scene was when the cavemen fell on this giant monkey and gave the impression that it looked a lot like a movie. horror featuring a man of the 70s. Well, there are plenty of moments like those where people describing ape men seemed ridiculous and ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible positions and camera compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that none of this is shown interestingly or dynamically, or looks very far away. It does not even seem to have been taken seriously. The predecessors of the series also lacked any emotion. Do you remember the episode "Walking with dinosaurs" of the fate of the ornithochirus (sp?)? This episode keeps me on the verge of tears every time I look at him. This is the kind of engagement with the subject that is missing most here. When you are more engaged in the subject and it is a personal story, even speculative, you care more about the facts that surround it. <br /> <br /> The only things that save this production are the pretty good narration (at least in the BBC version I saw) and the music. Otherwise, do not even bother renting this one unless you want to laugh (which I used to do often, but usually followed by big rolled eyes). This does not belong to the shelf with the other documents "Walking With ...". <br /> <br /> And does it make sense to learn that this document has NOT been produced or is not directly related to the same people in the series? Hmmm ...
