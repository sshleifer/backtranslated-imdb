"A young woman suffers from the illusion of being a werewolf, based on the family legend of an ancestor accused and killed for being one, and has been treated by men and furrowed and killed men she meets Falling in love with a nice man, her life seems to improve when she gets raped and her lover is killed by a gang of thugs Traumatized again by these events, the woman resumes her behavior Rino Di Silvestro's "Lupa mannara" begins with a frontal, moaning, whimpering dance performed by blond blonde Annik Borel, who (under the name of Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf The hottest part occurs when the camera catches fire between his legs, the flashback reveals that his hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature, but Borel is not a werewolf simply a very strong alien . <br /> <br /> As a movie, "Werewolf Woman" (in English) would have been better if the character Borel was actually a werewolf; with his sexual victimization a great characterization. But since skin and blood flow in the 70's, it's hard to beat it. Bouncy Borel is either naked or sexy dressed throughout the movie, which contains a good amount of free gore. Dazzmar Lassander (as Elena) and Howard Ross (as Luca) are good support players.
