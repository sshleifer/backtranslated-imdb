This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim conspiracy. And I am Jewish. <br /> <br /> Can we go to journalism school? Read an editorial? First-year rhetoric? These alarmist claims, presented in an acceptable way, could be convincing. But by offering no recognition of possible opposing arguments or viable solutions (or no solution at all), few sources and each of questionable origin make the argument an inefficient diatribe. <br /> <br /> And, thank God, I would not want anyone leaving the theater, CONSCIOUS of this racist trap. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and I hope a telling story for you - to read a movie before seeing it. .
