If you want to see a belated homosexual karate expert beating a gang of Mexican gangsters who want to hurt themselves, then here's the movie for you. if not, choose another DVD in trash 20c, the only place this movie belongs to. the game was so horrible that I had to force myself to watch it all the way. The cover looks so cool but it's just another Grade B b-gangster movie, in the style of 2g, with a key, a bloody street and a threat. I will not buy or rent this film unless you intend to smash and conspire, ride and act as it does not matter to you. it's really the worst film in the history of humanity !!!
