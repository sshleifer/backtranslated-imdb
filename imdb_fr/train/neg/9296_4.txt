Normally, I am a fairly generous critic, but in the case of this film, I must say that it was incredibly bad. I am amazed at how much of the reviews seem positive. <br /> <br /> There have been great photos, but it's a shame they were wasted in this chasm of a film. It could have worked if "Daggers" was purely an action movie and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between couples, all that exists between Mei and his men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part, the dialogue is just silly. It may be just a translation problem, but the frequent use of the word "flirting" in particular reminded me of Grade 8, not head-to-head, together forever, a love that is worth the pain of dying; I also felt that we were beaten on the head with the metaphor of the wind. The audience is not interested in the characters that really need to be cared for, and as a result, they invest very little emotionally in the film. I wanted a remote control to move quickly. I was slumped in my seat, ready to snore, but most of the time, I just collapsed. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, add insult to injury. The end was really one of the most horrible and laughable I've ever seen. Boys argue, scream, scream and blame each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly pops weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach her destination, even by conveniently slowing the middle screen to hit a small drop of blood. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Well, then Mei finally dies, I suppose, because she threw the dagger that lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds his body against her, the screen turns white. Me and the people around me are laughing. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually beautiful, but ultimately a failure.
