I could not believe I had spent $ 14.00 for that. The only quality that redeems is the scandalous gore. The dubbing was worse than anything I've ever known. It looks like it was shot with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, but I have to recognize the abundant gore that was not as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so stupid and amazing
