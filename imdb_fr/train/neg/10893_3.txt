This is one of those movies that should have been much better than it turned out. I dread to think of what the Blockbuster approved editing must have looked like, because the DVD director's cut was a bother of epic proportions. Of course, you do not expect it to be "The Godfather", but a comedian class might be useful. <br /> <br /> There were also a lot of cute guys in this movie, but they were unfortunately underused. I like watching a lot of sluts who tremble in their BVD as much as the other guys, but even I have the right to wait a little more. It was not a total loss, however; At least we had a glimpse of Drew Fuller's junk (covered) and his really disturbing haircut. And there is Huntley Ritter who looks even cuter than in "Bring It On" (and who plays too). There is always a ray of hope, children. You just have to look very hard for that. And occasionally you have to use your pause button.
