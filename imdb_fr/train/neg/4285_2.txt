If you want to buy a good movie from Jason Scott Lee, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: the story of Bruce Lee <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> < "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision" is a horrible movie. Horrific production values. Bad game. Horrible script. I would not recommend this film to a person who seriously believes that this kind of tripe is quality entertainment or advances the notoriety of Asian Americans in Hollywood (this film does not do it either). <br /> <br /> I would at least say that this film is a fair entertainment on a rainy day if you meet him while surfing on a channel. If you are curious, maybe a Netflix rental, but this movie is definitely not for keeping it. <br /> <br /> If you're one of the few people who watched this movie as a way to boost its profile as an Asian-American movie, and left disappointed, then I recommend the following movies for your viewing staff. These are well-written films with high production values ​​that showcase a talented Asian American actors: <br /> <br /> A better chance for tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
