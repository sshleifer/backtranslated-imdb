Ben, a policeman in the city, is convinced that his sister was brutally murdered and wants to bring his murderer to justice, but he is approached by Stefan who thinks his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. Ben, his sister's best friend, and Stefan go to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> This is an unbelievably terrible class B thing, and I wondered how he was released. The original "Howling" looks like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, since it must be his worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of problems with this really cheap movie, ranging from the really martial and wooden performances of Annie McEnroe, Brown Reb, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forget Lee ), fashion cheesy (these sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, humor ... if there was one, 80's trash music (some of the film concentrating only on an unknown band playing), werewolf orgies are a sight to behold and a boring story with a flat and boring dialogue. I thought that if it was so bad, it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positives were the location and the settings of the movie looked great, but that's about it ... In fact, I'll also add Sybil Danning, short scene of striptease. <br /> <br /> During the end credits, the band plays its crap-house song during a strange montage of scenes from the film, what makes me say why? <br /> <br /> A terrible mess, but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
