A woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive. The deceitful husband wants her death and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking it in a coffin and leaving it in the basement. Well on the queen of the horror film Brinke Stevens turns into a hideous ghostly creature. reason to see this amateur stitching movie is Michael Berryman in a very little cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard.And the last twenty minutes of the bloody destruction of Brinke are fun enough to watch.The special effects for example beheaded head are really awful. Better watch "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I do not expect a chic entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too dull to be nice.
