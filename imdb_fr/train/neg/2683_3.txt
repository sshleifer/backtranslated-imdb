Have you ever wondered what would happen if two Beverly Hills 90210 characters were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, it's your movie. It's Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be nice, but the story was poorly executed. Complex twists, poor dialogue and unresolved problems abound. This light film did not deserve the right to be as encrypted as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and incredibly absurd parcel line - the moment of false tension when the hotel employee discovers that the girls have no room and are about to evict them. (This moment is needlessly played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are stopped with a firearm). Later, the same employee of the hotel is found - and Bangkok is a big city, notice it, and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of Mai Tais free had been sentenced to 40 years in prison. Let's go there. Rent another day in paradise instead.
