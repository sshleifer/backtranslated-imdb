This film had potential and I wanted to try it, but there are so many chronological issues that are so obvious: it's hard to swallow being treated like an idiot. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power is installed in the late sixties. Carlito's Way takes place in the seventies. For this film to be realistic, it should be shot in the fifties, if not in the late forties. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando with whom Carlito would have run with his "hello". None of the main characters in the original movie were part of this movie. We are supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in a few years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power ends with Carlito coming down the beach to talk about his retirement in paradise, what he wanted to do. in the original movie. In addition, the pre-which creates the characters of Rocco and Earl - what is supposed to happen to them since they are clearly not in Carlito's Way? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he maintains in the original film by watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and he is spending five in prison. It's like trying to place a square plug in a round hole. <br /> <br /> Obviously no one wanted to tell a good story and was more interested in making money by making an average gangster movie. and throw a character called Carlito Brigante in the story. The film had some good times, but I think they would have done better to let this film go by itself instead of trying to make it a premise of Carlito's Way. <br /> <br /> If you are determined to see this film The only advice I can give is not to consider the film as a pre-what linear. Think of it as spaghetti westerns with the unnamed Clint Eastwood man, in other words, two films that have the same character but are not necessarily related.
