1 st watched 07/11/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): A nice lame gangster movie about a godfather-like family in Brooklyn who likes to say four-letter words and kill people. The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds that they looked a lot like the gang. This is the only good movie attempt. The rest of the film was predictable and cheaply made. The quality of the photography in some scenes inside bars and fuzzy joints almost made you think that your DVD player was a problem because of the bad contrasts and that some actors were difficult to hear sometimes because of the bad sound . The cast of actors represented just about every character in your favorite gangsters from better movies with dumb names such as Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the plot also followed these patterns. So, go see a better gangster movie before putting your money for this one.
