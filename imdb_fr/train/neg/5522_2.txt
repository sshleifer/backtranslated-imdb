I was looking for the right words to describe this movie. At first, I was inclined to simply jump to more meaningful subjects, as the film did not reach a level of comment worthy of the name. <br /> <br /> Yet I stopped, perplexed as to the description of this kind of things and somewhat puzzled by the challenge presented by the question: "What can be said about such a movie?" Garbage? No, it's not garbage, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, it's not a greenhouse gas, but greenhouse gases help plants grow healthy and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, I chose "Not even bad", a reworking of the phrase "Not even wrong" used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory imperfectly imperfect and that does not even need to be corrected . That's it, Georgia Rule: Not even bad.
