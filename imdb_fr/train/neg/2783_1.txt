Some time ago, I visited one of my parents and passed a theater. So we had thought to come in and try this movie. What an error! This film is awful in all departments. I had never heard of the film before and almost everyone has not done it yet. No wonder, it's as good as possible. It's a comedy, they say, the only fun thing is the ability, or not, of the director to make such a film. As we approach Christmas, we should know how to cook a turkey in less than an hour and a half - or whatever the length of his stay, when leaving home. At the end of the movie, you will feel like you have been poisoned by a sick turkey and you will regret wasting time with such a dribble. Who knows why such things are done. Some people were out of the theater before the end of the film and I blame myself for not going out much sooner. It really annoys me that you're paying a lot of money to see something decent, and all you see is a TV movie that should be aired at 2 o'clock in the morning. should not show it. What else can I say ... probably not enough bad words could do it justice.
