I just finished watching this movie and realized that it was not really funny at all. <br /> <br /> I am an RPG player (computer type, no table games DnD), but I have not found any joke. in this funny scene. <br /> <br /> Some scenes seemed to go on forever (the tilt and zoom could have been reduced to 5 seconds instead of over a minute) and it seems that the director I'm just trying to win time. <br /> <br /> I think I have laughed a total of 2 or 3 times in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game itself was not so bad, around the norm that a category B movie should have. <br /> <br /> I would advise you not to bother with this movie, unless you're a big fan of DnD and even then it probably would be best to avoid it.
