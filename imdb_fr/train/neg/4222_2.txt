For those of us who have experienced these weeks of filming in town and in the valley, let's not forget the tedious days of road closures and "filming". As a reminder to those who live here, Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin are just some of the places to visit. etc. The bank was the fire station in British Columbia; Moon Drive on Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1 <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most accessible, Matt Broderick was above us, even back then. As for the movie - a scenario joke and even a bigger laugh about acting and intrigue - but who cares about this level. A nice weather capsule for those who love our coast and our valley landscape. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the movie), his original name was "Welcome to Buzzsaw" - the Old Erba's parking lot was the town square, the backyard shots were from Grove Street to Boulder Creek; turn off the thinking ability and see some actors in their infancy.
