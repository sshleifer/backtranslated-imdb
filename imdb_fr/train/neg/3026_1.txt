supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey, a model turned bounty hunter. I would say that 95% is manufactured. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this film lost its chances when it became obvious that there was a narrative throughout the film, something that I can not stand, and to top it off, the heroine of the story is so hateful and portrays herself as an arrogant b! I just wanted it to end with his bullet in the head. it's too incoherent, too flashy and too boring, it's one that gives a shitty story, and I really think that big filmmakers need to make movies based on their own imagination or on that of a writer, not something based on the life of an ignorant bastard.
