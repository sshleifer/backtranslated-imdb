Comes this comforting story of hope. I hope you will never bear anything so awful. * cough * price Razzie * cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it was not funny, predictable and inept. Looking at it, I felt like in a psychology experiment to determine how bad a standard movie could be before people complained. When I asked for my money back at the end of the film, I was informed that because I had watched everything, I was not entitled to a refund. The deputy director told me that several people had already complained and had already been reimbursed. <br /> <br /> The summary of the film is rather basic. The thief steals a diamond and puts it like a baby to escape the police. However, in this intelligent form, there is a repertoire of original skits, fresh and hilarious. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following questions: Do you like to see people being hit by pots and pans? Do you like pet jokes? Do you like to see dwarves posing as threatened babies with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Drooling you? <br /> <br /> If you answered "yes" to any of the questions above, this movie is for you. Although it has been featured in some places as "The Worst Movie of the Decade," there is probably one or two films that are worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave 2 stars to this film because we all know that a critique with a single star would indicate a bias on the part of the critic and that the criticism would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is for a less intelligent audience and I can not, in all conscience, recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
