I saw Chan Is Missing on her first outing, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. It may have been the prospect of a few years to come, but this film seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything I had ever seen (still does). It focuses on one community in particular - the Chinese - but it's okay, because much of the soul of the city is refracted through the sets, the faces and perhaps especially the voices of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not San Francisco tourists. The sets are humble and everyday: a taxi, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, Richmond District townhouses, small Chinatown apartments and small offices, jetties, a senior citizen center in the Philippines. This is what the city looks and feels like for people living there - even now, in the era of Silicon Gulch's urban redevelopment. Unlike Dirty Harry (in his own way, an excellent San Francisco film), everything is filmed at the street level: we come to understand the point of view of the characters from the point of view that their environment offers them, and not a whimsical vertigo shoot. <br /> <br /> Wang apparently shot in black and white because he did not have the money to do otherwise, but one of the most powerful visuals of the film is the natural light it product. The often painful and ubiquitous sun quality is one of my closest associations with San Francisco: it seems to expose everything, bringing buildings, hills and other landmarks to scale and, amusingly, Getting the people you meet on the streets seems more individual and potentially closer to you than they could elsewhere. Wang's photography perfectly reflects that, and even helps the story at times. <br /> <br /> Wang captures the style of conversation and conversation of the Chinese and other Franciscans in San better than anyone, I think. If there is a real "accent" in San Francisco, "that's what the bald taxi driver (I think) says on the phone in a scene (listen to how he calls the person on the other end ") ya dingaling! "). <br /> <br /> The story is poignant and, despite a few very small mistakes, it is a wonderful reflection of the desires of those living in the old immigrant communities - including political resentments. and ethnic and small ironic amusements that feed them.This is communicated gently - maybe why some respondents think the film winds.This is not enough - just say that Chan's quest for the two taxi drivers becomes a quest for something more personal. <br /> <br /> Chan Is Missing ends with a sequence of Chinatown travel tales accompanied by a foolish fancy song from the 1930s (I guess) on San Francisco and all its crazy diversity, an American caricature, certainly, but not completely false either.
