This movie was really bad. Since science fiction is usually my favorite channel, I watch all the original films that are shown on it. I really do not know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island seems quite familiar. What was it, oh yeah, Jurassic Park. But the Sabertooth tigers instead. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some college stereotypes on an island doing a kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying of a rather macabre death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood was a lot like ketchup. Also at the beginning, there is a scientist who wants to create as many saber-tooth tigers as the public can appreciate. 3 of them have already escaped and are going to eat tourists or guests on the island to see the tigers. Again, sounds like Jurassic Park. The coolest thing was probably the 1,000-pounder saber tooth that crawled on his front legs, killing the mad scientist with a tooth-shaped statue that narrows and passes into the men's necks. The funniest death I saw on TV. <br /> <br /> The acting is extremely old-fashioned, the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models, and even some of the sounds were off. For example, when a student tries to escape, he uses an ax to break a door. The ax enters the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was really bad. The cheese deaths were pretty funny though.
