The main problem with "Power" is that it contains useless characters and secondary intrigues that add absolutely nothing to the movie. It gets boring after a while, sitting waiting for scenes that do not connect to find something that moves the movie forward. You could probably get that done for character development, but they're all recycled from previous scenes in the movie, or just too flat and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to let one of the people who support her bloom. He should have cut some characters (the pirate, the wife) and focus more on the others (Billings). It could have been a hard and tough political thriller instead of a confused mess that loses all message in an ocean of bad script and acting, a fact that amazed me by considering the cast. Even Gene Hackman's performances were not up to par. Denzel Washington is the only actor to note here. Gere and the others have all done much better elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet must return to the fierce exhibition he did in the seventies (ie Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success with "12 Angry Men "and" Fail Safe ". Sidney has not worked yet and will probably never do it. leave the overall dramas to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
