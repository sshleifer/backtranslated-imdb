The film that turns scenes of a tour of picturesque caves. <br /> <br /> Do not forget anyone in this film, except for Michael Pataki who overcame extreme pain as JC in "Five the Hard Way". This is the really annoying sheriff I applauded when he practices the baton on our enraged doctor. Probably the most laughter you'll have is with Dr. Beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere. Could Mrs. Beck be more wood? Seriously, if you took a 4-foot branch, if you planted it in a hot tub, you would not notice a difference. Terror and suspense are watching the clock wondering when the credits will arrive. <br /> <br /> Watch it as a late-night movie, MSTified, but do not stray.
