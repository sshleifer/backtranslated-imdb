This film must be online for the most boring movie in years. Even Woody Harrison can not stop this film from sinking into darkness. <br /> <br /> The assassination of this film is supposed to be the point of interest of this film but it is not, there is no interest. The actors are not that bad, but the scenario is simply awful, I sat in total astonishment during this movie, thinking that no one could find this entertaining movie <br /> <br /> Producers of this movie were very smart. They made a boring film but hid it with the names of good actors and actresses in their casting. People go to the blockbuster and will probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe that must be good and praise this movie. (They are in a horrible moment) <br /> <br /> If you like being ripped off, rent this movie, there are people who have enjoyed it, but I like to watch a film that makes sense.
