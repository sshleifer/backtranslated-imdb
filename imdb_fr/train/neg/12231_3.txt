I saw this film and was sometimes upset to believe that this movie "saw me". Munchie defiles the farce for years to come. Watch Star Wars again, do not look at Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I'm talking to those who are parents now), I would not let my (your) child ever participate in this pseudo-occult video festival. Insinuating that Munchie is satanic, for a co-spectator, is likely to cause a frightening "duh". He is demonic, extraterrestrial, racist and utterly malevolent - like Bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years denial of self and prudent management). He is a peddler of easy answers and false ideals. It is all that the morally conscious viewer is not. He is the devil's own, Ron Popeil. <br /> <br /> I pray (I mean this literally and figuratively, with a focus on the first) that this film did not make the format DVD format. I hope this type of "yellow shoot" died of a sad death in the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizzas. I forgot to mention that. It comes back often.
