I have already seen other movies about the guinea pig, like Mermaid in Man & Hone Never Dies, and even if they are sick enough, they have at least a little sense of humor (whatever their image). Devil's Experiment, however, is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks who subject a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and that there is no conspiracy or redeeming value. It's not very scary, except maybe for the mind, but it's disgusting and I would not call it entertainment. Now, I'm not the paragon of good taste in movies and I love my trash, but it's too much for me, really. In fact, I'm looking for things that bother me as much as possible, but it was a little too much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, subjected to continuous noise from the helmet until she drools, then is pounded with raw meat and viscera and left hanging in a hammock somewhere in the area. wood. If you think that sounds good, go ahead, but it certainly discourages me to look at more things about the guinea pig. 1 of 10, absolutely nauseating.
