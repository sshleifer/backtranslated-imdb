Alfred Hitchcok is by no means my favorite director, but imagine what he could have done with that! The plot has a lot of potential for suspense. John Garfield is as always almost excellent and Raymond Massey is counter-typed. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading actress, but the secondary cast is large and very competent. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts to subside pretty soon. There are too many coincidences. And an important subject is trivialized by the fact that it is transformed into a little more, in the end, than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey and the characters perform. But it's not terribly good.
