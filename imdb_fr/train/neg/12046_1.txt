I had high hopes for Troy and I am very bitterly disappointed. The film was made so badly that I had a stomach ache. The pace was so slow, the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a beautiful battle scene between Achille (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was superficial. <br /> <br /> And why, oh why Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories based on "consumer approval". Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUT of the walls of Troy with an arrow at the ankle! It makes me angry to see such a classic story in a soap. <br /> <br /> And do not even throw me on the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman on whom the war was over and he did not even seem to care that the two cared very much for each other. No sparks, no emotion, no hope. <br /> <br /> I must say that in the defense of the Brad Pitt films, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole have done very well with a bad script, but that is not enough to save this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the Â£ 200 million budget has gone? Maybe in all the trees used for funeral pyres - where did they find all these trees? <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed that it hurts me.
