Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> > Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Not a good reason not to see this movie .... <br /> <br /> Or so I thought ........ Do not these people do JBJ ... <br /> <Why / or did I forget that? <br /> <br /> Despite all the criticism, the first half of the movie is not that bad ... <br /> <br /> You feel a kind of irritation mixed with excitement that I feel when I see Guy Ritchie's films like Lock Stock and Snatch. <br /> <br /> Kareena sizzles very thinly. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as he alone can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying but funny, you almost forget that, but you can not understand it. <br /> <br /> Saif is at his side at the Khiladi Hand ... again. <br /> <br /> From time to time there are some laughter and laughter, and some goosebumps during the kareena-saif love story (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm). <br /> <br /> BUT THESE ARE MORE PROMISE OF WHAT DOES NOT BOOK ..... WHAT MAKES THE SECOND HALF MORE INDISPENSABLE .... <br /> <br /> There was almost a joy when the interval came not just because of the wet kareena because of what people thought if things would happen. <br /> <br /> INSTEAD, WE HAVE BEEN ALSO TASTED TO DELAY DIGITAL TORTURE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT WORDS. <br /> <br /> Saif suddenly sewed up like a comic sidekick ... <br /> <br /> REMEMBER, THE SEXY KAREENA IS ANOREXIC, YOU REALIZE THAT THE SECOND LAST FLOOR IS NOW EMPTY AND ITS FACE TO A LARGE FACE FOR HER BODY (only girls can notice it and point out to others that the second floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOOR AND SIDEKICKS ARE MISSING ON YOUR NERVES. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one to have carried the madness to a certain extent, but it became intolerable after a while. <br /> <br /> ALL THAT YOU ARE SUBI TO ABSORBITY AFTER THE OTHER. <br /> <br /> WHY ?? !! WHAT??!!! WHEN?!!! OR?!!! WHAT I HAD TO CHALLENGE THIS ... <br /> <br /> A collective blast appeared in front of the audience before each song of the second half of the series, which was ordinary even without the film that surroundings. <br /> <br /> I can not relieve the trauma anymore .... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM BEGINS LIKE A BUZZ THAT MAY BE LIKELY TO START AT A HIGH LEVEL BUT RUNS SLOWLY. TOWARDS A BAD HEAD, THEN QUICKLY IN A COMPLETE ATTACK OF MIGRAINE. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this film for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s what, when, how, who has a lot of confusion. (Need a book to fill this). <br /> <br /> The casting of +, the All the second half (it takes several pages to fill that). <br /> <br /> total 3/10 (I try to avoid the 1 and 2 also does not seem too extreme, but make no mistake, this film is unassailable, regardless of the quality of its decency the first half is).
