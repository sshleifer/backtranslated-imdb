I am a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is absolutely awesome and highly recommended, I was expecting a lot of Sergei Bodrov's film. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. All the movie, I was expecting something exciting, but that was not the case, so I was expecting at least a big epic battle at the end, but it was still a huge disappointment, just a few random races, waving with swords ... There are so many good warrior movies that this one is not part of it.
