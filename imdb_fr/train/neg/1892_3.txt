I read Chris_m_grant's comment from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "A fantastic documentary of 1924. This early twentieth century geography of today's Iraq was powerful." <br /> <br /> would like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in the Bakhtiari nomads of Iran, the mountains and landscapes of Zagros and who watched Grass, the battle for the life of a nation. These traditions that you saw in the film lasted for centuries and will last as long as life will last. I come from this region of Iran myself. I am a Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari area in Zardkuh is in Iran and not in Iraq, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and distinct countries. Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like taking an American for a Mexican. Thank you, <br /> <br /> Ziba
