We went in this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of `My favorite martian '. We had our 6 year old daughter with us. She wanted to leave in the middle of the film, which suited her two parents perfectly! The passages we saw were only humorous from time to time, most of the time being too stupid or disgusting. I think this movie might appeal to kids ages 9 to 12, if that happens. This is definitely not suitable for young children. From what I've heard, the original series was far superior and if you want to "relive the past", you'll probably be disappointed.
