I had a fascination for cartoon at the university when it was realized. He had a lot of the charm of "Get Smart". Admittedly, she had her faults, but she was rather nice. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was very interested in the movie version. It was before I saw it. After that, I wish it had never been done. <br /> <br /> Aside from the fact that everyone was wrong (who, even if Broderick was close to the role?), It did not make a difference. <br /> The effects were reasonable and maybe the only thing I liked in the movie; see a live version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and a treatment that made it funny, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a crazy cartoon with a very light attitude. It was fun. The film became cloudy and took itself too seriously. If she had seriously had a good plot or had become crazy enough to make a "movie cartoon", it could have been nice. <br /> <br /> As it exists, it does not deserve to be considered part of the "gadget legacy".
