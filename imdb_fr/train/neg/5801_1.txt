Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a cynical and bitter journalist who investigates the unexplained. He goes to this small town where it is said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> His car breaks down and takes refuge in a small building where he meets a beautiful mysterious girl. Suddenly, she turns into a demon and he kills her, and the city wonders who murdered this woman ... who, I suppose, was the witch but I'm not quite sure. Ivan is now pursued by his mind, or something, and he must have faith or something to defeat him. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, a stupid scenario and minimal effects. Not to mention that it is not only a Christian movie ... but also a foreign film. The dubbing actor for Ivan made the film more comical than terrorizing, because he is so sharp and whiny. You will not miss much in missing this movie.
