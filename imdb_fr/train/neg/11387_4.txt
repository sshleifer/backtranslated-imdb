Medellin is a fabulous place to live, work and study. I have been there twice and I have never heard of guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking tourists hostage or anything like that. There is an "invisible font", but it is * not * a Big Brother system. There are just enough police officers to be visible in everyday life, but they do not bother anyone without valid reasons. <br /> <br /> The Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the young people it represents in the film become essentially his own. characters. The directors of the film carefully plot intrigues among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra. When a "character" dies, there is a real pathos. It is hard to imagine, however, that the three youths all belong to Bloque Metro, a gang that was terrorizing La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> The Sierra is not an accurate description of life in Colombia; There are of course reasons to be wary of petty crime, but when you consider pickpocketing in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not look so different after all. . Colombians are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to show the world that this once war-torn country is flourishing more than ever.
