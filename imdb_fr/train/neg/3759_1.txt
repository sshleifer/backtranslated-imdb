Oh where to start. The cinematography was great. When the film started for the first time because of the initial landscape scenes, I thought I was going for a good movie. Then, CGI Bigfoot appeared. It looked like a cartoon of King Lion and child in love with King Kong.It totally harmed the credibility of the character.Now, I knew there was no Bigfoot chasing people no apparent reason, but a caricature with cgi cheese.Thus, the whole movie was shot for me.The money they flushed to the toilet for the CGI they could spend on a suit like Roger Patterson did it. It was the best Bigfoot costume that no one could match. I am a fan of Bigfoot cinema and I was warned of this film but my impulse pushed me to watch this film and I was disappointed as previous critics had warned me. I know that after reading this review, you will always say, "I have to watch the Sasquatch hunters, I have to watch the Sasquatch hunters." Then you'll tell why I've wasted my hard-earned money in a film so terribly boring!
