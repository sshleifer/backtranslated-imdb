* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I bend over backwards to be fair to this movie. I knew it was Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in the theaters. I knew there were a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a thorough and thoughtful examination of class, culture and sexuality, as in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted about ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays a rich, pretentious and naive Gorgon who goes on vacation with her tanned husband and her casual friends (the brunette is as mean as Madonna, showing really stupid facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the role of the first companion of the ship, that the character of Madonna loves to humiliate and treat the same way the dirt in all the scenes that they have together. Why is she such a bitch to him? Simply because the plot requires it so that later, when the two of them find themselves stuck on a desert island in the Mediterranean, the tables are returned and he teaches him a lesson. Just as inexplicable is the way they fall in love although they have nothing in common and they have mistreated two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a stupid, simplistic and superficial movie from start to finish. end. Madonna gives a typical performance in wood. There are many dumb scenes: Madonna singing and dancing excruciatingly at the request of Giannini, a fantastic scene with Madonna and many scenes where he slaps her and kicks her. Guy Ritchie is doing his "stylish" editing that is laughable here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in a major film for several years. The end is pungent and improbable. This is essentially "The Blue Lagoon" and "At the Sea" merges with the nudity of the old and the sense of humor of the latter. <br /> <br /> Maybe Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself a competent actress. Please, give up, Madge, for us as for yours. This is not his worst film though. This distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She did not do anything worse than that ... for the moment.
