I * liked * the original Scary Movie. I'm a big fan of parody, it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to grasp this concept in the original film and then temporarily forgot about it. I think the Wayans are a family of comic genies. Alas, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a promise. I liked the parody "The Exorcist", especially the "come, my" gag. This is a Wayans quality material. But other than that, I can only think of two more times when I laughed: 1) When Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes sticky and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he says, "It was just a loot call!" It was pretty funny. 2) The parody "Save the Last Dance" where Cindy's character inadvertently beats a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the ephemeral laughter is no match for the laughter of the first scary movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is a pure basket full of crude and cheap gags. The jokes of the first film that were subtle or involved are magnified and exaggerated. For example, in Scary Movie I, several hints suggest that Ray's character is gay. It was hilarious. But in Scary Movie II, the whole scene of strangling the penis with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly funny. This is the model of the whole movie. Shocking humor * alone * does not take a movie very far. It was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Even if it hurts me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give it a 2 out of 10.
