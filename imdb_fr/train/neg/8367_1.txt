This piece of shit, since I can not call it a movie, can be summed up as follows: <br /> <br /> - A black criminal with a black pocket partner gets in trouble - Black's father pretends to be a baby with a face, hair and genitals of fully developed adults -Black Midget is wrong (in one way or another) by a man and a woman who want a baby -Black Midget who commits then acts of physical and sexual violence, humiliating Whites wherever he sees Honestly, it could have been a good satire if it had not been staged so superficial and if such a bastard without talent had played.
