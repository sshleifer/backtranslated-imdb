Predictable, indented and poorly written. Foolishly, I thought that such a distribution would only be involved if it had merit. I suppose that the competition between the actors is so intense nowadays (and will only get worse) that we can no longer choose one. From the beginning, we were given an idea of ​​what had been involved in the assassination, and we have stuck it in the throat ever since. The film lacked intrigue, which gave us little information about the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Part of the speech was frankly embarrassing! It is hard to believe that anyone would consider, let alone commit, to spend tens of millions of dollars on this project.
