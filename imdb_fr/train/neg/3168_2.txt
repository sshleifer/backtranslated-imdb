I had to close this table after about 15 execrable moments. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it could get better, <br /> <br /> What I saw is wrong, directed and written. <Br /> <br /> This film should never have been published directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> The main character of Hell's future bride has a huge ice sculpture on her who killed her. She was such a shocking person that I was not even sorry for her. She finds herself there in a kind of paradise, and was always repulsive, I left soon after. boring. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd, an actor who can not normally do anything wrong, was also in this adventure. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (who is no longer a teenager) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedies but NOT silly about stupid ones. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
