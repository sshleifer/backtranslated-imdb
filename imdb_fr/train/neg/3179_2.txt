I saw this film by accident yesterday in a cinema. I had some hopes for the film because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it is based. The film starts well because it seems at first to be a beautiful thriller. Quickly, the movie becomes a mess with irrelevant intrigues, characters that are never fleshed out and which no one in the audience cares about (like Marjoke) and a terrible editing. The film has far too long black fades, a flawed chronology that comes and goes and many scenes that add nothing to the story and that could easily have been abandoned. After going through history, you will find yourself facing one of the worst goals I have known for a long time. It should also be mentioned that the film contains many explicit sex scenes that you are probably used to if you watch a lot of Dutch movies. It's hard to mention good things about this movie. About a third of the viewers were already out of the cinema midway and I did not hear a kind word after the end of the film. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed all the trust I had in the Dutch film industry.
