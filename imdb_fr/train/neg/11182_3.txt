Very stupid film, filled with dumb linings and Jewish references. It was a serious movie but we could not take it seriously. A familiar movie scenario ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. An atrocious secondary plot involving Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too disciplined. I noticed that the acting abilities of Al Pacinos seem to diminish. A troubleshooter with problems, but nothing more disturbing than the terrible Atlanta Pacinos accent. Damage control must repair this damage of a film. OK, my linings are bad, but not as bad as those in this movie. This film succeeds not only in being boring but also in revolting. Usually, a revolting movie is watchable for the wrong reasons. This film is unassailable. I managed to sit through that. The plot, if it was a little better written, with, perhaps a bit better, a role and an elimination of the intrigue, and even more stupid jokes, could have released this thriller of the doldrums. What remains to us is a dull and stupid film that assured us that we thought Eli Wurman was Jewish. An embarrassment for all good Jews around the world.
