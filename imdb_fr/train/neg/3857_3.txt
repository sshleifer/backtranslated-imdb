I had hoped that this film would be slightly entertaining, like other genres of this genre. However, it was bad and I did not have much fun. Look at it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rent to lose and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been funny, maybe, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and he laughs a bit, but the film falls flat. Do not go to see this one. The staging is dull, but for what it is, directing is not so important. I guess its main drawback is that it's just not very funny. See something else, do not waste your time here.
