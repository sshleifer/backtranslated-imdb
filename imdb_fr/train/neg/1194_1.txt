I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but not as much as that. It's a movie that makes fun of big guys, has no real story, has bad actors, is not funny and much more. Is this a movie you would like to see? I suppose not! <br /> <br /> I guess the film's directors were trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was shot by a 12-year-old child with no cinematographic skills. The so-called funny parts are as fun as getting through pies in the faces or breaking the wind. Of course, if this is the kind of humor you like, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie!
