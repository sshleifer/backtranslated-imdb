I just finished watching this movie and WOW was so bad. In fact, the only thing that made me look was that it was so monumental that it was quite entertaining. The action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic way that they fall to the shots, through their incredibly bad game (were the villains all out of the street or were they really actors?), By going through a bad distribution of replicas, to their inexplicable actions (if you try to shoot someone through a door by entering, obviously, the thing to do is to shoot directly on the door handle !!). This film must break the record for the worst lines written and delivered. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera was also very painful - you can barely see what is happening in the fight scenes because of the camera's changing angle and jitteriness. <BR/> <br /> I would have voted "1" except that I like Chiba and his partner, Sue Shihomi, and two scenes entertained me: 1) breaking the arm of a villain so that the bone comes out of the skin (it must hurt) 2) a drug pawn eats an animal with brown fur (a monkey ??) by hacking the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba performs a sight operation impromptu on a guy with his fingers. <br /> <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba but this one is really not worth spending time. I have seen about 7 or 8 of his films and I have come to the conclusion that the only ones to watch (and they are great!) Are the Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I also heard that the executor and Golgo were good. I recommend sticking to those.
