At least with the teen geek getting the girl's movies, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40-year-old Virgin, he is replaced by a 40-year-old guy who is popular with women but has remained a virgin. But then you're not supposed to engage your brain with this movie or have I missed it being comatose for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of the movies in a series of 40 people acting as teenagers For some reason, this quality is attractive enough to create a serious relationship with them. I find it difficult to understand how a country that has produced such excellent television comedies seems to think that it must rely on rudimentary and superficial characters to laugh. They made disgusting movies. They acted as if all Americans had a mental age of 15 years. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This film is a rude and unfounded entertainment that has nothing to recommend.
