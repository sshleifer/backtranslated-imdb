Vincente Minelli's movies are generally worth your time; Meet me in St. Louis, the bad guy and the handsome. I waited for this film with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some have come running is scene after scene fatalism goes-nowhere. Sinatra is a sad bag, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing blur suspending him, living in disappointing nightmares as a child persuades him to finish his writing project disappointing. The film has a big dramatic ending in which a disappointing villain catches Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is supposed to be tense but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he is so distracted by pretty colors, he does not notice that the scene is a hissing shot and that the characters are drawn so thin and so undeveloped that we do not really care to be shot. (especially MacClane) But this is the only true cinematography of the project. Otherwise, we see constipated characters standing around bars and lounges and getting mad at each other for two hours. Hell IS other people, apparently. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film. The dilemma of the return of the displaced and indifference after the Second World War is treated more cleverly in "The Best Years of Our Life." And one of the two Inge products, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic" covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end city, with much more spice.
