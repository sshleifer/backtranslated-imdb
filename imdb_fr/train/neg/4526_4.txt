A foolish attempt at a Hitchcock-type thriller-mystery, an unlikely exchange of espionage against archeology and based on Robin Cook's novel; By the way, I recently acquired another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the anecdote, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) - a similar but much more captivating suspense and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a misstep from which his impressive career would not have been found. <br /> <br /> Despite its reasonably decent reach and distribution, it has proved to be a critical and commercial flop - mainly because the story is not very exciting: in fact, it is rather sullen ( weak attempts at horror - the archeological heroine who endured burial, rotting corpses, and even an attack by a burst of bats - notwithstanding). Lesley Anne-Down is the charming main lady who falls on a lost treasure. It was in fact hidden by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners who have appropriated a large part of the country's heritage (under the pretext of culture). ) for far too long. Sir John Gielgud presents himself very early as an antique dealer who treats booty and pays for this "act of treason" of his life. <br /> <br /> Generally, this happens. that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so that apparent allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are finally revealed as villains, while an ambiguous character (Frank Langella, whom I have seen in early 2007 in a West End performance of "Frost / Nixon", which has now been turned into a film) goes from the antagonist of Down to his lover and vice versa, while he decides to keep the wealth belonging to the Egyptian high priest Menephta as a national treasure.
