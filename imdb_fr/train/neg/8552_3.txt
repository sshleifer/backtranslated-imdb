... just look at the poor character of Robert Webber (again, the performance!) who tries to control a sub-machine gun of one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems to be a little fake. In my opinion, the biggest mistake is to try to give the action a solid foundation in the news of the early 1980s (fundamental difference between this film and the film much more fantastic, ironic and therefore timeless). The story presents itself as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando shouts ?? head down "all the good guys do it and all the bad guys do not do it to fly ad lib (with a good conscience), so that the main character is not broke by the gas The masked commandos, although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal, seem rather implausible and make it hard to take the film seriously, and it turns out he's trying to be more than just fun.Do not talk about the toilet-mirror-signal episode ... <br /> <br /> The criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for the evildoers does not bother me and the arguments between the fanatics of the peace and the elected ones, even directed, This political commentary is rather lame and uninspired.It is unfortunate that the film has a representation of Judy Davies at the beginning of the film.It plays the role of the main fanatic and seems to have done many studies on the subject ". Anyway, her performance is one step above the others and I feel that the film leaves it.
