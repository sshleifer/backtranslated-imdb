This is only the second time I feel obliged to comment to imdb a movie. The first time, it was probably the best movie I've ever seen, it was for Memento. <br /> <br /> See Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I have ever seen. had the misfortune to see. Aside from the two scenes containing naked women, there is nothing in this film that takes him out of the pile of garbage he is. <br /> <br /> Let's see, terrible effects, clich√© script, bad acting and about 90 minutes as long. My wife and I laughed most of the time, incredulous. Surprisingly, I watched it all the way, how did I do that, I do not know! TO AVOID!!!
