"Fungicide" is most likely the most incompetent, embarrassing and pitiful "film" I have ever seen. The acting is criminal, the direction virtually non-existent, and the special effects are likely to be combined by dropping a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenseless laptop. I really believe that things like that should not be done. I'm sure the film directors will say that, yes, the "film" was hindered by a low budget (as in nothing) - but in this case, they really should not have been disturbed. In the present state of things, they have offered the world something so terrible, so execrable, that only idiots could take advantage of it. <br /> <br /> Start the "movie", it was not like I was myself. wait for "Citizen Kane" or whatever. I was expecting a small budget horror with perhaps a minimum of inventiveness, a bit of fun and even a little energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used tissue. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, our thirsty anti-hero scientist, who works in his parents' basement, is seen moving mud. Apparently, such high-level science is the end result of years of research. His parents then send him to a strange hotel in the countryside to relax. There are other people out there who are just too terrible to write. Anyway, the scientist drops his test tube on mushrooms - and soon mushrooms grow and kill some people. (Wow, I'm starting to kill myself just by writing the plot summary). Our heroes save the day by blowing up a barrel of balsamic vinegar (by attaching a "fuse" - really a piece of string). The gun explodes without reason with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the mushrooms. The end. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as the "film" gets (and makes it really more interesting than it really is). It really should not have gone beyond this stage of development (I mean an intrigue plot scribbled on the back of an envelope with colored pencils). Someone should have really intervened and give someone a vigorous shake and say "NO". <br /> <br /> And these "special" effects. Well, they are "special", okay. It's CGI gone crazy. And done by someone who, I can only assume, believes that the bike pump is the pinnacle of modern technology. And when the mushroom-shaped monsters do not look like a set of computer software at home in 1984, they are represented by actors hanging out in a sheet (I do not bother you). <br /> <br /> about the movie is his laziness. This can be summed up in the scene in which the hero turns his guns (at Clint Eastwood) and then fails to put them in his pockets. I mean, go ahead, a few times and he could have done it, but just to leave it as it is - really weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe the money was spent on this waste. The "directors" must be ashamed and forbidden to go within fifty meters of the filming equipment. <br /> <br /> I also think that the fact that friends and family members of the director are mistaken is wrong and post false criticism and give stupidly high notes that give a totally inaccurate image of the "film" . The "fungicide" is an absolute parody of the making of a film. Mr. Wascavage is very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
