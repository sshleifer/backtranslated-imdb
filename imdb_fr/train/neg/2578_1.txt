To summarize this film: Without real plot, this film is composed of 80 minutes of disturbed characters who drink or make bad jokes. The music is just horrible, the humor is not funny and all the female characters are idiot sluts or geeks. It seems to me that the film was actually written by a 14-year-old boy, who thinks that drinking is cool, that women are designed to please men and that everything that stands in the way of this vision is a geeky. In addition, the film has nothing to do with American Pie's original films, apart from a few names, and Mr. Levenstein, who is a minor character in this one. The only good thing about this movie is the pretty girls. Do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by the rating of 5.4, as it is obviously overestimated and deserves nothing over 2.
