This clunker of a movie sets a new standard for bad cinema. Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a character very badly created in an unfortunate film, thus creating the net effect of a very bad movie. The main objective of the film is to allow a thwarted teenager to live his anguished adventure through the discovery of his mother's extramarital relationship, after a temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash. Unfortunately, this turns into a weird collage of random events (including two particularly hokey scenes featuring a fight with a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is not just sitting in a alley somewhere dreaming all this movie (and what a nightmare it is!). In addition, despite rumors of some criticism of the film's visibility, there are several scenes that are not suitable for very young children or the family, including a graphic scene of the pilot who died underwater with one of his eyes apparently bursts. <Br/> <br /> In the end, it's a terrible film that no one should be subjected to, let alone innocent children.
