A schizophrenic escaped from a psychiatric hospital in New York and teachers soon began to be fired at St. Trinity University. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the disorder of red herring. Despite running for 78 minutes, this cheap slasher hangs around again and again until the lame end where the person suspected of being the killer from the start turns out to be as such. The director Richard Haines barely pushes a sweat with a sneaky staging, but offers everything the public of the early 80s desired. For all our amateur anthropologists, this was filmed in New Yawk in the early 80s so you can experience all the culture, beliefs and practices of living people from this far-off place. The film had some merit for having offered the "Final Girl". You rarely see that. Also, always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer. Do not you trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? Fortunately, he is a false priest and he is caught. He always works from a high moral point of view.
