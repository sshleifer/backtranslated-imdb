If you are looking for eye candy, enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live artists. Visials are nice and interesting to watch throughout the movie. Now, saying this, the visuals are the ONLY thing of good in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I knew I was watching one of the worst movies of all time. I was hoping this film would be better, but it never aroused interest. After thirty minutes, the urge to go out continued to grow. Now, I own more than 2000 movies and I've probably seen that number five times. Yet this is only the second film where I wanted to go out of my life. <br /> <br /> Play - there are none. The three main artists are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the other movie I wanted to release) is just horrible in the lead role. I'd rather sit by Ben Affleck in Gigli than watch Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries So much to stay camp that she turns against her. The last article I read said that Paltrow was thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I would like to applaud this decision. <br /> <br /> History --- The serials are better written. The story of Sky Captain starts badly and worsens more and more. <br /> <br /> Achievement - none. Everything has been put into the special effects that the story, the acting and the director suffer a lot. Even "the ghost threat" had a better acting game and that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> I should give this movie a "0" on "10". Avoid paying the theater price and wait for the video to come out.
