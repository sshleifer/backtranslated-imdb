It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks acting skills, but the script is incredibly superficial and lame. You actually hear a serious dialogue that says, "I love you more". "No I do not love you anymore." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I could not take it anymore. Her "southern girl charm" just does not work and is really very boring; her attempts at funky humor fall flat and she holds lines as if she's reading the script right away. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do that, or did he wait for the promise of Papa Joe (Jessica's father and also the film's producer) to make a big deal? benefits? Let's hope he now knows better than signing another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see the painful look on his face as he suffers from the wrong dialogue. <br /> <br /> I also think that the previous comment that gave this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie one way or another or engaged by Papa Joe to give the movie a better grade. In reality, no one in his mind would find this film captivating. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe buy acting lessons?
