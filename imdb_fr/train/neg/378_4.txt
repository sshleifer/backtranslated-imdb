... but the key word here is "usually". I am known for worshiping movies that everyone thinks are stupid. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS is rated Z. Absolutely ridiculous. What I respect most of my favorite movies rated B is that they do not take themselves too seriously. Film producers like these treat the film slightly, even if it is a thorny subject. However, I have the impression that the producers of this film have seriously taken control, as if they were mounting a classic of 10 stars, with bad attempts of poignant lines and stupid camera shots. Nevertheless, despite all this, I still gave him 4 stars out of 10, because I'm in favor of movies like this one. If you are a B-rated fan, however, I would try too hard to find this one.
