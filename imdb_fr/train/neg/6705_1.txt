This film is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to be becoming a more recognized film region (such as Vancouver's ascent). The Brothers was shot in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of a failure for the region (which has made great progress with the independent film Walking Across Africa and the big HBO miniseries from Earth To The Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers. He had the potential to give a new twist to the craze of the "Boy Band". After all, N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But, the brothers probably fail because of a weak scenario. The two main characters are flat and develop almost no development (some of that could be the actors amatuer, but some of it is certainly the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> Another problem is also the choice of jokes. Many jokes are too repetitive (they come out funny the first time, but it gets a bit boring). Some scenes of "concert" are poorly organized (and many of these scenes do not seem to advance the story). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this one, but alas it's a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the next feature film based on this short film. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to switch to different genres (quickly). Comedy is not his forte. But it is undeniable that he is certainly one of the most prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (it is a shame that he is infamous, but not famous). <br /> <br />
