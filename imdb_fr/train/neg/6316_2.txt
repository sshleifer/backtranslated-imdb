A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country simply does not understand. They never did it. And liberalism continues to slide more and more into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film is about a little star in the baseball league who decides to stop playing ball to protest the existence of the nuclear weapon. It is understandable that the boy is ridiculed until a host of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, join his cause. Not only a few of them join the cause. By the time its movement reaches its peak, entire professional and university sports leagues must cancel their seasons as no one will play anymore. Just to move this review forward, I'm ready to give them that premise. Even if it would never happen in a million years, I guess that might be the case. Then from there. <br /> <br /> I do not remember very well how, but some type of agreement was made and The boy decides to return to the game he likes in an incredibly ridiculous and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the message of this film, let me just say that this film is poorly written, played and directed. Even if we agree with the boy's position, it would be impossible to overcome how well the film was built. And it's a shame because there are many good actors who are wasted. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English is doing everything he can with his character, and I hope he will try to play more movies. Alas, it is probably much easier to find work in the world of NBA coaching. We would like Mr. English to teach more to these rogue types of the NBA today how to pull the rock a little better. Alex certainly knew how to pass the ball through the hoop. <br /> <br /> Regarding the message of the film, he is stupid. Clear and simple. All these nuclear warheads hidden in missile silos in the west of the country, PREVENTED WAR !!!!! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest a real war or the use of nuclear weapons. In fact, these weapons have never been used and it is the genius of their existence. During the Cold War, neither side was crazy enough to launch a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what could have happened between the United States and the USSR. <br /> <br /> The directors of this film were obviously aiming for children in America to stand up for their cause and follow in Chuck's footsteps. In America, however, children are smarter than the kooks on the left wing who created this dreck. <br /> <br /> The film is worth only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie about the dangers of nuclear war, stick to Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
