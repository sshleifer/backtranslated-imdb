This movie was made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I am not one of them. I think he's just an imitator in the black metal movement (nonetheless, I'm not usually a fan of black metal). But as I was carrying this DVD set to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic something was, the more convincing it was. So I assumed that I was going for a roller coaster ride with rubber gore splashes and do it yourself with a sinister background. Now, that's what I like. <br /> <br /> I went home and slipped it in. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AWFUL camera work and disgusting quality. And it was then (2002), that it seemed to have been shot with a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a good evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this ... photo. <br /> <br /> After a few months, I went back (to the surroundings mentioned) and saw half. Then, not only the aspects mentioned bored me. My aversion has changed. I noticed how funny Dani was (1.65m, 5'5 "tall) in his wedge shoes tearing the head of an attacker. (Yes, ripping.) His head did not seem to have a skull. I also found that this film could have It still does not make sense I'm not done yet and so I was positive <br /> <br /> After a few more tries, I finally managed to finish this movie - a few months ago ... (Yes, it took me 5.5 years.) So - Dani was actually funny as a HELPER of Satan / Manson / super-wicked-man and the film Does not make sense See our bad person uses Dani to do bad things Why, well, I guess he's really very bad, actually they're both, and that's just about everything. <br /> <br /> We have some new news joined by the character of Dani My favorite It was about a guy who is doing someone's leg fly n, because he wants to use it as if it were his. Yes exactly. <br /> <br /> The bottom of the actor, the actor, is the worst I know. I mean, Stinger beats him (and, boy, is Stinger's CGI baaaaad) .History makes no sense. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not satisfactory. The only thing that could keep you listening is unmotivated violence and gore. Blood and guts are pretty well done. Why, you can actually see that the movie comes from there, then moved on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as he can be - and fiddles with him ... then eats what has fallen, why we never know, but we know that this cat had to be on illegal substances, his heart is almost half his size.) <br /> <br /> You might think, after my comment, that this movie is so bad that it's good, but it's bad . Fans of Cradle of Filth can add 3 points. I added one for gore.
