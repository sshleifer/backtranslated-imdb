to be honest, I did not watch all the original 'howls', but the scenes I saw clearly showed that the first howl was a good movie. so great that it took seven horrible sequels. they started with "Howling II: Your sister is a werewolf". I had this film on my uncle's VHS a while ago, when he was giving a series of old movies he had bought when Atari was brand new. I watched it last night and it was not really bad, it was just weird. I mean, the fact that Sybil Danning was three with three of her werewolf minions was totally out of place and quite disturbing (but a little exciting), Christopher Lee stabbing a dead Karen as if she were a vampire, etc. , this movie was actually a kind of mishmash of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with the werewolves, because all that Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) said about werewolves quite ripped out of all the other vampire movies (stake in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night has to die THE NIGHT, and the ruler of the werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA). not much for the acting, but the worst came from Annie McEnroe. I swear that at some point in the film, I found myself wanting the werewolves to tear their throats, because that damn throat always had to say SOMETHING. Anyway, the plot is pretty stupid and clich√©, so it's useless to tell you, you can just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, what really makes me nauseous about this movie is that it's the ONLY movie among the seven sequels that have anything to do with the original (not to mention Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so do not see this movie. there is no real horror, almost no werewolves, and just horrible special effects. 3/10
