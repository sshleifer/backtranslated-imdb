I remember that my parents did not understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15 years old. They did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I'm nearing their age, I still remember them and discover that I understand the things my kids love. But it's pathetic. I can not say that I saw it by Sarah, except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see it as something special. But this show is just so far below what I expected from her. The writing of IMDb gave the impression that it sounded like a potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off halfway. Everything else is better than that. Jokes for a 5 year old child presented as part of a supposed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is deeply moved to turn you off. I just can not believe anyone really paid for this insult to comedy. The only positive thing I can say is that there are so many bad jokes being posted here, which saves other shows of such embarrassment.
