This criticism is based on the video nicknamed Shock-o-Rama published in a world that does not deserve in 2002. How bad is it? It's awful, what a '1' on the IMDb scale is - but it's a lot worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print could make things better - the comic dubbing in English is not funny at all - but, in truth, it's one of the worst amateur movies you'll ever see likely to see. . The movie's zombies are as slow and clumsy as ever and they do not seem to have the ability to talk or think about anything but their next meal. However, they are also smart enough to use chain saws and quite mischievous to know that Western taboos on the genitals will no doubt enliven their conversation at the table. George Romero's Land of the Dead posited as a principle a zombie nation that retains some social coherence; Here, zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginations of director Andreas Schnaas. Without redeeming social value, and worse, without entertainment, Zombie 90 is a bad joke for anyone who squander money on it.
