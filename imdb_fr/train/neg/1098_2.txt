I have this film in the $ 5 box at Walmart. I would not recommend looking at this movement. I could give it to a friend of mine if I feel angry with them and want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover, went through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I would have liked to know how annoying this movie would be before shooting it. It was my mistake to think that something was going to happen in this movie. This is a group of people going from one training camp to another. The military exercises treat the soldiers very poorly and the main character tries to help people get out of the fighting in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Okay, here's my speech on this film: For me, this film is slow and difficult. watch. It was just one of those movies that you shot and you're stuck watching because you want to turn it off but you cling to a chain of hope that it might pick up in the end. It's not. Once the film was finished, I saw it behind my TV because I was furious at having lost almost 2 hours of my life watching it and 10 more minutes to write this review to warn people.
