PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> directed by: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> with: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> plot: Three years ago Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who is a bit creaky for her. Now she is getting ready for her senior prom with her stupid and boring friends. Once there, they start to die one by one because the murderer escaped from prison and nobody bothered to warn Donna because apparently his prom is too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> For: I had a lot of fun with the movie because of the horrible dialogue and stupid movements of the character. <br /> <br /> An example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man strangely obsessed with her (she does not look so awesome) s escaped from prison. Their reason: they do not want to embarrass him in front of all his friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of slasher. Usually I can have fun even with the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So, the fact that it is a slasher dubbed film PG-13 has nothing to do with the fact that I do not appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> First, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher movies that do not even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is a teacher who falls in love with her student, so he kills his entire family. A few years later, he tries to catch up by ruining his prom and killing all his friends ...? Then there were secondary intrigues that I doubt someone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps and I do not care. This should have been a feature of Lifetime, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... it's a slasher movie with terrible death scenes. I do not even care that it's not so bloody that some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not so bloody but they still had effective murders. Here we have half of the characters dying in the same hotel room, a woman who has been stabbed several times without any injury and a close-up of a bad actor's face as he screams in pain. I'm sure the 10-year-old girls were terrified, but not me. <br /> <br /> I hated the characters too. There was Bobby (Scott Porter), an unrealistic and sensitive boyfriend, and I can almost guarantee that you will never meet such a sensitive friend in your life unless you are a gay man. Then we had Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), boring friends, and the mean-spirited girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the DEATH PROOF characters were boring, try watching this movie. And do not get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me feedback on Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THIS. <br /> <br /> Add to all this predictable scenario turns soundtrack and a big disrespect for the original material, and you have quite a stench.
