I've seen a lot of badly finished films and finished in a very thoughtful way, but I do not remember a film as suicidal as this one. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly hoped that the big turn would "surprise" us all ... and it did, but maybe not in the way the directors hoped. I was surprised to find that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had something to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The film until the last thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way The story unfolded and the nature of the movie in general. But once the twist was revealed, the holes in the plot and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive of revenge was ill-conceived, and the way things were so well prepared for Bobby Earl was ridiculously ridiculous. What's worse is that once the twist has been revealed, the rest of the movie has become extremely predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a great performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in the fact that he never gives a bad performance, even if the film is not so good! So all in all, everything starts well and the process keeps the interest of the viewer. The last 30 minutes are one of the most memorable dives in the history of cinema.
