"A Damsel in Distress" is certainly not one of the best musical comedies of Fred Astaire. But even Astaire's bad movies have always had good moments. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel", Astaire is Jerry Halliday, a star of American music who is in London for a personal broadcast tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (Joan Fontaine, 19), a beautiful English heiress, who jumps in the back of a taxi to escape a crowd of admirers. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes that Alice is forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to save her from his family's mansion, but soon discovers that the house staff is betting on which Lady Alice's wife will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), the accomplice butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty houseboy, help each other turn and sabotage Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure she wins. <br /> <br /> musical has many problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the script). The story is slow, painful and nervous. When Fred does not dance, we have to endure endless scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert behaving against each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the servant are particularly irritating. These are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guy you just want to hit in your mouth. You want them to leave the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a dull woman in this film and is misinterpreted in a musical. She has little interest in her, her character, except for her beautiful face and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are in the party, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds to the plot a chemistry that is sorely lacking, and Gracie has some fun lines, but it is also sometimes very annoying. <br /> <br /> The realization of George Stevens' film is not well done. Sometimes cinematography is horrible and fuzzy. A number of outdoor scenes take place in extremely foggy streets to convince the public that we are in London and not in Hollywood. (They had to use tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin are fantastic and have become classic standards. And of course, the dance in the film is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But music and dance numbers are poorly used and poorly staged. Sometimes the actors seem to start singing and dancing, because it's time for them to sing and dance. The musical numbers seem to be inserted randomly into the sinuous plot. (At some point, the butler walks out of the mansion and launches into a solo operetta for no clear reason.) The numbers include:  "I dance and I can not be bothered now" - Fred dances well on a noisy street filled of London traffic. He makes a good "swirl of cane" with a coiled umbrella - but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps into a double-decker bus that passes by. (In Broadway's "Crazy For You" musical, Harry Groener did a much better version of this issue with a group of choir girls.) <br /> <br />  "Put me to the test "- Fred, George and Gracie make a trio of taps in an English cottage. George and Gracie go with Fred, but their numbers end badly when everyone kicks for no reason. <br /> <br />  "Stiff Upper Lip" - In a fun house amusement park, Fred, George and Gracie enjoy dancing on the spinning floor, spinning barrel and fun house mirrors. This is the best part of the film, but sometimes there is a bit of repetition. <br /> <br />  "Things are turning to the sky" - Fred and Joan Fontaine are doing their dance numbers together in the movie, prancing the woods behind the manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br />  "A foggy day in London Town" - Fred wanders by night in the fog-manor estate, humming about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London . Sometimes he feels like he does not know where he's heading in the fog - like the number of the music itself. <br /> <br />  "A great job if you can get it" - A great song that is badly used in the movie. During a social event at the mansion, Fred is coached into a chorus of hard-faced singers who sing this song at random. Every time Fred joins us, the other singers look at him as if they want him to leave. (Again, Harry Groener made a better dance number with this song in "Crazy For You".)  "Drum Dance Number" - While Fred and Joan are moving away, Fred must stop and make a last tap-tap while typing a group of drums. As usual, it's a good dance number. But it is absolutely not necessary, if not to prolong the film. <br /> <br /> The most artificial moment of the film comes from the moment Fred decides to jump from a high stone balcony of the estate to prove his love. for Joan Fontaine. As he jumps from the balcony, he finds a trapeze well placed, that is to say a * trapeze *, hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and sways to the floor. <br /> <br /> The film is worth buying on DVD for dance numbers only, but you are responsible for it. who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >> FF button lets you browse other boring scenes in the movie to access the dance numbers.
