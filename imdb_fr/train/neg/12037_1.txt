This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you understand my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood, it's amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the Robin Hood name to attract an audience. It could just as easily have been called Mr. Bland Acting's New Adventures. <br /> <br /> Someone said before me that if you had the imagination, you would love this show. It's a horrible approach to a TV show. A visual medium like this should awaken your imagination, you should not have to force it to do something to make it good. It would look like the Simpson episode, where they try to wash Homer's brain with a religious propaganda film, and he starts talking about who killed who or whoever. "If a movie is boring, I just invent my own story." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: an absolute human waste.
