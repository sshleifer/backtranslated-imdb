This story is about the romantic triangle between an nth. African prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak French and never seems to shave. <br /> <br /> As a film, it is dull, depressing and shot on a foggy background or overcast winter days or in dimly lit interiors, where everyone is bathed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was down. Everyone is pale and dejected and looks haggard, shabby and filthy. The bodies are bony and shot in such a way that they look quite ugly and unattractive. Moles, oily hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And history? Stephanie's mother is dying. The three characters return to Stephanie's home village where, through a series of flashbacks on a desolate campaign and dark interiors, we can see a little of Stephanie's childhood as a boy, Pierre. The mother dies. Well ... and that's about it. The development of the character is reduced to a minimum, as is the outcome of the story. <br /> <br /> I guess the scenario is not linear (that would explain a lot of non-sequitors) but really, after paying my seven euros, I do not want to build the film myself : that's what the director takes my money for. Expecting me to participate in the storytelling process and to get my hands dirty is almost too much to ask. <br /> <br /> This film is a pile of pretentious waste made primarily by the desire to explode the bourgeois (ie to shock the straight lines). I can see how crazy the Berlin Film Festival was and why it did not work.
