BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a frightening and useless remake of David Lean's 1945 classic, based on Noel Coward's "Still Life". A doctor removes a particle of gravel from a woman's eye in a station, he has a miserable relationship, she is a happy married social worker of Italian descent. They meet by chance on another occasion, form an instant attraction and rendezvous every Wednesday. They fall in love with each other, but after spending a few afternoons together, they realize that they have no realistic chance of experiencing happiness and agree to separate. Coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love with life. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two super stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are not what we think of "ordinary people". Loren in particular is a bad idea: Sophia Loren, well made, looking like a million dollars and working as a part-time volunteer social worker in a citizens' counseling office, does not sound right. Burton, who looks haggard, with dyed hair, too much makeup and wearing wedge shoes, does not seem to be your average GP. That said, you can not really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouse. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings writing poisonous reviews and treats her husband with utter contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, spends all day touring the house and gets bored in the end: the most exciting thing he's ever done is almost having an adventure six years ago . Their last scene together will cause nausea ("You've been far away", etc.). This great British actor, John LeMesurier, passes for a friend of three minutes as a friend of Burton and seems slightly intoxicated, pronouncing his words in a voice barely audible. It is a sad and forgotten performance in a sad and terrible reissue of a cinema classic. Avoid at all costs.
