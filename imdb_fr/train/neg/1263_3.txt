There's nothing like watching giant robots fight on a desert wasteland, and Robot Wars delivers its fruits. Of course, the acting is ugly, the dialogue is mediocre and the characters are one-dimensional, but there are giant robots! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as refined as the current standards, but they contain a minimum of computer graphics and use thumbnails, so they have aged well enough. The flaws are easily overlooked given the short duration of the film, and it has some ironic humor in some parts that make it very enjoyable. I would recommend it to all fans of giant robots or science fiction looking for an hour of light distraction.
