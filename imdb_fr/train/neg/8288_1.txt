What a pity that Alan Clarke is associated with this tripe. This does not exclude it however; Gather a group of guys and Stellas and have a good time with this one, run it over and over and roll to the ground crying with laughter. Super night stuff lost. The Al Hunter houses are on a highly publicized theme of the late 80s: the hooligans were well organized and were not really interested in football itself, with often respectable jobs (real estate agent ???). But how can Clarke convince us that any of the two-bit actors who deviate from other low-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or who go on to a poor quality drama (Eastenders) can, for nanosecond, we believe that they are a tough football rogue is laughable. Do we really have to believe that the ICF (on which the drama is based of course) would NEVER go to another city to fight with only six men? <br /> <br /> The ICF would oust subway stations, etc. Hundreds. Andy Nicholls' Scally must be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. The acting is dreadful and provides most laughs - Oldman is so camp that it's amazing. Most of them seem to be in a bath bubble of Mr. Matey. A source of inspiration for anyone who owns a digital video camera and who thinks they can make a quick move.
