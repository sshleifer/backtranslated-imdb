I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor again. She can act, but has no chance in this bait. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane of mountain landscapes. Must come from an archive archive because the movie is shot directly on videotape. The production values ​​give _Blair Witch_ a professional look. There is a truly cheesy animated statue, but no other effect to note. This movie is bad, but not fun. Players should not mention it on their resume.
