I guess "Gunslinger" was not as bad as most of the movies released by "Mystery Science Theater 3000", but Westerns are just not Roger Corman's forte. Describing Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) as a sheriff in a West West town after the murder of her husband, the film is rather predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new husband, secretly working for the unctuous Allison Hayes (yes, the 50-foot-tall woman). In addition, Dick Miller, co-star of Corman, is also a factor (he currently appears in Joe Dante's films). <br /> <br /> I want to say that you will probably want to watch the "MST3K" version to really enjoy this movie. They had a good time with that.
