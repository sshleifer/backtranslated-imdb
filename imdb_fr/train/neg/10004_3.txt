"It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​a drama of Woody Allen unacceptable." And for good reason: they are unbearable imitations of wood and pretentious Bergman. And make no mistake: the critics mostly supported Allen Bergman's claims, despite Allen's accusations. What I do not understand is this: why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman, while the current Brian DePalma was excused for "snatching" Hitchcock in his suspense movies / horror? According to Robin Wood, this is a strange form of cultural snobbery. I should agree with that.
