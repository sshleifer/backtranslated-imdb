This film was so bad that it was laughable. I could not resist watching it though. The plot is classic, the acting is quite horrible (supporting actors such as neighbor hazel and lawyer friend were better actors). It's pretty fun if you have time to spare and like to see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The headliner playing "Kathy" was just fascinating because I could not decide if her flat, flat impact was the result of a bad operation or just a bad action ( I decided it was both) This leaves the script to comment, which was rather awful. Pat's remarks, silly decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie. Maybe that's what was so fascinating. I do not know. I just watched to see how bad it could be. (In reality, the dialogue can not even be called "clich√©" - but it is almost completely stupid.) <br /> <br /> In the end, very bad film shot cheaply. The sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) have been shown time and again without any artistic talent or real connection with the action; more like accessories that were randomly left in the action in a bad game. A miner in a warehouse or in an old school could have shot at a hunting scene: mediocre shooting, inexpensive accessories, minimal action ... and I always wanted to see the end. Go understand.
