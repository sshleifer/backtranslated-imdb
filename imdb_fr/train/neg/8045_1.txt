I am so confused. What was the film about? What was the motivation of the killer? He seemed very angry, but I still do not understand why. Nothing in this film made sense. The depth was zero. Or less depth zero. Which, I suppose, would make it a hill. Or a pile. Shit. The game was horrible. When I looked for some of the actors in this film, they had very little that I had heard about, and that was absolutely no surprise. I can not decide if I should have pity on them for the embarrassment of being in such a bad movie, or feel that they should never be offered another acting job. From. . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Really, however, do not waste your time with that. There is so little substance that there is not even enough to make fun of. It was definitely one of the worst slasher movies - NO, one of ANY KIND's worst films, which I had the misfortune to watch, and I've seen quite a few.
