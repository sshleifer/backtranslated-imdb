Dear dear dear dear ... me! I had the strength to see him through ... But why ?! <br /> <br /> The first two movies were fun and pretty good. But it's so bad that we had a hard time seeing everything. It was a kind of tremor for the kids. I can not believe that this film was shot at all ... it looks like the props are from bad western series (for kids) and they just did everything they could with it. <br /> <br /> the public is this film for? I can only think 12-14 years old. If you are over 14, you will have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow, but it's so boring. The characters are exaggerated (not a bit either) and they are so stereotyped that it's fun for a while ... but not long enough to make you want to throw tomatoes on the screen. You know all that will happen too, because yes ... you've already seen BILLION billions of times in a series of heroes on children's TV. I chose all the survivors and all the quake fodder as soon as the characters were presented. It's so bad ... so bad ... so ... shit. <br /> <br /> But hey, we had fun from time to time. Not just at the holes of the idiots intrigue, but at some scenes that are worth replaying ... or at a scene: two baby tremors flinging at one of the protesters typical shaking fodder ... It's really a beautiful scene that made us replay it again and again and laugh out loud. It makes me smile when I think about it. But that unfortunately did not happen again ... and that's when the "badass" shooter presents himself and reacts marvelously well ... this and a comment: "They spring from the ground like a demon demonic! At this point, we were almost crying with laughter. But after that, nothing could ever go beyond that ... (?) ... So it's more downhill. <br /> <br /> The summits are therefore demonic and overactive trout. If someone tells you it's a good movie, it's either a "plant", a vegetable, or a very nasty one. This film must be by far the worst of earthquakes. I was looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it should be a box office success compared to that ... that ... * goose bumps * no .. I'll leave it there.
