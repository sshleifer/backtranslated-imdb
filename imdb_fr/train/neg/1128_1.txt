This film is one of the worst I have ever seen. Pure Drivel. How can someone develop a bond with the heroine or have empathy for her? That beats me. I felt that I was looking at the story of a schizoid person with borderline personality disorder. Simply terrible. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt to produce an "art" film - except that I could not find any art in my life. . <br /> <br /> If this woman had lived in today's world, she would have been taken to a psychiatric facility where she would have received antipsychotic treatment for a few days. That, or just allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman. Why the other characters in this film have found something that redeems her - and tried to help her on her quest to become an actress - speak more about their pathology than about all the convincing characteristics that made her worthy of this effort.
