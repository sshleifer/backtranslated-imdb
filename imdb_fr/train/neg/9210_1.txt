I had completely forgotten this movie until now. This was the most glaring and the worst attempt to demonize a hobby I've ever seen. Her message seemed to be: "Teenagers should not use their imagination, they could take games seriously, go crazy and hurt people." I can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this play thought that D & D style games are a form of diabolical ritual or arcane veneration.
