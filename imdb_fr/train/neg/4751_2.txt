First, when I saw Wendy Wu's trailer, I was really excited. Brenda Song, one of Disney Channel's hottest girls, practiced martial arts and it suited me ... until I saw the movie. The action was badly built, the film could not be realized, the fights were unrealistic and it was bad ... with the plot. If you really think it's a Buffy vampire mate, a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her call and wants to become queen of the house, the observer who inspires her to prepare for a great fight against an ancient evil. The idea was just not so original, the film is a waste of time.
