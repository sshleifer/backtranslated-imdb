There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this movie. Let's face it, however, the main reasons for looking at this would be: it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this movie. I do not say they are not good actors, I say they are nauseating in this film. The special effects were correct (and I would say that the filmmakers did a good job of making the boat nice to watch), but the computer has even several major flaws. For example, just before the ship passes, you can see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the story of the TRUE Titanic, but I find this film an insult to this story. The editing was atrocious - there is no reason for a movie to last more than two and a half hours (with the exception of a biographical film, perhaps), and the writing and screenplay were horribly scalded. <br /> <br /> I would say that the music was perhaps better than I had predicted (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go On"). There is a scene that jumps out at me when the ship is sinking and beating bass music. It could very well be the highlight of the movie. As for the atmosphere, it was extremely morose. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which, I know, can not be what the director had planned. <br /> <br /> In summary, I find it awful that they turned the Titanic's beautiful story into a chick movie.
