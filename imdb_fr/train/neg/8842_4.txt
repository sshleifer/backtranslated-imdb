It's pretty telling to say that most of the good reviews of the IMDb movie come from people who have only reviewed one movie during their IMDb career and, you guessed it, this movie is "Parasomnia". I have often suspected good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be anything but good movies like sneaky marketing, but it seems pretty transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that parasomnia is terrible, but it is far from the good or the big film that it has the potential to become. <br /> <br /> The advantage is that Patrick Kilpatrick is a villain who does a brilliant job in projecting threats and harm, I could easily see him having what it takes to play a really memorable villain on a equal footing with Hannibal Lecter. There are very beautiful visuals in the dream sequences. In fact, if the film had decided to explore this field further, it might have been better. The current concept of misuse of hypnosis is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although I know that the suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in a good story, it is the mark of a good story that succeeds in allowing you to do so. . If you find yourself bored by what you think is illogical or just stupid, then the story loses you and that's what happened to me with this movie. Other commentators have mentioned it here and I do not want to enter the spoiler area, but I will say that the configuration at the end was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not to mention too much the mental age of a character who is supposed to have lived a few years of life. <br /> <br /> In total, there is the germ of a good idea here in hypnotism diabolically misused, but unfortunately, this film fails to achieve it in a particular way.
