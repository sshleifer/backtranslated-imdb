If you're the kind of movie buff who loves original content and intelligent suspense ... then look elsewhere, kids, because sleepwalkers really fears. Usually, I'm more eloquent than that, but ... wow ... it was bad. I particularly like when Charles offers Tanya to take her home, she refuses, then we see her walking home. Where is his car ?? Anyway, do not see it, my friends. I really want to be more precise, but the words escape me. Cats jump on people. A guy getting stung by corn. Cheesey aligns the proverbial "wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I get that! See writer Stephen King's cameo as owner of the cemetery. He is really very good. Even with the appearances of Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But, other than that ... wow ... BAD.
