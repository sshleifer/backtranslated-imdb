This is the best way to describe this film that tells the story of a newly married couple who settles in a house haunted by the first wife of her husband, who died in mysterious circumstances. It sounds good, but it's an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the amusing aspects of this film is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises to everyone who dies of dread a free coffin. Well, believe me, no one has accepted this offer unless someone is terrified by plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and knocked doors. And the music is the worst, it consists of a constant tuba music that sounds as if played by a sixth student. And you'll discover the terrible secret so obvious that you really need to ask yourself what people thought in this movie. Someone dies running and hits his head. The police are never called to investigate. Yes, in the end, it's a slow pace (which is a shame considering the fact that the movie only lasts a little over an hour), boring little story, which is easily understood by the average person . Apparently, none of the characters in this movie was the average person.
