This film made me leave. The title was perhaps the biggest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to conquer the United States and a group of lonely survivors, regroup and plan to defeat the zombies. FALSE DEATH! He is a police officer with a weakness for killing his arrest of women who hear him when a group of zombie women come out of their graves to take revenge. As you can see, nothing concerns the nation or a county involved. Where to begin with the gravity of this film disaster has caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First, zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with a black eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies other than intelligent, questionable, intelligent and cannibal killing machines that eat according to their most basic needs? These zombie women walk like prostitutes and podium models. They speak as if they were in a bad film noir and did not behave like real zombies. Of course, eating and killing is there, but where is the imprudence and horrible disfigurement? Although this is a very interesting concept and maybe an excellent satire on the zombie genre, he makes fun of this genre and asks the question: "Why can not zombies be beautiful fox killing machines? ? " I would say that this film would be considered a very bad independent film that was produced and directed by garage addicts. I would not recommend this movie to someone who likes too many zombies, it's an insult and as scary, not even.
