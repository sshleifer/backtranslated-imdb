This movie is really awful. After seeing his ad, I thought he might have his charms ... but that's not the case. Girls can not play and they can not sing either. The soundtrack of this movie is full of their songs, and it's not nice to see, a dreadful story, an amazing plot, it's one of the worst Disney movies by FAR! Ally is not a bad actress in "Phil of the Future", so I do not know what happened in "Cow Belles". And her sister, AJ, seems to be just hanging on to the glory of her sisters, and she has no talent, anyway. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the girls end up learning some clich√©s. morality, but it's too late to save this movie from the train wreck. <br /> <br /> Awful
