OK, we all like daisies, but what's up with this distribution? Let's start with Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not a thing about this girl and Daisy was not told! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to looking like the original. Without wishing to offend Burt, I never noticed that Boss HOg was so tall. It was part of Boss Hog's humor, it was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? Okay, now, they threw Jessica Simpson, did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a T-shirt !!!!!! Cleary, these producers have not looked at the appearance of the former members of the cast. The screens were never present on the dukes !! This has made the film a stop since the beginning. I give this a huge thumb down.
