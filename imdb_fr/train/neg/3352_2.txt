I do not even know where to start on this one. "Everything revolves around the family." This must be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a "horror" movie, although it may not be a horror movie even though it has tried !!! Ugh!!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must stop playing with the symbolic guy who dies in all action movies (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man co-wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has talent. Lily Taylor should also stick to independent films. It does not belong here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no place in legitimate action for her. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.
