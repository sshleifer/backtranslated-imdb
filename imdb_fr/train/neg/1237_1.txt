I expected VERY little expectation for this so-called "reinvention" of the original - and they were not even satisfied! What were they thinking? (Answer: they have not been.) Please, do not waste your time at this garbage party in Hollywood. Cut your nails, swing your checkbook, do something other than look at it. Remember, renting things like this will only guarantee that they will do more.
