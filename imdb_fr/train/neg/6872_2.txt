This series had very good stories, but a bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. The reason why this program was canceled is obvious, even though, like most UPN programs, I did not even know it existed until it was in the form of re-readings. <br /> <br /> Most of his intrigues seemed to be copied from other shows and movies, which led me to think that producers had no original idea in mind. <br /> <br /> I did not comment enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a show of 2001. <br /> <br /> The gnome was a good character.
