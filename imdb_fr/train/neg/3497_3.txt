Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this show does not compliment her at all. The character is not even very friendly and it's not a situation where you think "oh she's so small that I love her" just "she's so amazing". This character is just a good old old me, nasty, b * tch.Sarah seems to have trouble carrying this show because she is the only one to be funny in it.The atmosphere, the dialogue is so boring and dry c Like listening to your grandfather continue to talk about the marbles he collected when he was a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman program is so boring that I was thinking of changing channels to look at something old with kids married with kids it's funny because the characters are so "immoral" and " rude. " I'm sorry, but I can not find a series full of dry, cheesy humor about the wall's stories about an angry, bitter, angry loser, loser's life with his boring sister, and his gay friends ringing like Keanu Reeves with a cold anywhere I can not stand this show, even though I usually find Sarah Silverman: "I love her because she's such an awful character", as in School Of Rock, and most some of them are standing up. I think this show is boring with characters who think to be mean and say and do things for shock value, for example. Sarah Silverman's program tries to be funny and fails. He needs a laughter track or better writers. Someone compared it to South Park but it's not even close. and will not become an annoying troll, which means you will not see me fooling around and constantly posting stuff like "This show craks" and "why it's not canceled yet". I do not do it like the Sarah program Silverman, if you like.
