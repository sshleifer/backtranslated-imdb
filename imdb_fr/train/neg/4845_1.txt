There is no artistic value in this film that deserves a prize. Well, that does not deserve a public either. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography, but frankly, the camera moves are, to say the least, disconcerting. Every image, you feel that you get a "complete image", it's as if someone "cut your eyes" edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I could not stand watching the whole movie. The worst part was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers was able to drink alcohol. These and other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice, stay away from this shit.
