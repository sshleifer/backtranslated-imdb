As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and also gore, I thought Nekeddo Burdddo sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews and even looked at some pictures to make sure the movie looked like a good gore and scary movie to watch before uploading it. So excited that she's finished and ready to be scared and back in horror at the incredible gore I was expecting I'm terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and did not even make sense and was too unexplained, the gore was hilarious rather than horrible, and what about cartoon style sound effects? The acting was probably the only slightly scary thing about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​cacti and how the mother's husband had disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light. They had left the two very unexplained, or maybe I had missed it, because my mind could not understand what I was really seeing. I appreciate the way it was meant to be; Some shocking scenes (the strange cannibalism and the fact that his mother is kissing?) Were certainly, I just think they went a little far and not even in a horrible way, they were unconvincing, which made it more credible to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. However, this is a very entertaining film that has generated a lot of laughs at home and some friends, but unfortunately we were expecting a horror and not a comedy, so it's worth to be seen as a shows for entertainment, but do not expect a dark and deep evening. scary and horrible film; you will be just disappointed. If it was a horror comedy, I would probably give it a score of nine. The height is the strange scene where the husband entered the womb and closed his wounds, but unfortunately I gave him one.
