How difficult is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Seemingly VERY difficult for writers here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I had to miss this part of the story, but in reality it did not matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and artificial; the kind of "funny concept" drug scenes far too far where any sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer tried to go "drip" at the end, which would have been appropriate if everything that led to this point was worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, big disappointment. I can see how some people might benefit from this solution, since many people will take all the garbage they have fed, but I strongly encourage them to wait for a DVD with it. Not worth the $ 23,978 to bring your family to the movies these days.
