The classic of the original exploitation, although far from pleasant at almost every level, concerns some men who turn cats into monsters eating human flesh because the cat food they prepare is made with people is redone with added scifi elements. Cats can not get enough and when the food contaminated by the flesh is exhausted, they turn to their owners. Poorly assembled at almost every level, this is an example of the absolute substance of gun material that was playing in theaters in the early 1970s and updated with breeds of cats and extra-terrestrial dogs. fighting for supremacy. The director Ted Mikel is a hack, but he is so adorable (I usually like the guy with his smile that leads to interviews and commentary tracks), which allows you to excuse just about every garbage that he has gone out. Mikels wanted to make movies and it did not matter how long they produced anything. More power for him, but I would like him not to submit to his personal films
