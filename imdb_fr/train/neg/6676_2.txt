I was perhaps not the biggest fan of Blair Witch, but I appreciated that effort nonetheless. So I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives launched in various IMDb reviews. "Unique", "intelligent", "A cult classic future" and so on ... you have to wonder where people find these kinds of things to describe such a mediocre effort. <br /> <br /> Because, alas, Altered is a poor and weak film that fails to engage in all areas. Foolishness is not funny. The horror and gore is not scary. And regardless of the "thinking" aspect that some poor people saw in this film were due to serious delusions, because there is nothing deep or intelligent about this mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so we know that nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worth it? Unfortunately no. To begin, become a very bad actor. It is no exaggeration to say that most B-series movies are characterized by a better interpretation. The parcel? Boring and messy. Dialogues? Many amateurs really do better. <br /> <br /> That's really the direction the riddle takes. I was not expecting major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small advances. Instead, our manager seems to have grown worse over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a major flaw in Altered, this is the main set. Much of the plot takes place in one place, where the main characters are confined but Sánchez did not give any personality to the place. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays a major role and is as antagonistic a character as the three students, one would think that the director would realize that the same thing was needed here. But no ... this place has no personality, thanks to sloppy management and no attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing recoverable here. The hardcore fans of "Blair Witch" will follow Daniel Myrick better. Although his production is far from perfect, it has a better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories, but still).
