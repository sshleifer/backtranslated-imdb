As a former teacher (!), I must confess that I immersed myself in many scenes, although I continued to watch until the end. I wonder why?! (Boredom, maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> The first scenes of opening seemed incredibly cold and confused. The plot too, although there are some good ideas - the fate of a rescue teacher, for example - was not focused enough in one direction to allow 3D development. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Mr. Nolte's best choices. moments. With regard to the young M. Macchio, does he speak thus in * each * film? <br /> <br /> In addition to complaints about acting, the hairstyles alone were a nostalgic (if nauseating) trip. <br />
