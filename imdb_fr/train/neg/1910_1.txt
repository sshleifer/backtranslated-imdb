I tried to watch this so-called comedy, but it's very difficult to bear. It's a bad film, narrow-minded, clich√©s. Certainly not funny, but very boring and annoying, indeed. Wrong scenario, bad acting. It's a total waste of time - and there's nothing left to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 point out of 10.
