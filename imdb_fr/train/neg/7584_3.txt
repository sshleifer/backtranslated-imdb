I recently attended the rebirth of "Blithe Spirit" on Broadway with Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. It's a fantastic production and shows what good actors can do with a piece that is not perfect. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> It was probably a mistake to watch the film version of the play starring Rex Harrison. The film does not have the energy or laughter of a good theatrical production. <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those pieces that works best with a live cast, in front of a public just laugh. Actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their interpretation and delivery of lines, and involve the audience on a personal level that you can not get in a movie theater or with a DVD projection, where the audience is separated from the story of the "fourth wall". The story: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison), successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a house in the English countryside. Seeking information for her forthcoming book, a book about the supernatural, Charles invites Mrs. Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, resuming her role in London's original production of 1941), a local spiritual medium, at home to conduct a session. Charles believes that spiritualism is a sham, but hopes to take "the tricks of the trade". But then, Mrs. Arcati brings back the ghost of Elvira (Kaye Hammond), the first wife of Charles, died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops a raging rivalry with Ruth over Charles (complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> On stage, actors can give performances that invite to laugh situation. But on the screen, the actors of "Blithe Spirit" tear the lines as if they did not know that someone listened to them. They mumble lines that have been designed to make people laugh on stage. The performances of Harrison, Cummings and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless. Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> The visual effects of the Oscar-winning film are not impressive - not only by today's standards, but by the standards of 1946! It's mostly about Kaye Hammond, who walks around dressed in fluorescent green makeup and puts on her makeup, being photographed with special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost. <br /> <br /> The director of photography deserves credit for creative lighting. But compare the dull visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" to the truly revolutionary effects of Disney's "Song of the South," eligible for rewards the same year. In "South", humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly, minute by minute. Compared to "South", the Oscar that "Blithe Spirit" had received for special effects was completely undeserved. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can only encourage you to watch the resumption of this game with Angela Lansbury before it closes. Regarding the film with Rex Harrison, skip it.
