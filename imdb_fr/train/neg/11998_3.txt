it's a terrible movie, terrible !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> first TOOO long. the longest film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> the stories are all too cursed !!!! <br /> <br /> In fact there are too many stories for the story line to be ruined. <br /> <br /> The comedy was not a comedy !!!!! it was not funny at all .... <br /> <br /> The story is so repulsive and badly written that the fact that the characters live or die does not matter ....... < br /> <br /> I had some expectations of this movie ......... but my expectations were completely crushed in the first minutes ...... <br /> <br /> the only good thing about this movie is the music ...... and of course Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and stands out among all the main actors ...... she is just a newcomer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the blonde who plays her love interest also help to save this disastrous film. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of the taxi driver. and the Blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> Another talented actress, Ayesha Takiya, is completely lost in this movie !!!! so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay is doing his part well but he seemed too exaggerated !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally lost ...... <br /> <br /> the only one who is not lost is Salman, because he has no talent, so he must be wasted !!!!!! !!! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very impossible film with a meticulous scenario and TOOO Masladar that the screenplay is shaped according to stupid comedy scenes. imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 it lasts four hours !!!! Think and think again before going to the cinema !!!!! Better to avoid it !!!!!
