Well, I'm blown away, a Woody Allen movie that I went out after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a movie I saw less than half, but I hope you'll understand Why). Basically, it appeared very early that we would receive from the screen of the screen with: a script that states its concept as if it had bullet points; a cast that all tried to be characters of Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloé Sévigny), and were poorly directed to do so; and a camera that stood dangerously around, just so there was nothing to film but to chat and the actor who delivers it. Drama? No; it is partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to create a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I left too early in this affair, but then I decided not to take an extra hour and a half -liner-Allen clones. The script has its funny moments ?? I went almost entirely to the back of Will Ferrell's snippets in the caravan (this caravan is hung again, doh!) ?? but there is little time to let them fly nonchalantly, as it should. Worse than that there is no fluidity. To say that the wood of this film makes a forest look like a forest: the opening discussion related to a coffee is the most abject case. The only thing that should be done by numbers is being reviewed ?? 2/10.
