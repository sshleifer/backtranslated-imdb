The second attempt of a "Swedish" film by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years - the first being "Brother Carl" Susan Sontag (which was shot in Sweden with Swedish actors, no less!). The results? Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop": "It would take a heart of stone not to burst out laughing at the death of Little Nell." About the same thing here. "Interiors" is filled with solemnly sung howlers. ("I'm scared of my anger." Looking into the middle distance: "I do not care who I am.") Bergman's (to use a polite term) directors quotes are close to parody. The incredibly independent family remembers their talent and talent, to the point of being strangled. ("I read one of your poems the other day, it was - I do not know - the New Yorker." "Oh, it was an old poem, I reworked it.") Far from do not worry about these people, However, I found them quite hilarious. Most of the dialogues are similar to the amusing things in Allen's previous films: he is the only one to have asked his actors to play the roles in a straight line. Not finding herself in the film, poor Mary Beth Hurt will copy all her twitches, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate mother (much like Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> The basic scenario - a dysfunctional family with a quietly dominating mother - seems to be more or less taken from Bergman's "Winter Light", the basic melodrama of the rigged family with a lot of anguish. existential. Everything happens in the visual and sound tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on the paper, the imposing surf that surpasses the walkers on the beach. etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Allen's "serious" movies are less annoying but far less entertaining. I will take "Interiors". Woody's rarely made a funny movie.
