... was so that I could, in all conscience, tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I had barely spent twenty minutes before starting to think in myself: "Wow, it's really not so good." And, to be honest, I would have given this 1-star movie if there was not Esai Morales (although he had very little time on the screen). It's the only well-played part of the film, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought so. <br /> <br /> Looking at this, I started to rethink his role in "Shawshank Redemption" and realized it was not as good as I thought. Problem: his role in the prison / the hard seems to be an act; his dialogue sounded as if he was making a very bad impression. Has he ever met anyone who speaks as if his character was SUPPOSED? I doubt it, but he should have done it. <br /> <br /> And, to make matters worse, they managed to apply a little prison philosophy and give the impression that nothing seems artificial, especially considering that the rhetoric was spouted by a "rasta" whose accent was so strong that it seemed abnormal. <br /> <br /> I would not normally snap a movie like this, but when I live it, favorable review. I felt cheated and lied, and I thought I should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
