Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of Troma's muddy mud. It's a juvenile, careless and stupid, low-budget horror movie about teenage girls spending the weekend in a mansion. "Nightmare Weekend" is a trash can full of nudity and a little cheese gore, not to mention a laughable musical score. is horrible and the script is totally inconsistent.Why this kind of shit is widely distributed is beyond me.Avoid as plague.1 out of 10.
