As other reviews show, this movie could scare you when you're a little kid. (And that's probably all it's good for.) <br /> <br /> However, if you're older, this movie does one thing: suck most - and therefore, I do not speak no game soundtrack, cut or sth like that. I'm just talking about "intrigue" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I do not want to give more than spoilers than necessary (if after reading this, you still want to watch this movie), but if you are graduating from any school, this is just a big insult to your intelligence. Looking at it, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was VERY stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - the formation of UNITE (an evil organization of the United Nations - association) <br /> <br /> -> we are supposed to believe that it's evil. is it even bad at all? if so: why is it evil? <br /> <br /> - the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> it is not necessary to impose it on the people, so why on earth (without a game of words) do they do it? <br /> <br /> -inviting Christ in your heart just like a lip service <br /> <br /> -> because there is nothing else, which in this movie is considered " a true Christian, "never do it, except by saying this stupid prayer. so ... just say this prayer before the rapture and you're saved - whatever happens ?! <br /> <br /> Thus, note 1/10
