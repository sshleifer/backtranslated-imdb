Rather than long dance sequences and close-ups of the characters who dragged the film - the film would have been better served to explain the characters' story and motivations. <br /> <br /> The marginalization of Nubo, the minister, my aunt, my mother - and the abandonment of the dynamic and important rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri have made the film really lacking depth. If you had not read the book, you would not really understand why Sayuri loved the president and why Mameha became his mentor. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film was sensational - and the actors all did their best with the film. The scenario was given, but that's all that was good in this movie.
