Dreyfuss plays a gang leader who has lost his mind, but now he is "repaired". Lane is his daughter having fun with his number one (Goldblum), who is supposed to have something to do with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what everyone could consider as an all-star support cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance of Richard Pryor) can not help but participate in this plot, Dreyfuss proving that he is not "repaired" and trying to kill just about everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know It's not like you do not know what's coming. The first ten minutes were just guys trying to tell Goldblum what was waiting for him when Dreyfuss was out, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason I chose this movie is because I've been on Diane Lane's kick lately and I'm trying to see all her movies. The real disappointment for me was not only the appalling plot, but also the fact that it does not show up until the last fifteen minutes of the film (although we hear about it throughout the film). Even being a fan of more than half of the cast can not help me enjoy this movie. The games where the suspense was supposed to go up made me laugh at what was really going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
