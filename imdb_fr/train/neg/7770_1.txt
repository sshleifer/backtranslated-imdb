This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. While I was touching the end of The Cold, I came to the conclusion incredible that this movie was actually even worse than this 60th. The story ?? as it is ?? It's about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people in their remote home to play a series of macabre games. Anyone who manages to keep pace and survive to the end will earn $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple plot but Rebane still manages to make the procedure almost incomprehensible. Things happen. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Strangely. I mean, what was it that ended exactly? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions. Production and play values ​​are unquestionably a pornographic film standard. In truth, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even so good. She is unbelievably terrible, she is convincing. Unfortunately, we can not say the same thing about this crappy party as a whole, it's just a good deal for a basement.
