It may be one of the worst movies ever to be in production. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning, where the guy walks ... and walks ... and walks (spoiler). There is a 15 minute walk. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention the lighting problems, it's as if they were filming even night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The acting game was terrible. Looks like they found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took the people who were turned back. <br /> <br /> Please, for the sake of all that is holy, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. The director should be liable to prosecution by the war crimes court for passing the message to the public.
