I never really liked the film Myra, although I appreciate how he pushed the limits of Hollywood at the time. Miss Welch's costume has certainly become an iconic image, although I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image have actually seen the film and know what it is - <br /> <br /> J I saw Myra on FMC a few years later and did not think he had aged better over the years. There is a segment about it in the Cartoon Cartoon Sex History comics, where it is widely acknowledged that it has allowed such big stars to play in a then outrageous production. However, in my humble opinion, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too silly to be an actor, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage OR entertain ---
