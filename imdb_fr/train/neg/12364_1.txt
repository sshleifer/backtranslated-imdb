My God, I'm so sick of shit coming out of America and it's called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> Since the anime has become popular, American animators produce either a cartoon with a 5-year-old lazy donkey. drawing style (Kappa Mikey) or a good Japanese animation scam. (Typically, we are kidding classic characters) No wonder the anime beats American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They do not even try anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about that last night; I live in the UK and when I learned that this program was first launched in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was as up-to-date with current shows.
