I do not think I'm too far from the base saying it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen. I worked on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day", "To Hell and Back", "Bridge on the River Kwai" (in black and white), all of which have good plotlines, characters rich and super actor. I saw better dialogues and play in high school play pieces written by students. The plot, however, is not a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's a bit like a car accident, however, I could not turn it off! A movie does not need a lot of money or great scenery, like "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... the budget is not an excuse. What were they thinking?
