A young American woman visits her Irish roots and drives away a druid witch who wants to own her. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where he was going. The film seems to hesitate in two directions: are we watching the story of the American-Irish woman fighting against her drinking problem or are we watching a horror movie about an evil witch coming back from the past? The director can not decide. Both do not seem to gel and in the end, you are not going anywhere. It could be so much better and the story seemed to be dragging on towards the end. It was very boring and disappointing.
