I saw him, I agree with him 100%, but I did not care about his delivery. He has just come out as a jerk in a poorly edited and poorly designed juvenile smear campaign. Edit cuts galore, etc ... The camera would focus on him and you would see two or three mounting cuts on a minute or two of dialogue. Add to that microphones booming in shooting, which is a no-no movie. <br /> <br /> This documentary addresses a subject with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the film is made so easily. . Picking religious fanatics is like attacking a retarded child. It's so easy that it's just wrong. I mean how difficult is it to make these people look like nut bags? To force them to contradict each other, it is enough to let them recite more than one verse or two. I like when he jumped back between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting each other. <br /> <br /> I just think he could have done something a little more creative. The part where the neurologist talked about brain activity was never expanded. It could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious crises in relation to drugs, sex or ???? He could have played more on all the women enjoying the Passion piece that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gone into the story of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had a pretty colorful past. Immerse yourself in science v. religion. One is a very methodical and very strict process to increase confidence in theories. It is built from a solid base, a new layer over a more proven layer. A huge burden of proof is required at every stage of the process. The other begins at the top and ends with indisputable claims. That's true, because good ?? I said it. <br /> <br /> Well done ?? I would say make an original HBO series? strike a different religion every week. <br /> <br /> It opened your eyes to one thing. I had to be blind. Good old G.W.Bush ... no wonder he was elected. He had the religious majority. Well ... now it's the blind man leading the blind man. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer .. Well .. what can I expect from a guy who goes to Sutra in Newport Beach?
