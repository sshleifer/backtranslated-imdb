When we were in high school, some of us, boys, sometimes triggered nauseating bombs. It was considered funny then. But the producers, directors, and actors of "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they DECALATE them all the time. <br /> <br /> Like the previous comment that wondered if the cast was eager to get off the set and go home, I doubt that more than one shot was made for any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, very hot in "Mighty Aphrodite" and other classified films, seems to have under-sold this project. Her game is non-existent and is mainly limited to melancholy looks that are meant to indicate how sensitive she is to the fate of the various victims of the film. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - do not be the next victim! Stay away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. There are not many good shots in Mira's legs (the only strengths I can find in the movie) and the secondary cast is of inferior quality, delivering a mishmash of poorly done dialogues with "spanish" accents "embarrassing worthy of the best high school theatrical production.
