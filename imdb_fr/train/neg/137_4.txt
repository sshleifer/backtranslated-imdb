It's easy to understand why the creators of Scary Movie found it so easy to parody these "teen slasher" movies. They are incredibly formulated. And if Valentine had been released about a year ago, I'm sure they would have also imitated this film - that is, if they found original material that would distinguish it from Scream, I know what you have did last summer and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new to this kind of music, except for a better ending than usual which of course leaves plenty of room for the inevitable result. As always, a masked psychotic killer watches a group of pretty young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, in a typically excessive style. A lot of T & A on the bill, no character development, bad acting and too much bloodshed. <br /> <br /> The thing I can not stand about this kind of movies is that they pretend to be "who did that?" . The problem is that they are not because the motive is revealed only when the murderer has unmasked and tells the main character that his friends have now all been murdered. Anyway, something that was never clarified during the movie (for example, the uncle's fishing partner of the main character's mother kicked the dog of his friend's father). Everyone who stays alive throughout the movie is a "suspect", but they are more "Red Herrings" than suspects. As we all know at this point, the main character succeeds in an unlikely escape and kills the unmasked psychopathic killer after the revelation of the motive. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************SPOILER!!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway) *************** In Valentine, the pattern was not revealed, but there was more left for you to think about, since the film was not has not ended well yet. teen slash 'way. The problem is only partially solved and the goal of the lead killer can be achieved or not by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everyone. Will the killer want more, or are the demons really defeated? <br /> <br /> It still has not made Valentine a good movie, but it just kept it from being as bad as ever, which still does not matter. To anyone thinking of making another film in this way, please do not do it. Originality is so important and it is difficult to distinguish any originality of this kind.
