This film begins in a promising way, with an early scene in which Frank Morgan recommends avoiding the wedding of Gary Cooper with his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing the role of an unscrupulous gold digger, complains loudly to Cooper about his perceived shortage from his family, including his daughter, Anita Louise. I am a fan of the 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (to me) a treasure in Hollywood, Cooper a legend and Louise a very beautiful actress, versatile and underrated, rarely seen in the lead role. In addition, I have nothing against Teresa Wright and, even if she does not have a great autonomy, it usually offers performance that is warm to the heart. <br /> <br /> The year opens with a promising story that slips to the end. I could not find anything to burn the house of Cooper's future in-laws. The butler of a household as tedious and non-smoker would never go away cheerfully, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or he would certainly provide a way to get rid of his untimely cigarette. Moreover, nobody of common sense would allow himself to hold a lighted cigarette without asking for a way to get rid of it. And finally, nobody who fears nothing crushes a cigarette in a handkerchief and puts it in his pocket! This whole sequence has just made Cooper look stupid and awkward. It's a poor device - poorly designed and filmed so as to ridicule and not make people laugh. <br /> <br /> The Forced Medical Examination of Cooper is also designed. No one is allowed to undergo a complete medical examination without having informed him of his purpose or his consent! This Cooper is too far from reality to be funny - it's absurd! Stealing babies in hospitals is a serious offense and there is nothing to laugh about. Finally, Cooper's overly tedious neurotic attention to his baby's diet and weight may have touched a nerve with some people who have experienced the anxiety of their own newborn baby. But for me, they just seem tedious and slow. Wardrobe and accessory services have been in the lead in these scenes, while, paradoxically, the screenwriter has fallen asleep. <br /> <br /> The lines are just not in the script to generate humor. They simply miss all the cylinders. Bursts of laughter do not come by the minute, but rather by a light year. The only time the movie has energy or humor is when Frank Morgan walks past the camera. <br /> <br /> The scene is totally ruined when Cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are locked up in the same hotel. room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in this mine, but none of it has been extracted. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the two very nice girls is going to hurt herself. As you might expect, it's the character of Anita Louise, who is dumped on her wedding night! Even if it's not on camera, it's his destiny, and it's not particularly funny, even as a weak point. She did not do anything in this movie to make me unfriendly (unlike Gail Patrick, for example, in My Favorite Wife). Therefore, I was expecting (maybe "hoping" is there a better word in the context of the movie!) So that Anita Louise also knows a happy ending. The fact that such a nice character is practically wiped out at the end of the film really undermines the "happy ending" effect for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen, for a witty dialogue. so typical of the movies of the time ... and this was never delivered. A good performance of Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally ruined here.
