It was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and a dreadful acting game !! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids. The film seemed to be a very long advertisement for Jessica Simpson's bright red lipstick - especially since there were so many close-ups on her face. The premise was not fun and as I said - soooooooo predictable. All the money spent on making this film was a shameful waste. Any reference to other old Marilyn Monroe films did not improve Blonde Ambition's vision at all. It was amazing that Jessica Simpson could take a position as executive secretary in no time - it was laughable !!!
