It's a Japanese movie, but English is also spoken here. It's a nice movie, with beautiful visuals, featuring the picturesque beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, it was the only quality that bought me back. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman sulk 90% of the film because her husband "photo" is much older than he had announced? Granted, this could be a disappointment ...... but get over it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes, she has flip-flopped and likes it. At that time, for most viewers, it was too little, too late. We had fallen asleep by then.
