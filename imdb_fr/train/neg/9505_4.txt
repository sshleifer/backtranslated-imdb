I will not criticize the film. There is not much to say. There are good animal action scenes that were probably quite amazing at the time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly an idol in the morning. It is a little light and not particularly beautiful. But it is okay. He is the man in this lion cage. We know that if he can not take the time needed for his lions to take care of his girlfriend, he will end up on an island with her and will have to save the situation. Someone said earlier that it was a history lesson. The circus scenes are from another day, especially the children who hang around. I did not know that even in the thirties, they had sailed on three mast schooners. It looked like something from 1860. I guess it's the footage footage they had. No wonder the thing broke. They always talk about fixing it. There is even an airship. This tells us a bit about the relationship between men and women at the time, a kind of gigantic stupidity. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
