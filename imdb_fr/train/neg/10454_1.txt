when discussing a film titled "Snakes in an Airplane", it should be noted early on that snakes are very important to the plot. <br /> <br /> Here we have very bad CGI snakes that do not look or move like real snakes. snakes are scary because they look slimy, they crawl, they slide. these snakes do nothing of the sort. they slide like in a video game. they are cartoon snakes. I would even go so far as to say that even a person who suffered from a major phobia against real snakes would not find those who feared <br /> <br /> why would you then want to include extremely close shots of these failures? cgi? why not rely on suspense ... all the "less is more" ethical. or better yet, why not just give them a nice appearance? and then maybe even use them sparingly. <br /> <br /> take a look at John Carpenters carpentry. here we have real mud and a gore of disturbing proportions. 20 years have passed and we have this pile of shit sfx stinky "snakes in an airplane". When will these people wake up and smell coffee? special effects go back! <br /> <br /> you can say ... but the movie is a joke, do you have it? of course, I'm with this idea, but do it well! in addition to the above, this movie has a crap dialogue. and the music and sound effects are neither scary nor memorable. <br /> <br /> I could handle all the other actors in this movie except Jackson. what was he doing there? the man who played in pulp fiction 10 years ago. is this career progression? do you treat people good value for money? no. I would like to know what Tarantino was thinking about halfway through this fucking film <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to offer them exactly what they want. Coming out of the cinema, I saw a number of commercials for really horrible upcoming releases, including ... DOA: dead or alive, (another) CGI animated movie titled "Flushed Away", and another comedy in search of shit named "click". on top of that, I saw terrible trailers, including one for British horror / comedy. I really have not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time <br /> <br /> Expect to see this movie for sale in the bargain section of the Â£ 1 DVD in 6 months. and if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of awesome snakes and some cool and cool dialogues from samuel l jackons lips. forget it.
