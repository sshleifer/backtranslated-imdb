Stupid show quite predictable on a man who killed his wife by shaving the wheel saying he had fainted. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car after killing his wife with one? This question was not asked of writers. The story then goes on about a psychologist and her failed marriage, which is linked to the failed marriage of the driver of the mother-car killing his wife. An omniscient mother and a one-dimensional child are projected for good measure, and all is built as a predictable outcome and a smashing finale. Are police psychologists so easily assimilated? Fatal writing with which the actors do their best, but they are doomed to fail. It's on a par with a harlequin novel. Do not waste your time looking at this one unless it's what you're aiming for.
