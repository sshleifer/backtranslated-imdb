First, there are some good things about this movie, but these are slasher clich√©s combined with a teen movie. In the commercial of this film, which I saw, Denise Richards was very present, but she is a poor actress and is not as beautiful as people try to pretend to be her. it has nothing to do with the movie). And what is this look she gives to everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but as I said, the acting ... Still, the writing is fine. You know who is throughout the movie and you can almost predict what will happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book he's based on is probably good, judging by the plot plot, but next time I'll read it to find out rather than look at it.
