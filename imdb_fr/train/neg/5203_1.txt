I have seen bad movies in my time, but it really takes the cookie! Why oh why was this movie made? There is nothing here. Please trust me, flip the switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera. This is the key problem, the story "based on a true story" (mmm ... it does not matter) does not lend itself in any way to a maturation of 80 minutes. So we have to sit for over an hour watching people walk around. That's it! In the whole first half-hour, nothing happens, apart from watching someone walk to a store ... then three men walking in a wood. This time could perhaps have been devoted to the development of character ... but no. And so, there is absolutely no connection with the people on the screen, so when they start shooting, we do not care about it! In fact, I finally vouched for the villain for the film to end! On top of that, the work of the camera is really horrible! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West, is nil. I hate to hit a guy, but really, his job is pants! These boring close-ups continually, then a long single, follow the people who walk - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I just wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists! How this man was led to direct the next film on the fever of the cabin, it exceeds me! Finally, the acting is also sad, ... which is true for the film as a whole. Preserve your mental health, stay away from this pile of total excrement!
