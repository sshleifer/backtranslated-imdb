Oh, brother. The only reason that this very irritating film avoids receiving the total "bomb" of me is because it is at least historically remarkable as the first film of the Three Stooges (when they were not yet alone and that they were still struggling with this painfully unusual Ted Healy). But even as a long-time Stooges fan, I must say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are misused here as three zany auxiliary concierges of Mr. Healy's greatest concierge. They are not regularly featured in the film and their idiotic passages describe them more as zany and hyperactive cartoon characters trying too much to be fun. <br /> <br /> Most of these toothaches are about Jack. Pearl trying in vain to make the audience laugh like a man who poses as Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of the level of humor: "I oppose!" "For what reasons?" "Ground coffee ! "). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even schnoz itself is boring.
