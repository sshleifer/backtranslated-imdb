Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. There we go. Now we know that this movie is going to be really horrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But even I did not think it would be bad. The plot is terrible, Van Damme is aging (well), but unlike Arnold, his films are too. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. Do not see it. Already. I would not even get paid to see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - at its heart is a magnificent thrill ride. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but marketers would like us to think so, right? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
