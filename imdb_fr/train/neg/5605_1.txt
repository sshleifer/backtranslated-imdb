I was very disappointed with this movie. I was expecting more police detective film with Thelma and Louise. Instead, the women escaped from prison in this movie had no sense of loyalty to each other. These were an extremely vulgar group of hyenas who beat, doubled, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> To plan their escape and find the hidden cash reserve, the escaped women were too selfish and vicious to trust each other. These women were not liberated in a positive way. They just ended up being a group of lost cannons, unable to respect themselves or each other. If you like crime movies from the '70s, skip this bomb and discover The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, starring Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
