I saw this movie when it came out in the 1970s and I hated, hated, hated! Without a doubt the most interesting movie I have ever seen in my life. I do not know where Leigh's inspiration comes from, but it's one of those movies in which you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no save moments in this film, but long, long silences with people unable to express what they (suppose) feel. If you want to look at something that will make you drink, it's the one that suits you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, put a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything you'll get! Yes, Leigh has proposed a lot of really useful things much later in his career, but do not miss this one.
