In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as "the horror film of a thinking man". Wow, could you say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It features a young actress who has a range of 1 to 2 years. G. Headley with a bad British accent (doubled) and a story without thrills, thrills or rollovers. <br /> not even interesting psycho-babble. We only laugh at its inexpensive effects and look forward to a performance of Leprechaun 5. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams . What you get is not a good horror, nor an art house, nor even a decent special after school. I found myself after the two o'clock point saying ... where my two hours passed. <br /> <br /> The direction is not inspired and I wish it could even be pretentious ... something interesting..it seems that the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the world of dreams, things are boring. <br /> <br /> A short not on this one.
