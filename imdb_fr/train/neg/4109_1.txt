Can only be described as awful. It is bad to start and gets even worse. When you start, you really have to look through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but do not be afraid, because it happens. Another poorly written script for a donkey-maker for an offspring without the talent of former movie stars. It is difficult to decide if the scenario is worse than the acting or if the staging is worse than both. As for the hero, well, he's telling everyone, including a scene in which he silences the light of day by opening the door of the closet and smashing it against the window. And in another scene, he is thrown through a window and collapses on the concrete at 20 feet - does not even blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck in the bad guys. It's a really ridiculous film. Fortunately, it only cost me $ 1 to hire.
