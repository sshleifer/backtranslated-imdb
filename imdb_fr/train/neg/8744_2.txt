I sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure whether to regret it or not. I had the impression to watch the film directed by this group of film school students who did not quite succeed. He embodies all imaginable Hollywood clich√©s, while flogging us with the message "Societies are the ultimate evil". The subtlety this movie does not know. As for that, he even manages to supply his own spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be the imaginary world of a computer nerd become reality. The main character is a seductive teen with a girlfriend, but he's a programming genius and an apparent hacker (I think), among many other nerd-fantasy-become-real elements you'll have to see through yourself. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I should have known that it would be a movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be good advice. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend it. one, I'm scared.
