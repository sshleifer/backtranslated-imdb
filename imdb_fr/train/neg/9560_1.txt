Thank God I looked at a friend's house and did not pay for it. The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show. If you have knowledge of computers or electronics, be careful. You will feel as if the film was an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> In addition, the actress turned into a lot of music, VJ Amanda Walsh, displays the worst acting I've ever seen, excluding porn. She is lucky that Matt Lanter is decent. He is the one carrying the film. <br /> <br /> I hate to lose almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a shame they could call it a sequel, because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
