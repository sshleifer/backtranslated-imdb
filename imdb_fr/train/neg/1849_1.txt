I was interested to see the movement thinking that it could be a rough diamond, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible staging (the filming sequences do not flow) even though the director might say that's what it looks like it's very simple and immature) editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs and the stock was a low budget video. I would say it was not even as simple as the mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are simple ways to repair a film with what the director did, for example through editing, etc. But obviously he does not care. This film requires as much effort as a ham sandwich. This could be improved, but it would involve extra work.
