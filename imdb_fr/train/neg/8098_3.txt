This is one of the most horrific rewrites I have ever seen. If they want to make a movie with an ugly story, they should refrain from giving it the title of a good book. There is hardly any relationship between Wolfe's book and this film other than the title. The changes do not bother me if they allow a story to go on screen. At least the changes should not hurt the end product. The last scene of the film is extremely unconvincing. The actors are poorly informed. The director and / or scriptwriter obviously could not decide to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you saw this movie and did not like it, try the book. If you saw this movie and liked it, read the book.
