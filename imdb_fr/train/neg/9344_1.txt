As others have pointed out, this movie is a pretentious motivational charge for the blind or the masochist. <br /> <br /> We all know, after seeing art galleries and acid house, that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humor or realism, movies like this one do not work. And even more important without a decent storyline, a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring, or provoking reflection on the screenplay of this movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won two Bafta Damage shows that the UK film industry is at the moment. I thought the Australian film industry was pretty bad at the moment, but unfortunately the UK industry was even worse. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that I would not even bother to rent it at the weekly section. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give a large place to this film.
