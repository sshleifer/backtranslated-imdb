there was truth in this film. I remember a story that was told 15 or 20 years ago that four fishermen found a body in the water and they chose not to report it until the end of their trip. I also remember that they were accused of interfering with a corpse (or something like that). I do not know if it was in Australia. Viewers living outside of Australia must think that we live in a country populated by rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan. But to be one of the best Australian films of all time, as someone has claimed, I can not be so generous. Said this way, I would not bother to look at it.
