It's a 30-minute show on a joke. The joke, Cavemen are not treated fairly. Hahaha !!! He can not call a phone because he is a caveman. Cavemen are not as intelligent as humans. Oh my God, these Cavemen are so simple. There is no humor in this show. They can not escape this joke for a long time and they already have it with Geico commercials. This show does not deserve a slot on T.V. <br /> <br /> This show strives to be funny, but that's just not the case. Watching this show, I thought it was trying to look like a "Bachelor Gone Wild Show". Which means they go to the bar and try to sleep with a lot of women. The caveman who cries is annoying. The caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I do not understand why I do not like them.
