In addition to the slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s, the undead movies were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre. While the slasher movies had "Black Christmas" and "Halloween" for all to go well, the zombie movies contained George Romero's "Dead" movies. And not surprisingly, shortly after the success of his first two titles, other directors wanted to cash. Many Italian filmmakers were particularly interested, like Lucio Fulci, who brought us "Zombie" a year after Romero's "Dawn of the Dead", known as "Zombi" in Italy and other countries. is where Fulci's movie was known as 'Zombi 2'. Apart from the undead, it has nothing to do with Romero's film, but is a good movie in its own right. It was a big success in Europe and 9 years later, a sequel was born. <br /> <br /> Pros: Many beautiful lush landscapes. Impressive score. The acting is not really good, but casting is a game and seems to enjoy the experience. After a kind of slow start, the pace advances like an action movie. A lot of cheese and involuntary hilarity for bad moviegoers. Good job on makeup effects. Lots of blood and a little decent gore. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: practically plot less. Nothing you have seen before. It blatantly removes elements of the first two films of "Return of the Living Dead". Cardboard characters. Did not get too old because of the bad rock music of the 1980s (I do not say that all the rock music of this period is bad), clothes and the general feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: First of all, this is not a true continuation of Fulci's cult classic. In fact, I do not know if this has already been done to pick up where the movie stopped. For those who do not know, Fulci was sick during production and eventually left and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are quite laughable, but like this movie, many people are having a good time. And that's all this movie really is, just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (average rating) 2/5 (Serious Review)
