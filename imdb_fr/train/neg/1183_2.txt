This, and Immoral Tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are edifying stories about what will happen if you have sex. As a film, it's not very well done - some actors really play an epic role (like the "American" woman with the French accent). The sudden sudden tilt of the young woman, who worried about the marriage to become interested (when it seems that it should have been the opposite), and the sudden realization of the secret of the young man by the aunt do not make sense - not explained at all. I also did not like how the girl's relationship with a black man was portrayed as a sign of perversion of her family or predilection for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there is this "sexy beast", if you will, who lives in the woods, could have served as a basis for a perverse but amusing story, but rather as a base for a nasty sex negative, morality game.
