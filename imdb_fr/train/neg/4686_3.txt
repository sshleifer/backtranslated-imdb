The performances of Robin Williams and others were good, but the film was overall dull and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I thought Sy could become a deadly serial killer: a desperate guy in ugly clothes is dragging his victims around food courts, quoting Oprah and reciting her medical history until they beg him to kill them. <br /> <br /> I think the film will appeal especially to the egoists who think that foreigners are interested in their photos. I expect most retail workers to want a break from customers.
