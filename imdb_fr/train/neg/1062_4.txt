Ouch! This one was a little painful to get through. It has a cute and fun premise, but everything goes away from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint for this one. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville performed surprisingly well. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, have been in full swing. I know that's how the roles were written, and it's hard to blame the actors when the script and the director ask them to do such a schlock. If you are going to have outrageous characters, it does not matter, but you must have good material for it to work. It's not here. Run away screaming from this movie if possible.
