Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of those people of the past who seems rather forgotten. I never thought his show was so great. This is his one-dimensional description of a crime leader, with very predictable results. If you take car chases and the general unleashes, there is not much development or intrigue. I find boring mafia films boring because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days, I will not remember much. Many shots, dying innocent bystanders, betrayals and sickly loyalty. The film is pretty well photographed and the acting is correct. But the dubbing is so bad (because of voices that just could not get out of those bodies), that I almost started looking for Godzilla coming up to the bay.
