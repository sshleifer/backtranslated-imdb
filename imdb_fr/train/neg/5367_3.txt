I saw every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering expectations of such a success as Gray's Anatomy. So I kept looking. I am afraid that the second season lacks charm, chemistry and especially the drama of his predecessor, Gray's Anatomy. The relationships seem artificial and the acting is mediocre. The writing lacks the intelligence and comic clues seen in GA. There are shows that a formula but do not feel like a formula and artificial, unfortunately, PP is not. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in Georgia. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is just not interesting.
