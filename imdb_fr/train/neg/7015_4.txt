"54" is a film based on the famous "Studio 54" of the 1970s - the meeting place of social elites and clubbers. In the movie, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on a current Studio employee from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem of the movie is that there is only flicker, style and not of substance. He tries to become a really filthy and disturbing satire, like "Boogie Nights", but ends up appearing as a lower aspirant. Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing with the owner of the cocaine sniffer club, Steve Rubell. It's a slightly comical role and if it was Myers' best attempt to slip into the drama as did Lemmon and other comic actors in their day, it's a total failure. <br /> <br /> "54" could have been insightful and it's interesting, but instead, it's just another stupid teen movie that is neither entertaining nor even engaging at a distance. See at your own risk.
