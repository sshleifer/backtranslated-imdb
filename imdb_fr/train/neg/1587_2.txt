Maybe television will be so brutal one day. Maybe "Big Brother" was just the first step in the direction indicated by Stephen "Richard Bachmann". But enough of that. If I spend too much time talking about the serious background topic of this film, I'm doing exactly what the producers were hoping for by choosing this material. It's the same with the 6th day. As primitive as it is, the film provokes a discussion on its subject, which serves as an advertisement to producers. Let's not be taken into account by that. The social criticism suggested by this summary of plot is only an excuse to produce a speculative and violent film, more for the sale of videos than cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without having read it, but when I saw the movie, I thought they could not make such a terrible movie out of a good book: In a typical scenario 1980s, composed of music of the 1980s and minor actors, Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman fleeing the murderers in a cruel television show. The audience is excited. <br /> <br /> With "Predator", it is the most stupid film of Schwarzenegger. 2 out of 10 stars.
