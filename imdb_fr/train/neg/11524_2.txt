Nice incoherent film about a man who belonged to a religiously superficial hippie cult of the 1960s and who fought it sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists who, during a police raid, is hidden and taken away by another man called Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its supporters or some people in the city. It is difficult to know who the characters are or the period during which the scenes are supposed to unfold. Sixteen years later, the leader is released on parole (I pulled him out of the box - I missed the time in the movie). Anyway, no one is made to look older. <br /> <br /> The assassination is committed with a large circular saw, the others with a knife or a crossbow. I have never heard the name of the title character mentioned in the film, but it is the one who looks most upset, screaming and screaming. <br /> <br /> The film is badly assembled, with a voiceover to explain what is happening. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man gets hit and we hear the crack of a whip. A woman shoots with a gun, and we do not hear it, but hear a ricochet! This does not seem to have been done for a comic effect.
