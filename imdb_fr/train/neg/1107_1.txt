I read the back of the box and he talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "wonderful! It will be great!" I was so wrong. The story was fucked. In fact, I still do not understand. It seems to me that all that the characters did was drink, smoke (opium?) And have sex. Not that they are not good cinematographic qualities, but please! Where was the story? I had the film finished, and yes, it started again towards the end, but at that moment, the film was almost finished. Rent it if you really want to. Just do not trust the back of the box.
