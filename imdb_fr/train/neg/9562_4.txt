I think it could have been a decent film, and some of its parts are OK ... but all in all it's a B movie. The same goes for the plot, the pieces are OK but there are several holes and quirks that do not add up. The act is generally good, I saw worse. :) <br /> <br /> The start sets the standard, with cars driving in the desert, making "cool" but totally useless jumps across some small dunes (Slow! Cool!), as drivers do not had never seen sand before ... It's slightly better from there, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent this, get another one and use it as a warm up. Keep the expectations low and it could work for you.
