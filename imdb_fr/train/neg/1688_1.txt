Gee, what a shitty movie it was! I can not understand what people find so scary about "The Grudge". The director plays a trick (I have to admit a very good one, which comes to life in a very stylized way) and repeats it again and again for the rest of the film. As a result, I was surprised several times at the beginning of the film, but once I experienced the exercise, I almost fell asleep as The Grudge became more and more predictable. To conclude, I can say that there are first better films of this kind, that the alleged predecessor "The Ring" was much more frightening and that the purchase of a ticket for "The Grudge" is a loss of money.
