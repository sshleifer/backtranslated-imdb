Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he shot after "Crimson Tide" seems to have brought him closer to the worst work of today (Michael Bay falls perhaps in the same category but at least his big, stupid and delusional epics entertain on a mostly perverse level). And like other outmoded Hollywood biopics ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," for example), which tell the stories of pretentious, overrated, downright superficial characters that a society thrives on is nourished. Juicy details behind the scenes, "Domino" is a film that starts with little potential and displays an infinitesimal amount before the end of the game. With a length of 128 minutes already well stretched, the film seems twice as long and spends time with characters as odious as superficial and forgettable (unlike the beautiful "Rules of Attraction", which try to color debates with irony via the Domino's sigh, The voice of rich and conscious girls only draws attention to the stupefaction of the sledgehammer) becomes an act that only masochists could find pleasant. The story? Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in an ersatz-badass performance as superficial as sublime in appearance) is tired of the superficial lifestyle of the rich and famous of Los Angeles, and addresses the huge bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting job; Along the way, there are crosses on two, shootings, the attention of the media (thanks to a pinch of the tongue, Christopher Walken, phoning in his sleazebag), and laughable allusions to romance. Scott cuts the film together in segments only rarely for more than a few seconds, reinforcing the resolution of making this film a neon-thirsty nightmare that is frankly unpleasant to watch - if Scott has the ability to shake an image, of the ghost, or distort it in a certain way, it will do it; but all this stunning stylistic overload overwhelms the little intrigue, characterization and suspense that the film has (to say nothing of its value, ehm, "entertainment"). Most of the characters are despicable or stereotyped, often both (watch the unbearable, multi-minute segment where an African-American features a new list of racial categorizations on "Jerry Springer"), and I thought I'd get them the "tails" end of our protagonist's piece by the end. "Domino" is pure waste - no interest for this individual that Scott hoped to inspire his audience, he lost himself a few minutes later in a sea of ​​pretensions neon causing migraine.
