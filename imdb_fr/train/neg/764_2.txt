The screenplay for this film on Columbo seems to have been taken from a television drama of the 1980s. The deeply character-oriented films are excellent, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this film, the only thing that convinced me was my desire to change channels. The villain's dialogue sounds as if it were written by a novelist. The great Lieutenant Columbo himself is not near his famous, adorable, self-effacing, collapsed self; and the bride / kidnapper is a damsel in mourning distress and one-dimensional (she fears a tiny scalpel carelessly held in the hand of her kidnapper - go! I could have knocked the scalpel out of her hand and gave her a blow foot in the you-know-what in 2 seconds). Whatever the meaning of reality, this character would have at least TRY to fight or retaliate at least a little. And speaking of reality, the story revolves around an abduction that is worked and resolved by the police. The police?? Leave me alone. Everyone knows that the FBI supports every abduction case. It was not Columbo, just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar Lieutenant Columbo writing and stretching up to 2 hours.
