Here is an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase "small budget" a horrible name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes a "molecular reorganization". Students are desperately killed by false coincidences of underwater sandwiches and school supplies. It sounds like a resurrection of classic B movies from the 50s, right? Nope! This is not an example of fun at the high camp, that is, far from the goal. A glamorous staging of breasts and buttocks stems from our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have been 99.44% more and more. The best of barrel background entertainment, aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies. Terrible films such as this would make GURU THE MAD MONK (1970), ultimately catastrophic, the work of an intelligent genius with a master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F" so stay calm!
