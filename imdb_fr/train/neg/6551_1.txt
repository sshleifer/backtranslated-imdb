A study in bad. Bad acting, bad music, bad script, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. Pieces of schlock do not come out more ridiculous or by chance more funny than that ... thing. At the end of the "movie", you wonder why they worried in the first place. Was poor Malcolm McDowell short of money or anything? Do you still think that? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you did not die laughing in the first thirty minutes, you will soon see the city populated by cyborg called "Cytown". Avoid that, my movie lover friends. To avoid.
