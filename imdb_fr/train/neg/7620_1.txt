I rented this movie because it sounded very interesting but for my horror, this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen! I read Gumby-8's commentary and he must be part of the cast or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old or a member of a cult cult, no one who does not fear anything would think this film has potential. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the comments of Gumby-8. <br /> <br /> Quote: "Opening animation inspired by fast-paced" Dune "... this film moves your eyes and works so well that the rehearsal is not unexpected. " <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the film that is interesting and the fact that the film keeps the eye moving is that you continue to search for any kind of suspense. I mean, give me a break. Halloween was filmed with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask. It has also become a cult classic. As far as "watching in rehearsal is not unexpected", I think he made a typo. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8, the only fan: "The acting is also an important aspect of the film." <br /> <br /> With all due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> The catchy slogan: "Pay attention to the hour between twilight and darkness" <br /> <br /> It's because there is no twilight or darkness darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> MPAA ranking "R rated for some violence / gore" <br /> The only gore you see There is red paint on a sheet laid on a corpse that you do not will never see. As far as I know, it could be a block of grass. <br /> <br /> In summary, I saw horror movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I saw what I thought was the worst and some very good. The director of this film made no attempt, was asleep or took a shot of acid. Whatever the case, I think that the actors deserve applause for trying to save a very bad job as a director. I would give this film a score of 0.5 for a movie "B".
