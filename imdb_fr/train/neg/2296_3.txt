"Back of Beyond" takes place in a dive station / gas station in the middle of the Australian desert led by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a difficult situation when visitors arrive unexpectedly . At first, we have what seems confusing and that looks like a flashback in which he and his sister (although their relations are better understood later in the film) run at full speed in the desert on his bike. After that, he appears as a terribly silent and sometimes gloomy character in front of the newcomers. <br /> <br /> We know one thing is certain: it is McGregor's spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such - his foresight is only slightly related to history, the big deal three diamond thieves whose cars break down and rely on Tom to help them get in the way without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls under the spell of one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, he opposes the three allies already suspicious. But not in a way that really leads to something much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to want to build something important, but fails to do it. Even the end, which unfolds like a banal campfire story (and which reveals many narrative flaws), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may be worth trying to keep in mind the extremely slow pace, but at least you have the atmosphere to do something a little different from the usual.
