Well, what was fun ... apart from the fun part. <br /> <br /> This is my second favorite in less, so far, I even thought it was worse than "Lazarus" and "Ghost in the Machine". <Br /> <br /> Let's start with good. The teaser was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover I am, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But there is all the harm and believe me, there are many. Few sense, then these animals were abducted by extraterrestrials and impregnated? whaaa ??? the dialogue was also pretty horrible. There were about one or two lines mentioned. <br /> <br /> And even worse, killing just about all these animals was very uncomfortable for me. In the end ... what's the point? they are almost all dead. We did not learn anything, we did not have fun and I could not even find Sophia's death sad ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * star. a shame because season 2 was going so well.
