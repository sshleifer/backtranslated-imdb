The only word I can think of to describe this movie is: Regular. <br /> <br /> The plot of the plot about the character of Gary Sinise who tries to commit suicide is a ridiculous premise and it's like a sort of salingerist hermit or solitary in a hut driving golf balls into the ocean because he could not handle life in the lucrative pro / am golf community? Cry Me A River. I wish it were my problems. I really appreciate Dylan Baker and Sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a paycheck for Sinise. The scene in which little Timmy Price is verbally assaulted by the other member of the club in front of his father during the tournament is so excessive that I am embarrassed to watch him.
