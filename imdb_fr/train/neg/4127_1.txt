A movie as bad as this one should be removed from all the stores around the world. So full of boring characters, boring and unimaginative, and with a main character with such a boring attitude and a dry voice that gives an unthinking voice for every action and every feeling, this film holds the record for the most difficult film that I have never seen. As I had paid money to be the owner, I felt compelled to carry it out and to regret it. My head ached all the time because of the terribly sad characters and their useless lives. A group of children who have no knowledge whatsoever, are all icy and, worse yet, have a dreadful dialogue throughout their lives, ruminating while the main character is trying to get a go with the girl. I was bored, so much so that my friend trembled with hatred and I was embarrassed to have thrown Â£ 6. The DVD was on eBay the next day and I did not get much money back. Avoid like the plague.
