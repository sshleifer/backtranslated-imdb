Low plot, predictable violence, semi-interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) Used his own mistakes and added unbelievable fantasies of drugs and murder to make him "hot". From house-to-house rap and soundtrack to family conflict, it's misinterpreted, stereotyped and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has already been done before - IMDb lists FIVE films of the same name released in 2007-2008! <br /> <br /> Note: Saw it on Showtime, which lists the synopsis of one of the other films. I was halfway to realize that no one was a police officer under cover. Even another stereotype would have made it interesting.
