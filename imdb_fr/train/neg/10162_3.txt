This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real: "That's how the people of the Ohio Valley are!" I come from the region and I experienced the film as follows: "That's what people in California think!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked at the minimum wage. We laughed a lot, we made connections and took breaks with people of our age; the young people went out together at night. Older people had little free time after work because they cared for their families. The area is beautiful in summer and not darker in winter than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Apart from the "if you live in a prefabricated house, you must be depressed", the story lacks any element of charm, mystery or even fright. <br /> <br /> Martha's character was the worst. It is doubtful whether anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had done so, she would probably have made friends. I've read reviews that seem to assume that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, prettier and slimmer", but if that's the case, it's not showing up. In fact, all we see is that Martha learns to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply equally if the three friends were the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling excluded during the smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social projects are developed, used but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt. <br /> <br /> Just one last thing: are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had some panic attacks? Please. This brings the stigma against mental illness to a new level.
