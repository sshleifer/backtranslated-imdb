Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting at those who shoot people. Then he goes to Malta where he pulls more people. He is often locked up for shooting people. Then he fights with the villain, dressed as a monk. There is a boat chase and Joe Don finds himself in prison again. Finally, Joe Don, with Elaine's help from "Seinfeld", kills the villain, detonates a boat or two and gets shot with a flare. All this and a catchy song, just like Mitchell!
