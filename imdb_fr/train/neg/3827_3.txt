A stereotypical western, derivative, without originality and boring. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both perform far from being better and rightly so; they both have superficial roles and character traits set out mainly through dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "loved the world as he was before" and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt". Moreover, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding and Coburn is mean and tough, but not as murderous as one of the minor killers. Apparently, the filmmakers could not offer ONE ONLY original idea on how to make this film a little bit daring. (* 1/2)
