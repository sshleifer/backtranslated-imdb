I do not know if users should be allowed to watch movies after only half a session, but I'm afraid I can not stay a minute longer. <br /> <br /> If this apology abjects "I do not doubt that everything will go well. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above" This is not a film for fans of Parsons "summarizes the essence of my feelings: how can a director (screenwriter) and a (second-rate) scriptwriter attempt something they are so clearly incapable of giving life to? What were they thinking? Where do I start? <br /> <br /> SCRIPT: I thought I had a part of bittersweet americana What I had was poorly executed, without clich√© Stupid hippie Check ... Stupid big cop? Check. Terrible machinations of Intrigue? Check. Embarrassing female characters? Recheck. Total disregard for the story you are trying to tell? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while, you realize that what you are looking at is a soap opera and not very well written Scene with Knoxville Scene with the ex girlfriend Scene with Knoxville who did not move much Scene with Ex girlfriend who was a bit like the last. And so on ... <br /> <br /> THE DIRECTION: My friends and I decided, after much thought, to look at it was like watching a bad episode of Quincy, or maybe a Hazzard duke particularly poor. That's how bad the management was. Terrible jumping cuts, terrible camera work, awkward entries and exits in the scenes. My god, it was great. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman whose most remarkable recent work is a really ugly drama of the BBC Sunday night titled Monarch of the Glen (believe me, it's the TV whose common denominator is the lowest). And then everything made sense ... <br /> <br /> ACTION: Are we now so critical that when any guy on television decides to try his luck, if he is not? no less, he stinks to applaud his efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT managed to cross all the scenes. Poor Christina A. is not so lucky. His performance is a car accident (although what you do with these lines, I do not know). The "hippie" in the hearse: oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Have not we left since Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you understand my drift. What I would say is that, as other critics have mentioned, no one in this film is clearly interested in The Byrds, Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They knew nothing about the American road movie and did not care to try to do anything with a decent history of rock mythology. This film was superficial, he did not explore anything and his jaw was not funny from the beginning to ... oh, wait, I'm not quite finished. And I suggest you stay away too.
