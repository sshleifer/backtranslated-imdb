Seriously, the only good thing about this year's ceremony is the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was quite short, it was still a little boring. I think it's really time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something REALLY new. It's pretty obvious that they've been trying to make the show more "hip" and appealing to a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce play and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Leaving Chris Rock on the presenter was also an attempt to revive the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of this really worked. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny guy, but he was not really a good presenter. I only really saw him as a guy who occasionally spoke between different categories. His presence was not as big as that of Billy Crystal, for example. <br /> <br /> The award ceremony was also rather silly. Not letting everyone come on the scene, but also distributing some of the awards in the middle of the theater was just strange. <br /> <br /> However, I do not remember being more satisfied with the winners. No film has really erased the awards, as has always been the case in recent years. Does this mean that the year has been good for movies with a lot of competitors? I do not think so. I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten within 20 years, with the possible exception of "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of Christ". Of course, I do not agree with all the awards that have been handed out this year, for example Caleb Deschanel should have won the prize for Best Photography, not that I do not like the work of Robert Richardson, he has really did a fantastic job for most Oliver Stone movies. but I really think that Deschanel deserved more the prize. I would have liked to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win the Best Editing Award and John Debney for Best Music. But there is no chance that the Oscars will please everyone, of course, I understand it. There will always be people who will complain about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also fun to see that most presenters were much more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince say that one of the candidates was named right away? And what was Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed" The irons were the best presenters of the evening. <br /> <br /> Overall, this show is very memorable, but it has beautiful winners. <br /> 4/10
