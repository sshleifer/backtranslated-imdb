Anyone who has seen the original should come out and destroy this awful remake. Alex Baldwin trying to emulate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word-by-word remake just does not work. Even though Baldwin did an admirable job, it's a failure from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said. McQueen looked dangerous, threatening and credible as Doc, the film was exciting and suspenseful, Baldwin and company made a comedy, I laughed the one and only time I saw this miserable movie. And this appalling hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of the most exciting and credible actors of today! Did makeup people want Michael, what did they think? If you would like to see a film shoot as it was under the direction of Sam Peckinpah Get the original!
