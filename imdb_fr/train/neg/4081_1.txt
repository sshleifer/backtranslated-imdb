This is not the worst movie I've seen from Peter Greenaway, but it's close. This disgrace goes to the worst pillow book. The films of this director out of 3 that I saw, I find them all miserable. Like The Cook ..., whatever its positive film content, it is absolutely not recovered by the lack of presentation of its material and global presentation.
