That's the kind of movie my enemies just watch all the time, but it's not true. I only look at it from time to time to make sure it's as bad as I originally thought. <br /> <br /> Some types of gangsters hijack a Boeing 747. (That's at least an improvement over having Boeing hijack a lot of the Pentagon.) The plane descends into the Bermuda Triangle and sinks under pressure, a kind of post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> He owns one of these star throws. , stars falling or barely above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We are alone!" says Jack Lemon. He is so right. With the exception of George Kennedy. He is in all these catastrophic films. <br /> <br /> Look at another movie instead. Oh, not "Airport" the original. It's not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie about blocked planes like "Flight of the Phoenix".
