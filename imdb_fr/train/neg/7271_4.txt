It could have been the gay counterpart of Gone With The Wind given its epic length, but instead it was just a huge chain of empty episodes in which nothing happens. The characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in history (there is in fact no story either) than to look for and kiss each other. It is unfortunate that an interesting aesthetic proposition, such as having almost no dialogue, is completely wasted in a film than making no effort to examine the psychology of its characters with dignity and achieve true emotional resonance. In addition to that, he claims to be an "art" film using the worst naive snaps of cinematic snobbery. Anyway, if anyone can identify with his great banality, I guess that's fine.
