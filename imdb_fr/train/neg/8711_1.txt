OK ..... This is the third in the series of carnosaurs. Lets play with dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie, you can not see the cause of Dino when the countdown begins, you can only see the vision of Dino, smart enough to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes ahead of the movie, a special team with Scott Valentine as Rance leader, the team will go into the warehouse and then they will start finding body parts and corpses after Dino's rampage . After a while, a big box arrives if we fail in the team, we hear a cry of velociraptor, quite scary !!! and then a black girl walks forward and now a blooper is found! This makes a raptor's hand appear and cuts his face, but if you stop when the raptor's hand arrives, you can see that he's just a guy with a hand puppet !? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorists attack trucks because they wash weapons there. 2. They are really wrong to give ten tons of raptor and a giant t-Rex! How did the t-Rex find its place ??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately, a stupid blonde girl told him to capture one of them alive = (4. The holy Jesuits, the raptors have cogs on their exploits!) 5. The Dino is now on a boat in the Pacific. 6: Strange, I did not know that the t-Rex had a strange thing on his neck ??? 7. END The film is good if you want to laugh well 5/10
