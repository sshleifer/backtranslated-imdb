What a misfortune to have so much of my "a" list and good "b" actors agree to do this movie, but that's what they did, and that's what made me look at it. I had never heard of this film, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. on the DVD cover, and James Woods in the background, how bad can it be? In a word, very! This movie starts o.k. has some twists, then just lays an egg. The end was so weak that it was as if the writer had been called and his 4-year-old son had sat in front of the typist and had chopped the end. How ironic for a movie called "The End Game" to have such a poor movie. These are the types of movies that can quickly move the actors in the list to the "b" list. I hope that Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not get used to this.
