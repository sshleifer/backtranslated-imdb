Sarafina's concept seems to be sound, outside the musical perspective. He tries to combine an optimistic African music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and the atmosphere that blacks were forced to undergo at the time of filming. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid changes between jubilation and terror. If it was simply a drama reflecting these conditions, it might be a good movie. However, the scenes of children shot by soldiers shot by soldiers are not exactly beside the songs. <br /> <br /> Apart from the mediocre premises, the game of the actors is not the best either, Goldberg gives a mediocre performance, just like the rest of the actors. Overall, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
