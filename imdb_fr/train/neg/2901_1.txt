The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on IMDb just made me understand that their Junket employees are working hard to get people to watch this absolutely horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I do not have words. I do not know where to start to describe the really awful movie I spent last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to think that I would feel something for his character and that I would appreciate the dialogue, but that, like the other posters, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the distribution. Was it the Walton family cookie cutter and the movie was so many times before I was shocked someone thought it was an original idea. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terribly bad movie and don Do not believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in a different theater watching a good movie.
