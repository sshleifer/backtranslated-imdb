This 1973 televised remake of Billy Wilder's classic is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb is an excellent Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but he's the only reason to look at that. The only improvement of this remake compared to the original is that it reduces the role of Lola Dietrichson, the stepdaughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's it for the good things. <br /> <br /> The bad things are many. The director records everything indifferently: if you watch the movie with the sound muted, you will hardly feel that something particularly interesting is happening. Because of the bad modern taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Because of the bad taste of the 1970s, all sets are ugly and distracting. The expensive apartment of Walter Neff, in particular, is hideous. <br /> <br /> Modern surroundings hurt in many ways. Train travel was a little more unusual in the 1970s than in the 1940s, so Mr. Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more artificial. The men stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering his brown hair by pretending to be Mr. Dietrichson with white hair. The women in mourning have stopped wearing veils, which deprives Samantha Eggar of an accessory, Barbara Stanwyck, has made excellent use of it in a key scene. (Strangely, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her mother-in-law was trying on a black hat and veil before she needed it.) <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco retains much of the script Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler the same. But he brings many inexplicable changes to the dialogue, which leave the scenario slightly flaccid where he was formerly lean and muscular. The famous joke of motorcycle cops is over, but look good and you will see what looks like a post-production cut where these lines should have been. Bochco may not be to blame. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is okay like Walter Neff. What could have made this version tolerable is a truly splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we get Samantha Eggar, who presents herself as a nasty, ordinary "Barnaby Jones" question. But who can blame Eggar? With a director who seems barely interested in what's happening on camera, how did Barbara Stanwyck cope?
