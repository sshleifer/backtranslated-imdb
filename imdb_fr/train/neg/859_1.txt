I recently caught this stinking bomb of a movie on a cable channel and I remembered how much I thought it was terrible in 1980, on its first outing. Many critics are not old enough to remember the huge hype surrounding this film and the fight between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The extremely popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposedly "master" director put this supernatural story to multiple layers on the screen. "Salem's Lot" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a mini-television series directed by Tobe Hooper (himself famed for "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and had been mishandled. "Vampire without any real threat, destroying the whole premise." The fans were hoping that a director of Kubrick's stature would succeed where Hooper had failed, but that was not the case. <br /> <br /> Good Sure, this film is superb and has a great opening sequence, but after these few achievements, everything is down ... Jack Nicholson can only be Jack Nicholson, he's still crazy and has not brought anything to his role here. I do not care what a lot of critics here think it's all that in this clinker, the "Here's Johnny!" Still ... it's just awful in this movie, so is everyone else. Scatman Crothers, Dick Halloran, was essential to the book's plot, but Kubrick kills him in one of the deadliest "shock" sequences ever recorded, and I remember the audience in the theater that I saw breaking in repetition in the last 45 minutes of this bad movie, those who I have remained who have stayed ... many are gone. King's books never really translate well in the movies, because much of the stories occur inside his characters, and often in a metaphysical way. Kubrick has released the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting disaster ends so far from the original material that we do not really care what happens to who. <br /> <br /> This film stinks and why so many people think it's a masterpiece of horror overtakes me.
