After seeing the film trailer for the movie, I thought it was an original concept for a thriller, placing it in the competitive world of computer companies. The cast of the stars was another message that this movie would probably be good. But when I did not go to watch him during the first week of his release, he disappeared in the second week. I was afraid I missed something. Patiently, I waited for the release of his DVD, then I bought it in a hurry for a nice evening. The anticipation on the way back was much better than the movie. For starters, management is appalling. There is no thought about it and the director is a role so that he can appear in the film. I would not rush to use it in the future. Second, the lead role is completely misunderstood by Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is normally a great character, as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun, but he is supposed to be a stupid hero that he tries to describe slipping when he runs and having geeky friends, but he does not seem right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani, are not present enough, but when they do, none of the performances are closer to their best. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been done for him. It is his fiery temperament and his mysterious ways that drive the film. The last point is that this movie is another movie that fills the trailer with scenes that you do not see in the movie and that appear only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment because, although some of these scenes are rudimentary, they fill important gaps in history.
