My first opinions about this movie were of course bad. I was expecting a horrible and miserable acting game, a bad entertainment, a silly special effects movie. What I got was actually not that bad. The special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually quite good and decent. The acting was not that bad, and overall, I had fun watching this movie. It's still a very bad film, but it's not completely nil, as I thought, and I'm glad to know that this film has managed to amaze me, even if It was not so good. Basically, it's a movie you have to avoid, but for me it was not as bad as I expected.
