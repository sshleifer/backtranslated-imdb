Spoiler!! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but THIS - <br /> <br /> I can understand an actor's desire to stretch , to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did it, but really - the screenplay was cast on it, Bonham-Carter's clothes were very classy, ​​and the accelerated "crazy" occasional sequence could have been a Beatles movie release, or old Rowan and Martin Laugh-En. <br /> <br /> I never understood what I meant - other commentators say that Branagh's character was a dreamer. I never felt that way. He was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. The business with the bank robber disguise was simply painful to watch. Certainly not fun. <br /> <br /> Bonham-Carter's realistic (presumably) attempts at realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire's "Full Monty" accent. <br /> <br /> The poetic end, with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of her plane was too orchestrated. Was there a choir of angels or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Come back to the classics or something with a spine and a bow. Give this to PBS. <br /> <br />
