I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. I remember that the film was premised on the group of hotel occupants attacked by men-eating ants. What I did not remember was how awful it was !!! <br /> <br /> I recently caught this movie on TV late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake because films like this one usually disappear from existence and should never be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the peak of her career as Chrissy in "Three's Company") plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Building workers install a pool outside and accidentally disturb an ant nest. Or should I say, a * NICK OF ANTS MAN EVER MAN * !! One of the workers is actually attacked by the ants. One minute, he removes his clothes one by one, the next minute he covers them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the earth. <br /> <br /> If you think this is pretty far-fetched, you should see Myrna Loy play with a wheelchair resident coming out of the Manor by helicopter! I could almost imagine her thinking with relief that she was coming out of the movie! <br /> <br /> The last scenes represent Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room, his back turned. each other, blowing through straws and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> It's basically the movie. There is really no call "disaster" or "big star" to the movie. It was supposed to be a "large-scale" televised event at the time. Now, it's lucky that your local TV station rejects it at 4am. <br /> <br /> If you want to surprise Suzanne Somers, watch an episode of Three's Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy do something to put bread on the table and pay the bills, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
