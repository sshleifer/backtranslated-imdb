A failure. The movie was just not good. It has the humor that the 5 year olds do not even laugh. I mean, of course, some parts were fun, but most are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and she should work on better movies. The film should have been released as an original Disney Channel movie, that is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well done about this movie is the music. Nothing like a soundtrack rock redone to brighten your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda, Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter, Beach Boy Song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I give it 10, 9 will be music and 1 will be the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
