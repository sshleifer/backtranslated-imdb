This film was abominable. and not in a good way as some have claimed. First, the main character is a very unattractive ginger. Second - WTF continues with this van love. The plot, basically, is this: a boy wants sex, so he buys a van (which, in all fairness, is pretty cool). Incredibly, since he looks like a newt, he scores with a lot of chicks! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a really hot girl and realizes he loves this fierce bird that played a lot. Then he goes shopping with the boyfriend of hot girls. And he rocks his van. At this point, danny devito records the day. Although he did not need it, the ginger kid crossed the finish line first. I gave this 2 * as I am willing to assume that there is some sort of Vanning subculture of the 70's that I do not get and also because there are some 70's boobages too.
