This tasteless mini-operetta featuring an Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad that it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. This is ridiculous from the start, while this brevity opens the way for two soldiers who discuss the lack of virility in the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute, he is sent back to Morocco where he leads a double life under the name of Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe who would rather sing than fight. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have fine opera voices (not very good at playing). scenes so random, so unprepared that you feel they are inventing things as you go. <br /> <br /> These two films are part of a larger theatrical production that lists six authors. With more parody and heckling space, the show may have entertainment values, but this hasty quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the movie.
