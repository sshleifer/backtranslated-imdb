Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long, original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid to watch the movie when it was released in theaters in 1985. It's awful. Almost everything fails. First of all, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a sad choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to turn ANNIE. The camera is still in the wrong place - they cut out the songs and the CASTING !!! They are awful - the power of the piece lies in these dancers - these talented and hungry performers simply wanted the opportunity to show what they could do and when they had the opportunity - you could not take their eyes off them. But this cast is content to dance, makes a "beautiful" song but does not cause any concern. In fact, watch the cast on IMDb - none of them really did much. (OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So, this movie trainwreck does not capture for a second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the musical. A total radiation! (But even if they try to smother the music, the good music gets up sometimes and reminds people how good the score was).
