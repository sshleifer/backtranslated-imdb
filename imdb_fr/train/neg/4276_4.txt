This overestimated and ephemeral series (two meager seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a striptease bar. I'm not quite sure what they mean by "innovative" and "original" when they sneak into Lynch and his idiot little TV. What exactly are their criteria of what is original? Of course, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues", it's original. Absolutely. Next to "Law & Order", TP diffuses originality on the left and right. <br /> <br /> TP fans often say that the series was canceled because too many viewers were not smart enough, open enough for the so-called "weirdness". ", his so-called savage ingenuity, or something else.As a fan of strangeness myself, I have to correct this misconception.There is nothing too casual about TP, it's a simply observable whodun, rather idiot who turns in circles, canvases that turn in all corners but (or because of that) do not lead anywhere now.The alleged strangeness is always forced, the characters do not behave as strangely as they are IDIOTICALLY INCLUDE half the time There is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Whenever I look at the sequence of the "strange dream" in "Living In Oblivion" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for having succumbed to the tired old man - Cliche of a dream scene, I think about Lynch Do you want weird? "Eraserhead" is strange - in fact, it's beyond the strange, it's is basically abstract You want a unique TV show? Watch "The Pri "You want a strange casting? The films of Felini and Leone offer this. TP looks like a police drama, overdressed, in which all young people look like models. The casting gives TP a plastic aspect. Kens & Barbies en masse. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the TP producers said Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle's? Sheryll Fenn? Do you like these "guys" with an effeminate face straight out of men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not mistake yourself; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (as Madonna would have if it were 1000 times prettier), but then do not keep saying you're doing a "strange show" with strange people ". And I never understood Lynch's lost fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal for spelling his name correctly). It is not implausible but lacks charisma, a little too bland and polite. The ludicrous "eccentricities" of his character were not at all interesting, it was simply one of Lynch's many attempts to force strangeness, striving to live up to his reputation - having him completely lost his advantage, but that moment. All that Lynch did after "Elephant Man" was well below normal compared to her first two films. This often resulted in mediocre efforts that relied on Lynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting the meanings of his ill-prepared stories that do not get close attention. In other words, Lynch is the darling of all intellectual aspirants. <br /> <br /> Laura Palmer was killed by her father ...? He was obsessed with the devil or such nonsense. This is the best that this "great spirit" can have ... You have horror movies of B movies that end with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not brilliant enough nor hard worker to tell a fantastic story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and discover my "TV & Cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism".
