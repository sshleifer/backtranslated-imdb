Tim Robbins is strangely benevolent here in New Jersey in the 1950s, he plays the garage and falls in love with a beautiful blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he is on the screen much of the time, Robbins cancels the inner workings of his intense character and fades into the background (it is easy to forget that he is even in the picture!). A romantic comedy with a gadget, Walter Matthau plays Einstein (who does what he can with a caricatured character). Otherwise, it's soft and sunny, led rather slyly by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no spirit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable personality and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like that of a loving sister and her older brother. ** from ****
