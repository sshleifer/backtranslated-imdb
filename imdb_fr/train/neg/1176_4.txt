Revolutions still offer opportunities for dramatic films because, in reality, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what is missing from the film in this film is offset by an overabundance of boredom. We do not care who wins, loses, dies or lives - we just have to stop it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. The scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a quality of cardboard. They could be best done on a bare stage and left that way. One can not expect the amazing effects of "The House of Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass", but, after all, it is a digitized 2002 production. The characters seem to enter a scene for the pleasure of entering a scene, to the point that we lose count of the number of entries and exits of character. In my opinion, this film makes the French Revolution of the 1790s the "paper-mache" revolution of the "paper glue" world.
