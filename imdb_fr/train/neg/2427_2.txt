Do not get me wrong, I love action and revenge movies, I've seen a lot since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's last "The Mechanik", which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use a camera and could even be a genius of filming and editing. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and more with "Domino"), Scott shows that Rather than cleverly using his talents as "genius" in making movies, he shamelessly serves to show and compensate for a lack of substance that his material does not offer him. "Man of Fire" is nearly 2 Â½ hours when it would have taken at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott shot and edited this movie also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to watch his movie because his constant camera movements and flashes are really a torture for the eyes and make you want to leave the theater or extinguish it after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The MPAA and the studios have dubious attitudes regarding ratings, violence and the making of PG-13 films. I also find it suspicious that a $ 70 million movie is a B movie script with a finger-cutting character, a bomb in the ass of a man blows the hand of a guy with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who is not even dead! Go understand then why a studio will pass a better scenario because of language or violence ... So ...
