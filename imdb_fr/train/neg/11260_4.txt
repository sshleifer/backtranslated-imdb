This film should be called "joseph smith's plan 9". I think his strangeness is underestimated. the author seems to have read paul ehrlich's "population bomb (1968)" and created a musical response specifically designed for Mormons. The goal of the play is for as many children as possible to be part of the plan of "Heavenly Father" (of God). and all that prevents to have more babies is very bad. get it? <br /> <br /> This version was shot in 1989, which is confusing. it's utah, so it looks like it's 1983, the play was written in 1973, and of course, theology is part of 1840, battlestar galactica. part of the action takes place on earth and others in the "pre-existence", a purposeless meeting room where annoying children wait to get their bodies back so they can come back down, try not to slam the door of the missionaries , losing their shot in celestial combat glory. <br /> <br /> It's as theatrical as they come, but do not let the poor theaters spoil your appreciation of this crazy Mormon universe where "cool kids" are all in control of the population, (probably) advice their parents do not want to have children anymore !! having large families was, at the time of writing the play, the cultural norm of the LD community and, more importantly, considered part of God's plan. Family planning has been chosen by parents and large families are much less the cultural norm at the moment. It is therefore essential to make film doctrine a modern Mormon principle! <br /> ahhh but it's really as good as the music. there are some catchy tunes here that will not let this film Die Death of the 1970s, it was pre-destined. the brother and sister are singing love songs that make you wonder if anything else was going on there - wink. and the tough and cool children make the new kids in the neighborhood look like metallica. so congratulations to all that! gather the whole family, make jell-o shooting games and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
