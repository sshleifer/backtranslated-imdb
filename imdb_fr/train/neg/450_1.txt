This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> It's obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this program, whether it's "jobs", boyfriends and actors in constant evolution. It seems they wanted to throw Amanda Bynes into something ... but did not know what, and they created this shitty show. They projected her as a teenager, surrounded by twenty and thirty years, and placed her in mostly adult situations at failed comedy attempts several times. Soon, they realize she needs a "clique" and throw people in their late twenties to try to become a teenager. <br /> <br /> The way this show has survived for four seasons goes beyond me. In one way or another, ABC has now decided that it was a "family" show and incorporated it into its afternoon programming on ABC Family.
