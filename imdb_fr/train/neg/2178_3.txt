I would have liked this movie a little more than Jason (Herb) Evers had not stopped harassing his experiences. Many early readers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of acting excessively. Yet, as more and more critics watched this film, they saw it as being done on purpose. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his suraction is exactly what it takes. <br /> <br /> Most actors in this classic are pretty good, apart from Evers and showgirls. If you watched this movie, you would have noticed that Evers was shouting almost all the aftershocks, that is to say until he smoked and gently blowing the smoke on his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were identical to the course in a film B such as this one. In hindsight, there is not much that seems fantastically good or bad for this film.
