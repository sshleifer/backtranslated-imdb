Honestly, I can not believe what is happening for entertainment now. Death (and laughing at death), violence, sexual insinuations, adults threatening children, cruelty, underage drinking, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, the police, the big ones of the house in the middle of the night - yes, it sounds like a children's movie - NOT !!! Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman owning and transforming a house keeping her husband in love imprisoned inside for over 20 years, and also terrorizing a whole neighborhood - how sweet life for children. PARENTS - This is really what you want your kids to look at - is this what you want to teach them about life ?! <br /> <br /> This film is too scary for young children and I'm afraid that teenagers Today, some of the film's scenarios may be in the making - so why not rub them? in the face? As for an adult audience - you will not find it scary or amusing - but boring, artificial and predictable. And the characters are simply wrong: distraught parents, ignorant police, stupid and boring friends, naughty and manipulative babysitters, and boyfriends drinking beer / pregnant women. What excellent material for children - does it really look like a children's movie? Even the computer animation and the good vocal work are not enough to buy this terrible film. Save money, save time and save the spirit of your kids - rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Shrek, The Life of an Insect - Any of them are way better than this movie horrible. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on you two for causing such a disaster and calling it a movie for children / family !!
