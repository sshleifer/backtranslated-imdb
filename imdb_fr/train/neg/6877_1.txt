I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico and ended up watching one on the Nuyoriciens. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see the 50% who live in poverty. When I see people in trouble, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans recently arrived on the island. Spanglish does not exist ... either you speak Spanish or you do not ... and from what I've heard ... you do not know. Pedro Albizo Campos is NOT MLK for me. MLK was a big man. Campos is a great man for those who want a 1% independence. For the rest, he is as famous as Osama Bin Laden. Puertoricans who want independence are a bunch of imbeciles. If you want proof to anyone dreaming of Puerto Rico's independence, see Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, all the countries of Central and South America and Mexico. Its doing wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, it was about the Nuyoriciens and their struggles. <br /> <br /> For the one who complained that there was not enough Africa in the series ... it was supposed to be about Puerto Rico ... not Africa . Denzel will make one soon for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... to all these ignorant Whites who think we need green cards to come to the United States and want to learn how the Prime Minister manages things, it's not a good documentary about Puerto Rican culture. Tell your children to pay attention to geography and history classes. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." was on the Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if it was what we all feel. Should have been titled ... "yo soya nuyorican ... lunch ... do not speak spanish." PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATE TO THE PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LESSON. God forbid, they play this on the island.
