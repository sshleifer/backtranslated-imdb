If you like to comment on movies whose script comes half way through, this is it. A scene and acting like in a porn movie but nothing happens that a few trial and touching of the third type. What really gets really boring after 45 minutes of difficult play but without action. Some of the actors I saw in real rated movies and where their game was so much better. All the special effects are made by the great "Rondo" who performs all the magic with his spirit. A cult movie is written on the box. Does this mean that this film should absolutely not be viewed ??? <br /> <br /> Get drunk with friends and watch this movie on New Year's Eve or more by thanking.
