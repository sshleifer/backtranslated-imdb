At the beginning of the film, the beautiful photography and the fox scenes were incredible. However, the story was so slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see foxes. One thing everyone should know is that you let wild animals be and you love them from a distance. This film gives a terrible example to the children who will watch it, trying to turn a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what was the purpose of the story. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl still wanted to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes featuring fox predatory animals, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this film. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a horrible story she tells. The final dialogue was so stupid, at that time, my wife and I were screaming on TV! I absolutely hated this movie and I would never recommend it to anyone!
