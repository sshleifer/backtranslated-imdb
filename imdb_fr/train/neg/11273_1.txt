How can you gather this respectable group of young British actors and create such a heap of filmic manure? Horrible scenario, annoying camera, horribly mounted, terribly badly played. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fulfill his role of life. Another painful proof that "different" sometimes equals "dreck". Why do people of money fail to read scripts in advance? Do yourself a favor: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet on your lap. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
