Most of the book adaptations are bad, but this film has left out key parts of the story and has changed the description and some characters. They rewired the storyline and the scenes combined to change the order. They added ridiculous things that never happened in the book and that would never happen. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book in advance, it would have been an incredibly boring movie, it did not worry you. on the characters, like them or do not like them. This turns the characters into jokes. <br /> <br /> Disgusting. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Two hours of my life lost.
