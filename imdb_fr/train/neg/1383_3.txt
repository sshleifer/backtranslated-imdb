Blade, action movie superhero drivel shot. I had high hopes for this film, and the kind of friends of HK buddy is a genre that I do not despise, but very rarely, I see a scenario as banal and ridiculous as this one. It would have been forgivable, as is always the case in such films, when the action compensates, unfortunately, this is not the case. The action bears the surrealist mark and goes beyond the very nature of HK's action, but it is not very engaging, obscurely gory and in fact often completely inconsistent patchwork places). I was very disappointed.
