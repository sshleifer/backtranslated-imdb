The problem with CONTRACTER is summed up by the opening scene. The CIA wants the death of an international terrorist, so contact the murderer of the police, James Dial. The terrorist appears in the Old Bailey court in London, raising the question of why he wants to overthrow a terrorist if he will spend the rest of his life in prison. It's going to be out of circulation anyway. Did the CIA have no chance before his arrest? If by chance he gets a verdict of not guilty, kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will live in a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Since the places base the story, the public can choose to ignore the plot, but the assertion itself fuels the fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they drive in collisions, but Dial manages to escape. So the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car accident? The movie of this type of conspiracy conspiracy. Later, Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him and claiming that "this airport is surrounded by armed copper," but Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation. The whole movie deceives its audience by relying on things that are never explained. This includes an important secondary character called Emily Day. Why does she help Dial even if he is a wanted fugitive? Your guess is as good as mine <br /> <br /> This is a pretty mediocre thriller that should not be interpreted by the "big names" cast. Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a movie star, but ended his career by playing in more and more unimportant movies. Charles Dance has also appeared in big-budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but again, he is best known for appearing directly in DVD movies, and is essentially a cameo. People like Lena Headey may become big movie stars, but they will certainly put THE CONTRACTER on their resume.
