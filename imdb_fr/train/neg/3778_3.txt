Decent animation and achievable character development allow this animated DreamWorks fable to stay at least observable ... but it's still a bit slow and the screenplay is a bit silly .. It's interesting to see a reversal of Indian roles but here it just seems to be a nod to the politically correct rather than a proper decision. Rank: C
