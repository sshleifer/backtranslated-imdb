If you have seen friends, the writing will seem very familiar to you. Especially the last three or four seasons of Friends often share the same comedy setups. <br /> <br /> The show talks about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same course when they were still quite young (about years old I think). Now they are in their mid-twenties and meet up in a class meeting. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with several scenarios simultaneously. They are usually not connected in any way. Each scenario is divided into several sections, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> Sketches are the source of my problems with this series. As in the last seasons of Friends, it's often a rather idiotic frame with situations hard to believe. One of the main characters does something really stupid and hard to believe. The situation is then strongly exaggerated, as if it was not stupid enough. If you like that kind of humor, you may like this series. For me, it's great. <br /> <br /> If I started to watch Friends, it's because of the first seasons. There are interesting and particularly credible stories, with a little romance that make you take root for the characters. The class has none of this. The characters are just too forced and the stereotypes are pushed too far. It is therefore not possible to be in touch with them and to love them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it took several seasons for her to run out of steam and all traits to be exploited. But in The Class, it seems that she has run out of steam before she even starts.
