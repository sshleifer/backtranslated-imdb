I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis because you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot, anyway. I have seen several critics describe ISOYG as an "anti-rape" film or even a feminist statement, and I need only comment on the overwhelming hypocrisy of these claims. <br /> <br /> First of all, what to do? we see on the cover of this film? That's right: a well-made woman is behind. Whether it is Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely do not believe it was the case - is utterly out of place. The film deals with sex and sexual turmoil, and the material is so graphic (everything but real penetration is shown) that no one other than hard-working crowd will appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The rape (s)) in the movie is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There is something to be said about having presented a horrible crime from such a brutal angle, but there was no reason for this scene to continue for apparently 30 minutes, none. The victim has also changed little in his character and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (a few moments before his assassination), so that the scene has no emotional commitment. Really, it's just been introduced to show extreme sexual violence and the ISOYG films associated with IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) indicate that it only attracts protesters. <br /> <br /> Finally, some critics have praised Zarchi's documentary style and lack of soundtrack. But considering the inept nature of the rest of the film (acting, screenplay, etc.), I suspect it was financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because it literally set up a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their work. <BR /> <br /> I'm not going to kneel over the content of ISOYG. I am all for exploitation / horror and love the bad video. In fact, I give this movie three stars only because it really pushes the envelope much further than some other movies. However, the film is also of poor quality and, after the rape, it is downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a series of shabby murders, mostly murderless and waiting for the credits to be recorded. <br /> <br /> It's probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s fan, but I'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not worth it not really his notorious reputation.
