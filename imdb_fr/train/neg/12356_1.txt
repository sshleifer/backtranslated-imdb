Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the film, but resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended to do, but I learned that in the military, women are as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight, and it's also a waste of time (in my opinion). And, anyway, what was this ultimate scene in Libya? Do they still fight Gadafi or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always a danger?
