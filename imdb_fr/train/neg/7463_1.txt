It's been a long time since I promised to NEVER, NEVER watch a movie that featured SOMEONE who was NEVER a regular member of the Saturday Night Live cast. I did not rent "Corky Romano" but my good manners forced me to watch it for half an hour. Then my good manners failed. Stupid, not funny. Tedious, not hilarious. Bad, not good. In summary, that's all I can say for this video.
