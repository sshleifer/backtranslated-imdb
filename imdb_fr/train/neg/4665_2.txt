I really wanted to love The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, contours of interesting characters, Ewan Macgregor in the all glorious. Unfortunately, I hated every minute. Greenaway was so seduced by the presentation of the film that for his benefit. I will not even get into Vivian Wu's epic game. <br /> <br /> You're distracted by the story with 4 billion teenage windows and a scroll calligraphy at the bottom of the screen showing the lyrics of the music in progress. It seems that he has lost sight of the presentation of the story and the elaboration of the plot, and that he got entangled in foo-foo decorations that have nothing to do with anything. It's as if you were presenting a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in a chintzy Hallint frame on which is written "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in large glittering letters. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a victim of the director's ego, instead of what it could have been - a disturbing and horribly beautiful beauty. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's better to limit yourself to art classes that take themselves too seriously.
