I can not believe they managed to spend 17 million US dollars for this movie. Dramatic acts, incredible scripts and effects that you could use on your PC, incredible conspiracies ... a journalist who can get an inexperienced flight attendant and who occupies an important position at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this film is so subtle that you come out as if they had tried to hit you in the head with a full size crucifix. All this film will do is preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at this ridiculous waste of money. If the filmmakers really wanted to convince people of Christianity and show what it means to believe sincerely, they would have used that money to help people who are really in need. Now, that could have led some people to listen to them.
