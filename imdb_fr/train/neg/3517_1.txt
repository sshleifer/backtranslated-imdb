I do not know who wrote the script for this film, but from the first moment, I was irritated. Of all the decisions they might make in the mountains, why do they make the most dangerous decision? Why do criminals act idiotically when they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? Why did not the main criminal land on the helicopter, shoot at Stallone, seize the money and take his flight hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I would give 5 points to this film for a nice action and beautiful landscapes, but because of the illogical behavior of the characters, I can just give 1 point to this film
