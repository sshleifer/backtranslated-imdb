Georgia Rule must be one of the - if not the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feeling that made me gasp, "what?" out loud at least 7 to 10 times during his two hours of grueling lessons. <br /> <br /> Announced in her trailer as a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as a matriarch, Felicity Huffman as a daughter and Lindsay Lohan as a rebel granddaughter, over-sexed and slightly dressed, the viewer thinks it will be a clich√©, a lightness, a film of chicks on growing up and get together as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about fake Advertising at worst. <br /> <br /> After many animal shots doing "funny" things in the background of "crucial" scenes and not to mention five minutes focusing on an old woman who goes to the doctor Once a week to change her diaper or the fact that this movie talks about Lindsay Lohan's character who was sexually abused by her stepfather, Georgia Rule creates her own kind of cinema: unfounded comedy, horribly shot, inappropriate and dealing with extremely serious topics in the most awkward, surreal and strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this film to be a drama or a comedy then he would have had to watch The Royal Tenenbaums. Next to. Junebug. Etc. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way for me to convince a reader to understand the awful nature of Georgia Rule is to create a hypothetical situation. Say the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, talks about the single main character because he was sexually assaulted as a child. But instead of the film taking a more dramatic turn, laughter and comedy would follow, all the reactions of the characters being those of fake, lifeless human beings, pretending to care. <br /> <br /> Add a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney, the flatter, nondimensional character who could have been completely eliminated from this poorly written writing, as well as a male character who throws all his beliefs and Moral to be with a too-tanned trashy girl who shares none of the same interests as him, as well as a scene of needless pursuit by car, unreal moments of characters trying to identify, and you have Georgia Rule. <br /> <br /> I found this film insulting to filmmakers, writers, actors, editors, etc. in trouble, who have a lot more talent and do not get noticed. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you must, you get drunk enough in advance.
