It was probably just my DVD --- but I would not recommend anyone trying to watch this picture on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to increase the volume of my TV at the highest level possible to hear about 80% of the dialogue. Part of the conversation remained under-audible. If you are Scottish, you may have a chance, even if it is thin. <br /> <br /> The voices of peoples are drowned in almost all ambient sounds, including the unfolding of a package, footprints and even smoking. <br /> <br /> Because the volume is high enough for the voices to be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes in a noisy environment, such as a disco. . And that you hurt yourself while diving so that the remote control lowers it. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in time of war, would meet international criteria to be described as atrocity. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour, I gave up, having seen nothing to buy the image.
