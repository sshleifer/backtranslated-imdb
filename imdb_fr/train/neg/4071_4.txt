A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother is imprisoned for complicity, but he escapes quickly. Escaping, the man, apparently innocent, kidnaps three victims and soon, he hires his girlfriend in the plot. If that was not enough, the situation deteriorated rapidly. <br /> <br /> This film had positive aspects and many negative aspects. Her strongest appearance was lead actress Emily Haack. Putting aside the fact that she is naked in a good part of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason why she can not live this experience and make it a career. I was convinced she was a ruthless person. <br /> <br /> The directors of this film were also very daring and flawless. Graphic nudity (male and female), coprophagia and extreme anal sex are not immune. I like my horror movies pushing the limits a bit, and this one totally ignored them, jumping to Gomorra. It may have been too much, but I think they realized what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now, the negative aspects. First and foremost, this film has a very low budget and the quality of the film shows it well. I can not apologize - the plot was decent, the acting was ok, and in some scenes the inferior movie made the movie more disturbing (more realistic feeling). So, I will not reprimand them for having low level equipment. What I'm going to blame them is the use of bad shots. For no reason can I check (in addition to plumping the movie), there is a large amount of footage from a graveyard. I do not really know why, and frankly, I started getting drowsy at that time because it was so long and useless. <br /> <br /> I also disagree with the title. The idea here was to trick people into believing that this movie had a connection to the classic "I Spit on Your Grave". Now, there is a line that seems to imply that the main character is the woman's daughter of this other movie. And the themes are very much the same (a woman taking revenge on men). But there is no solid link and the reason this title was chosen is that the video store customer thinks he's going to have a sequel. It was misleading and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last major complaint is that this plot makes no sense. Not even a little. A woman is killed at the beginning without reason. A prison escapee finds time to abduct people to torture them for no reason (because they hurt his girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to very bad without explanation. Similarly, the female role (Haack) turns from a normal person to an excessively cruel and sadistic person, for no reason, and against people who, for the most part, were only a little mean to her (a neighbor who offers drugs for evil, but in no way is it worth it to be tortured for.) <br /> <br /> Do not let this title fool you, nor pretend that the movie is incredibly shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the film is dull and makes you want to take a nap. If you see it in the video store or on Netflix, keep browsing. Or rent it and you can sit for hours. You were warned.
