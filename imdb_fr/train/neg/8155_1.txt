In fact, I prefer Robin Williams in his most serious roles (eg, Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World After Garp). These are my favorite Robin Williams movies. But although played well, Seize the Day is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> Every good story is going to have its ups and downs. This film, however, is a giant down. I do not need a nice Hollywood cheese festival, but I must have something other than 90 minutes of total despair. This film reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only purpose of the film is to see how far a person can fall. The answer? We do not care.
