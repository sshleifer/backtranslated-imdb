What a terrible movie! For some reason, science labs and outposts still have a team of dirty, dirty and petty misanthropists living there. These people who are likely working together on complex science projects do not seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a CGI dragon. Spoilers: An extra-evil scientist whose main acting skill is "peeping" and "sinister gaze" has cloned a dragon. While the lab was supposed to be working on these things, the other scientists are shocked because apparently they were all behind in their experiments and had their heads in the air. The rest of the story is like THE THING, or Ten Little Indians, where staff are chased and killed while trying to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the "Dragon". The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most CGI special effects. It does not look like a cartoon, and dark gray tones prevent you from seeing interesting details in the Dragon's body. All that looks like is a gray drop. The acting is less than horrible. These scientists act as a group of children who can not agree on anything, which allows the Dragon to kill them more easily during various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than one of the unknown actors this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his support cast. This movie is really, really atrocious. The acting is bad. The story is stupid. The CGI is very very cheap and amateurish. This film is not commendable, it is not even a killer of time to watch while doing housework or other work.
