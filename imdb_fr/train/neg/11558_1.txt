Extremely horrible tale that I can hardly say with words. The best part of the film was when one of the victims of the murder was at the end, alive and well, and then slaughtered again. It is possible that I missed crucial elements of the plot, since I may have fallen into a mild coma during the time this baby was alive. The box in which the film is shown shows scenes that never appear in the film. I was drawn to the crude images of torture through slavery and the promises of a "sexy horror film". I think it was the budget version and about a quarter of the film was left out. All good things more than likely. I had the PG-13 addition that was about as meaningful as the end of the new movie "Planet of the Apes". Look at this one with a friend and a bottle of hard stuff. You will need it.
