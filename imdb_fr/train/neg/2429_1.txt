Scary .. yes scary !! Surrounded by nudity (fat people to skinny people), Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in Santa Cruz. <br /> I saw this film for the first time two years ago. We can say that it is a strange subject. discussion at school the next day. This movie was horrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This film reached its climax with one of the new-age characters that remains between the legs of a girl. <br /> <br /> Girl: You're not going to find God here! Guy: Nah, but I think I found paradise. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this one, unless you want to hear amateur actors discussing topics such as farting, adultery and the process of overlaying the genitals. TO AVOID!
