My comment concerns the Russian version of Space Race named Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) aired on the first Russian channel on April 10 and 13, 2006. A bad translation could have ruined some details, but I doubt that this is the case . The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to enumerate them, especially during the first episode (the development of the first missiles). Even the American half of the movie contains multiple errors and omissions. The hearing is unaware of US V-2 / A-4 launches. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same "EU" serial number on board. Apollo 1 must be launched on the Moon, etc. In the Russian half, every person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of the NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and a traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic, etc. no motivation, no life at all. The uniform and the decorations are awful. Gagarin is singing a frivolous song awaiting launch (I think this has been added especially for the Russian version).
