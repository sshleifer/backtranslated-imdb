This film is the perfect illustration of how NOT to make a sci-fi movie. The worst trend of science fiction is to make your theme a horrible, sophomoric, pseudo-Orwellian / huxleyian / "whatever" vision of the "human future". <br /> <br /> Filmmakers (and writers) of science fiction, as geeks, take themselves very seriously considering the high relationship between their genre and that of shit. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just invent, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem a little better understand the fact that they do not change not the world in a deep way "message." <br /> <br /> As proven by many great filmmakers, science fiction can certainly succeed. However, the concept as a whole presents a huge disadvantage, represented by "Robot Jox", with its low-rent construction of "the future" (only design element: strange and smooth billboard ads that encourage women to have more babies) and its painfully painful parallels "Iliad" (It's named ACHILLES FOR DIE'S SAKE!) In fact, I did not pick it up before seeing the movie as ten times later, but I went to so filmmakers are not exempt.) <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're a cinematic maniac, like me, this disadvantage has a huge advantage. I absolutely love movies like this, because bad movies are often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. I guess it's a kind of Lester Bangs approach to watching movies. <br /> <br /> Note: The main role in this film (Gary Graham is his name? I refuse to check.) It's really not that bad. . He's doing. It's pretty cool, especially when it's drunk / hangover.
