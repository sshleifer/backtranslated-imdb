It started badly, got worse, and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end, I literally wanted to bring the DVD to the person we borrowed it from and smother it to death. To avoid this film, some good cinematography and nude shots, would be almost acceptable if I was 14 years old and had not seen Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If anyone feels the need to watch this film, I strongly recommend that you spend your time more appropriately. For example, I would say that trying to put a Lego home in your buttocks without lubricant would be a good start. I heard that this movie was not the original version, I would love to see the original, because it seems that this cut version contains no plot and, apparently, most of the nudity, someone can he tell me how I can get in touch with Christian Viel, he owes me an hour of my life!
