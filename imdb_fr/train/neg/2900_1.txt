I have a 5 minute rule (I sometimes leave 10 minutes). If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes, it's probably not going to get better. I have never experienced a film that challenges this theory. Dan in real life is certainly no exception. I looked at this turkey and thought; wow, it's not funny, not touching, not sad, and I do not like any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The story of a counselor / widower columnist raising three young girls who falls in love with his girlfriend brothers. I guess the slogan would be "columnist of tips that could use tips"? I do not know. The character of Dans did not seem to me to be qualified to advise. I guess that's irony? I do not know. He goes to see his parents, his brothers, his sisters and their children during a kind of annual family retreat that seems very sweet and could be used as a fodder for a good comedy, a story ... without ever leaving it. The central story is basically the way he loves this woman, but can not have it. Anyone who has a pulse will realize that he will eventually get it, but you will have to undergo a dialogue with the network of filmmaker "murderer of love" painfully tasteless, banal and lifetime to come to the inevitable happy ending . <br /> <br /> This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
