Well, without Ethel Waters and a seven-year-old Sammy Davis (presented here without the Jr.), Rufus Jones as president would be one of the worst depictions of African-American stereotypes seen since the beginning of the era of talkie and would not have been worth seeing because of that. Ms. Waters is excellent here singing "Am I Blue?" and "Underneath Our Harlem Moon" while Mr. Davis shows us how his showbiz youth experience prepared him for his superstar status as an adult. He's doing so many taps here that for a moment I thought he was a little person with decades of experience. So, if you're ready to ignore the negative connotations, Rufus Jones, president, should give you pleasure. P.S. This is the fourth time today that I have seen and heard the song "I'll be happy when you're dead, Rascal You," played on the film, this time by Davis. Must have been a very popular song at that time.
