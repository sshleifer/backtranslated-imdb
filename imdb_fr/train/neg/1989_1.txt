I would have liked to give this film a zero but it was not an option! This film is bad !!! Women can not act. I should have known that it was going to be bad when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe that I had not changed channels after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as gunmen in Western times is ridiculous. it's not just a matter of race, it's also a genre. the combination of both things is ridiculous.I am sorry because some people in the movie are not bad actors / actresses but the movie itself was awful. it was not credible as a movie. it could be 'entertaining' for a certain group of people but I am not in this group. lol. and using an excellent film from an excellent film ... "that's all I have to say about it."
