I gave this movie a high score of 2 stars, as I see it personally in the minutes 42 and 43 of the movie .... the scene of the street bars in Russia. In this scene, the director of the film gave me the immortal line - "50 dollars ... Drink and talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak with a Russian accent more convincing than I could. talking party on. I was a little starstruck because it was my first movie experience ... and who knows ... these lines could have resulted in lines such as "I'll be back" and "Frankly, my dear, I do not Do not worry about it "If I had mentioned this line, my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminum under the name" Heavy 1 "instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> </ br> > As time goes by, I'm lucky that my name has no connection to this film. <br /> <br /> Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in Barry Island, point hot from South Wales, no one could tell me what the script was, the caterers and the wardrobe all agreed that there seemed to be a lot of swearing and nudity ... things would have been worse if I had finished naked in this dreadful movie .... Always ..... On the positive side .... I was chatting with Rhys Ifans during a break I did not know who he was, because "Notting Hill" had not been released yet, and I did not think he could be Welsh. Has made various inappropriate comments on the terrible Barry Island pit since my visit in my childhood in the 70s and 80s. Only when Keith Allen arrived did I realize that I was in a quality production .. ......
