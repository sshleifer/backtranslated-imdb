Looking at it, it was like a big mackerel was slapping your face over and over again. Even when you thought: "This mackerel can not surely come back", "slap *". I'm not sure what they thought. This is the kind of pilot I watched and questioned: "Did the actors know they were on a death-row ship destined to never be turned into a series?" Not only black stereotypes, but also Swedish and Indian. And while "Blazing Saddles" turned these stereotypes into a mixture of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were simply offensive. There was no plot, the end was slapped, and the jokes are not. Nevertheless, if you are a student in comedy, watch this pilot to see what you should not do.
