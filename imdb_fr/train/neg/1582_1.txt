argh! this film hurts my head. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's just my growing hate for the kind of action, but even as a child, when I swallowed gut like Navy Seals, I always watched this movie with aversion. Now, I despise it completely. <br /> <br /> Take a pretty good fast paced story. keep the title and throw away the rest. instead, use a half-baked scenario of future gladiators, which is full of stuff that may collapse (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras? clearly marked what really happened to bakersfeild in an unguarded room? <br /> <br /> All the film screams the eighties, from Truley's score to the frightening defeat going through the brilliant costumes. ugh. <br /> <br /> do not watch this movie. I know some people liked it, but some people still get pissed on and I do not understand them either.
