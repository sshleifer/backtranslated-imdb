"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino plays a detective looking for a killer shooting arrows at people. Mira has an Italian accent that flickers from time to time. Could not she just speak English? All other characters have a Mexican \ Forced accent that is awkward. The dialogue is very bad and the delivery is wood. Cinematography looks good, but it's not enough to save this tripe. THIS NEXT PART OF THIS EXAMINATION CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> During the height of the crime, it seems that the villain will escape, but then he goes down the stairs to get shot and make a nice waterfall on the ramp. It just shows that this script has no originality. TO AVOID!
