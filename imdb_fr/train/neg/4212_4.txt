The beginning of this film is excellent with a great sound and a nice sense of humor, but once the film turns into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> that the colors in a large part of the animation are too dull and contrasted. It does not look good, at least on VHS. From time to time, it bursts and looks great, but not often. In addition, the characters come and go too fast. For example, I would have liked to see more "Moby Dick". When the film begins to slide, however, it resumes with the entry of the dragon and the film ends loud. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not memorable enough nor able to compete with the big animated films of the last twelve years.
