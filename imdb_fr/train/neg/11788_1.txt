It was one of the worst movies of all time !!!!!!!! It was so bad that I laughed through the movie ENTIER! The plot was so old; especially the end. This film goes from the disaster of end of the world to save the eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use SUP PUPPETS for eels! And there was this horrible kissing scene in the middle with the two main divorced characters. How predictable! It was so horrible that my mother, my sister and I could not finish it, and when we finished it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and finished, this time we made comments similar to those of MST3K throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Summary: Watch this only if you are a movie lover! Make hilarious comments, watch this during a slumber party for laughs, and I mean a lot of laughter. Watch out for teasing too. The metaphor that explains this film: This film is a very shallow field filled with cheese puppets and socks!
