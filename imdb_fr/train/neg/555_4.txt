The film is quite confusing and ridiculous. The plot is awful ... but on the positive side, the acting is pretty good, with some good cries and diatribes. Sharon Stone is OK this time ... not even half as good as the original spirit. The murders are not as bloody as the first one either, which is a shame. It's not the unpredictable mess that everyone says is good. The sex is sometimes quite graphic while others it is clear that it is false (they are fully clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the scenes with jokes and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are strong moments. The plot turns a few times, but the end is terrible. The tension is still constant with a big spoonful of "Oh my god!" The chase sequences are brilliantly directed. Shots and angles are impressive and bring class to an otherwise sensational movie. Sharon Stone is a bit old for that too. The bits where we see her breasts were, in the first, delights. This time, they are too horrible to be described. The film itself is rather average, but it is worth it. Mainly because the film deserves a good buzz ... with the opening sequence being a highlight. Do not be critical, but if you liked first, leave this one. Do not ruin the race. You will be happy to have left this stone unturned.
