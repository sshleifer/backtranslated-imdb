Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would turn in their graves if they knew that this person who dined at the Rip Off dinner was actually in the theaters. With Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with the masterpiece of director Stanley Kramer, published in 1967. This scam these days is a joke. For example, a Rhode Island White from a stereotypical Italian family brings his African-American girlfriend home (insert GASP here) to his grandfather's funeral. The reactions of his family members were of course ... predictable. This film was so painfully telegraphed from beginning to end that my girlfriend had started to simulate snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Take a pass on Wake.
