When HE ARNOLD! went on the air in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes began to be watched over and over again, so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching. I was a little surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE, because it does not seem to be as popular as some other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Nevertheless, having nothing better to do, I still went to see the film. Going to the theater, I did not expect much. I just expected it to be a silly version of the children's cartoon, like the movie RECESS. I guess I got what I expected. It was a silly movie for kids and nothing more. There were some good roles here and there, but for the most part, the movie was a whore. Just for the kids.
