It is obvious that all the good reviews published for this film come from initiates who participated in the film or who know someone who knows someone and who have thus suffered several cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I saw the final cup, and that's pure hogwash. The ambition and multiple cameos of legends of horror are at the rendezvous (none on the screen for a terribly long duration). It's as if the filmmakers had made this film a weekend at a horror convention and had forced actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks. X-Files is an ultra-cheap and highly filmed film, with a dreadful acting game composed of non-actors with more mules than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; it is an explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain an unnecessarily complicated plot. The computer effects are a joke, but they are not numerous enough, not enough action to make this movie enjoyable in MST3K mode. After about 8 consecutive scenes without saying anything but talking, you find yourself reaching the button fast forward ... and not letting yourself go. Absolutely worthless.
