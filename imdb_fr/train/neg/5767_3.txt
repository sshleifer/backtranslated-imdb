As said before, the visual effects are stunning. They are breathtaking. Personally, I use Blender and such graphics are not easy at all. But that's all this movie is. Not only is the plot puzzling, but the conflict in general is unclear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo try to escape who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the bottomless pit room, Proog will explain that "a step out of place and (you're dead)". Here there is a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that a conflict exists between man and nature. But suddenly, a conflict exists between man and man when Proog, out of nowhere, murders Emo. Proog immediately stops being a caring guardian caring for a lost child in a "sick man". He betrays us. Not only is it depressing, but we do not care because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character is not developed. This is not a story about someone who, through a struggle, comes out stronger. It is depressing and uninteresting because there is no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light as a great drama does. In my opinion, the film is seriously underdeveloped in all its aspects. However, the graphics are breathtaking, but a movie is more than just a feast for the eyes. There is no truth, no struggle and a bad surprise that ends. In conclusion, an underdeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
