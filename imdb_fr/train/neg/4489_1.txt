`The Matrix 'was an exciting summer blockbuster, both visually stunning and curiously thought-provoking in the manner of Twilight Zone. The general rule applies here - and this sequence does not correspond to its predecessor. Worse than that, it does not even compare to that. <br /> <br /> "Reloaded" explodes on the screen in the least professional way. In the first few seconds, the first impression is usually good since Trinity is filmed in a dream. Immediately after, the film plunges into the nose. After a disastrous 45-minute debut, he gradually gains momentum as they enter the matrix and Agent Smith's battle takes place. But he loses all speed when he reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and worsens in the end. The worst of all is the very long `Zion Rave 'scene. Not only does this have absolutely nothing to do with intrigue, but it is also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dances. <br /> <br /> The bullet aspect of "The Matrix" was a good addition, but in "Reloaded", they abuse it to make it seem boring. In the first, there were interesting turns, but here it is too linear to be interesting at a distance. The film is basically just a series of elegant hijinks that prevent us from realizing how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that the bigger it is, the better. It seems that the `The Matrix 'franchise has quickly entered the special effects dump than other franchises like the Star Wars saga. <br /> <br /> The acting standard is mediocre for the most part. Of course, the best character is Hugo Weaving's "Agent Smith" - the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all special effects, there is little room for much impact. Laurence Fishburne, an Oscar nominee, is reduced to a monotonous mentor and mediocre dialogue. The role of Carrie Ann Moss as a woman of action could have been much better done by another actress. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Matrix Reloaded" is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first are unlikely to go there. This one is reserved for hardcore fans. Even in the subgenre of the film, that of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix, etc.), it remains rather mediocre. My rating IMDb: 4.5 / 10.
