Killer Tomatoes's films have that kind of special humor - whether you like it or hate it. Personally, I like it, but in this fourth film, the feeling is gone. The tomatoes are not the same, the jokes are lame, even the actors are not so funny. Because that's the only thing this kind of movies is supposed to be - funny. <br /> <br /> So, now, to follow the plot made to laugh is annoying. They really should not have done the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
