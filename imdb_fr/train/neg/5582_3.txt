The 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheavals and unrest were commonplace when people expressed their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity and drug abuse were all part of everyday fabric and daily news. This film has attempted to summarize these historical aspects in an entertaining film and has largely succeeded. <br /> <br /> In this film, two families are followed: one white and one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on an equal footing, through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. Certainly, there are more characters in this family and stories are mingled, but the racial aspects of this century are not taken into account in the same way. <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting is well done and historical. The footage is mixed with original color and black-and-white footage to give the film a documentary feel. The film is a fictional work, but excerpts from well-known historical figures are used to set the timeline. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie, but the situations were predictable and the scenario was one way.
