When I was in school, I made a film about a couple wandering in the trees and talking, and I realized in the middle of editing that it was not a failed aesthetic strategy, but a cliché of cinema Canadian: the sodden lyricism married to a vacant metaphor. burdens to social comment. But whatever the failures of my own movie, I feel much better after seeing this ... thing .... On one hand, mine lasted 20 minutes, not 85 minutes, and contained more content: all useless tasks are treated for four, five or six minutes relentlessly. The main male role is simply incredible. It is an incursion into dramatic theater between two philosophical ideas collected in a pub at the University of Toronto. We give him a lot of space to make us hate him. Certainly, if it were not such a ** hole, the third act would make even less sense, since a couple of sneaky guys came forward to provide distant echoes and totally useless values ​​of "exploitation" ; but it's not easier to take a closer look at the roaring cages "please" until the magazine runs out. I repeat what I said about AUTUMN BORN, who at least had the courage of his own dishonest lust: this crater is and will remain the worst Canadian film of all time. At least, I really hope so.
