::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Too bad, Arnie is really a good guy, but after an incident with helicopter fights and disobedience to orders, he was sent to jail (or rather labor camp). He escapes, but soon after, he is caught. This time ends in a freakish reality TV show in which he is supposed to run for a while with a group of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie and we all know he's harder than the beefiest. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie, be a fan of Arnie and so on. However, "The Running Man" contains too many faults that really bother me. For example. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is presented with a brief summary of the incident, complete with 5 to 10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with nearly 10 cameras filming crew members, one of which is under the eye of one of Arnie's crew members. <br /> <br /> There are also other flaws, and the plot, which seems theoretically very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then creates a sort of basin of stupidity and unrealism in which she is drowning. <br /> <br /> The acting game can not really be considered anything better than below average, with Arnie in the lead role, performing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast is doing it without being particularly good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are acceptable without being impressive. <br /> <br /> NOTE: 3/10
