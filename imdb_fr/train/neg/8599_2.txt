is a seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. Thus, in this regard, the average IMDb vote is accurate. <br /> <br /> A Spanish film shot in the United States with third or fourth category actors giving a kind of "Falcon Crest" to the whole affair is a marvel to waste your time, as well as the money from those who supported the project financially. <br /> <br /> The slugs are originals from Asturias, northern Spain, but have not been allowed to enter the United States. the plastics had to be made. However, cutting them into lettuce used to make the evening salad contrasts singularly with Parisian music and with a rather paltry array of other forgotten US successes (or failures if you do not know who is responsible for its composition. )). The actors involved were also a rather faded band, just fine for a low-budget movie, which could be described as horrible, horrible, horrible or just horrible. <br /> <br /> As a result, the result is negligible the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as the 17,000 chapter of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad.
