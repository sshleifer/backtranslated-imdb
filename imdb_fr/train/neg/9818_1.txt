This film raises a number of pressing issues in my mind. First, how did Jennifer Tilly manage to maintain a film actress career for all those years on the basis of that ridiculous grumpy voice and the very limited range of vivid facial expressions she uses? Secondly ... what are the people responsible for the thought of this offensive and deeply disgusting film? And thirdly ... since there were people who were perverse enough to decide to act as if nothing had happened, there should not be anyone in the system - the studio, the distributors or somewhere - Sane enough to prevent him from ending and going out. . It really would take a very long way to mount another movie as nasty as that ... and it's not even presented as a horror movie - which, as far as it can be seen as belonging to a movie Legitimate kind of movie, it's certainly. The film slides from end to end in the sickest form of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features. In fact, I do not advocate censorship (which I do not believe) ... but I really do not see how anyone could derive anything positive from a film like this.
