This film was a puzzling garbage. You never knew what was happening. The characters were badly written and for the most part they were totally unfriendly except for Gus (played masterfully by George Eads). I hate this film but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse), he should have won a prize from the academy. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and old-fashioned film. All your life, you have fallen into a new depression. Someone needs to make sure this director never works in movies again. It was also supposed to be a horror movie because it was so much funnier than scary. For shame for life, for shame.
