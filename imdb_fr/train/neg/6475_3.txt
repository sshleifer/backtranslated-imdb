Although I have not seen the film again in about two years, I can remember exactly why my opinion has remained so low. Having loved the original little mermaid and having been obsessed with mermaids since her childhood, I decided to take the time to sit down and watch the rest. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you do not have the director and the original actors at your fingertips ... you just want to make you jump. <br /> <br /> In the following, our story begins with a slightly older Ariel and her daughter, MÃ©lodie. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the team sang. Yes, I understand that Disney loves singing and dancing, but that's what made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected and a true gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did it. DO NOT. SUNG. <br /> <br /> And then there is the bad guy. Oh, how could we forget the shivers that roamed our thorns every time Ursula stuck to the screen, terrifying both Ariel and audiences around the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not passed on to his seemingly useless sister, Morgana. Nothing has ever been, never said about Morgana in the first film; she comes out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh how cute. The younger sister is checked and, instead of attacking the trident, decides to take a baby away for a month. Gag me. <br /> <br /> Other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her, Morgana was just very unorthodox. The same plan as his sister, the same henchmen (who, by the way, did not scare anyone.) I had a child of three years on my lap when I watched this film and she laughed hysterically. had no purpose to be there; I would have liked to see mom being the bad guy. I'm sure she would have done a better job than Little Miss Tish over there. <br /> <br /> King Triton had no respect for the respect he had deserved in the first film, and he did not even get me started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a stern but loving father in the first film, and in the second, he almost lost the will to sow fear in the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comical relief that made everyone laugh with his "dingle-hopper" (yes, I'll admit it, I called my fork a dingle-hopper from time to time afterwards). In this film, Scuttle is almost forgotten. A support character even in the first, he at least added something to the movie. He was rich in a flavor that the others did not have, and afterwards they took it away entirely. Sebastian was always the same, but twice as disturbing as before. Disney, do not do that. Do not even try to play with our favorite crab. Or our little favorite fatty fish, who becomes dad and has a lot of very annoying kids. He is fat, and he is bland, and he seems to be going on the straight line. <br /> <br /> The walrus and the penguin were no longer necessary, and after a while, we start to blame everyone. Especially Melody, who has no depth for her. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I do not care about my life. <br /> <br /> If I did not like your originals so much.
