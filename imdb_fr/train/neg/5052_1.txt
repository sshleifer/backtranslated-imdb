The peloton is at the Vietnam War as Rocky IV at boxing heavyweight championships. Oliver Stone's account of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it is laughable. Even though most or all of the platoon events occurred during the 10 years of US military engagement in Vietnam, describe what happens to a small group of men in such a short time (weeks) gives an image horribly distorted war. In the peloton, the platoon men see everything in a week or two: American soldiers murdering civilians, American soldiers raping civilians, an American sergeant murdering another American sergeant, a private individual murdering a sergeant US staff, US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, 90% + dead or injured in the squad. For Stone, trying to portray this film as the typical American soldier experience in Vietnam is a shame. We recommend two Vietnam War movies, We Were Soldiers (the true story of the worst battle for American soldiers in Vietnam), and A Bright Shining Lie of HBO.
