This film was based on real facts? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We are lucky to see what appears to be many armed cops emptying an equal amount of firearms against 2 guys who only have the armored torso. It's a good idea; aim the armor! ... excuse me, but what about those big, unmistakable heads or their legs for shouting loudly? Or were there invisible tanks protecting them? Have I forgotten something here? <br /> <br /> This film started quite decently, but after 20 minutes of shooting, you really have to turn your back on Boringlane. <br /> <br /> And this style of documentary did not work either, but it's just something that we find nice or not. <br /> <br /> Extremely incredible content that makes it difficult to see it through. <br /> 3/10 for fine retouching.
