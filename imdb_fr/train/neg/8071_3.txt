I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she only has a small part and her character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and is a delight to watch throughout the film. It's really just a showcase for his appearance and talent. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is, at first sight, quite absurd. After a car accident, some friends may have died, but continue to live their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things are happening. Some villains are looking for them, but we never really find out who they are (maybe they were in the other car, but we certainly do not hear why they are looking for them). The final scenes seem particularly ambitious, but I can not get anything coherent. The opening scene, where the wicked (who wear strange masks) cut the wrist of a blonde girl and recover some of his blood is never explained or followed. Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who are trying to remove Cassie (Sagemiller) from the dead ... but no, that does not seem to work. The wicked are only wicked; they only spoil a story that would otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death, love and sacrifice, who on earth needs villains? <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
