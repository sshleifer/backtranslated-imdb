From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I witnessed it in my media studies course, and I recognized the lead actress. So I tried, despite critics criticism. Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling, Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt Bully), a cool boy, team up to murder a girl at random to challenge themselves and see if they can shoot without the police finding them. Detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) and her new partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are quite confused by the evidence found on the scene, are investigating the murder, for example. unrelated hair. The plan does not seem to go completely well because Cassie and Sam have pretty quickly Richard or Justin as suspects, it is simply a question of whether they can dismiss them. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's rope with murder for a challenge, but this movie does it in a very silly way, and even a good reasonably good Bullock can not save it from being dull and predictable. Adequate!
