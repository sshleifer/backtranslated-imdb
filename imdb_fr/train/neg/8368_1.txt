When you look at a little man, you will spend his time trying to understand his many holes in the plot. And that's not a good sign because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! You're supposed to laugh !! But do you want? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the little man is his concept. It's too ridiculous to accept (even as a caricature comedy). It seems ten times stupider than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy", some of you could shout. That's right, but it's not an excuse for such a stupid plot. I mean, think about it if you saw a baby with A COLD MANS FACE, would not you be the least suspicious? And if Calvin wanted so much to hide the diamond, why did not he place it on a shelf near the bag rather than in a random purse? And how can a qualified physician NOT recognize that Calvin is an adult man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about laughter," you might be screaming. You see, there is almost no laughter in the little man and this makes the silly plot more blatant. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a Wayans brethren comedy with a suspenseful plot, stick to the white girls, because at least that gave you some decent laughs.
