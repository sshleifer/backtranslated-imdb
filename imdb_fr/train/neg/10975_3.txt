This film is blowing - let's get right to the point now. There are some scenes of gems nestled in this pile of shit but none can redeem the lifeless plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts the same way. I normally hate Colin because it's a fairy in general, but he's fine in this movie. There were two intrigues in this film - one about a child throwing stones through the windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it: this movie has no frightening idea of ​​what it meant or where it wanted to go. The characters' stories mingle at certain levels but do not deserve to be included in a script. Everything is weak and useless and then there is an occasional OK scene. But all in all, do not bother unless you like the Irish accents to the point of being able to look mediocrity and that everyone can save it, looking like the lucky elf - an American fetish who catapulted some really nil movies.
