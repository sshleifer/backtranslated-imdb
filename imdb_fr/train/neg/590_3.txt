Unfortunately, this film disappointed me because it felt wrong and the characters were not strong enough to carry the film in a rather low horror attempt. The basic idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately, I could not excite, nor scare or shock me - there was a part in the whole film that I found horrible but that it did not buy. I really liked Kate's character at the end of the movie because she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic at the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really necessary for this movie and I think the director / writer I got carried away by the multitude of characters used on purpose, if he had left it as a simple effort of solo effort of Kate, it might have worked - Jeremy's game was wooden for the less and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on the chemistry of the screen - or lack thereof. What a pity. Disappointing.
