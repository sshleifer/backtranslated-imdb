There is a lot of talk of torture these days. That's all this movie is. This is a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From that moment, it's a kick for him. I do not know when you are doing something. There is a woman and a child somewhere; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there should have been times when he could have acted. The film seems to be a joke. I suppose that after the murders of Manson, we got a little attached to these two. Nevertheless, why would anyone make such a movie? What calls has he except for sadism. The conclusion is totally unsatisfactory, but it could have been corrected with an obvious plot reversal. Never mind. An hour and a half of my life.
