I went to see this one with a lot of expectations. Unfortunately, the dialogue is completely stupid and on the whole, the film is far from arousing admiration or interest. Even a child can see the logic that is missing from the character's behaviors. Today's children need creative stories that inspire them and make them "dream" about events. This is precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars ten years ago. (How many children did they imagine becoming Jedi Knights and light their own lightsaber?) Do not waste your time and money with that.
