I did not really know what the film was about when I went to the theater to see it (hype about Satanism, etc., etc.), because the trailers of the last movie I saw were rather interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh my God, Catholic mythology? This is not my idea of ​​a good scare and honestly, I just want to watch a very good scary movie, not a grossly plot-like religious farce that tries to chill around cheaply by making sure that Babe is bleeding every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from the detractors (!), But I found it very strange that an atheist, who receives a rosary from a deceased priest, can suddenly find with the wounds of Christ (are not supposed to be stigmata to be deeply religious ??) I mean, she hangs out with losers, does she do things for the losers, behaves like a typical rebel and others, and presents it by displaying the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on! <br /> <br /> Scenes of his crucified, head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, have become rather boring after seeing him a dozen times. It was neither scary nor scary, just disgusting. However, it became very painful to watch - these dazzling scenes were very boring ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If you are Catholic, do not see it. If you are not, do not still see it.
