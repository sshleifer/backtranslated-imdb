I read the book and really enjoyed it from start to finish. However, when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. First, no disrespect towards Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a 24/25 woman. The late Christopher Reeve was also the victim of a bad reason. According to the book, Will would be around 30 years old. I would love to see his friend Red, his friend Red, Elly's trip to see him, because it was an important part of the development of the characters' story. Miss Beasley was also mistaken, the book mentioning that she was a tall woman. I know the film did not have the Bridges Of Madison County budget, which I believe was published about the same time. <br /> <br /> But, for me, this film was poorly built and poorly constructed. As someone mentioned, I'd like Miss Spenser to come out of retirement and write scripts for her books, as she should. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope she will consider casting too. The film dropped me!
