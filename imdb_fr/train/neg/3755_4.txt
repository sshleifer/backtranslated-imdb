I loved this movie, I'll admit it. It must be the best (directly to?) Movie that I saw. Well ... my friend and I decided, for shitty reasons, to rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, more. When this Sasquatch hit the red tree against the tree, we literally watched this part three or four times, it was also amazing (hysterical, of course). And why? Oh, why should the main character roll so much? Honestly, we know you're in danger, rolling so much is not going to help you much. But really, if this movie is in, you rent it. It's worth it and it's not even bad, like it's bad, but not bad. Overall, you will be delighted if you rent this movie.
