This film disgusted me. No, it's not because of the graphic sex scenes, it's because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film does not contain much truth about her and her art. She shows a work of art she made (Judith Beheading Holofernese) but shows that she was registered as a witness at the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you understood that in the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He REMEDIES Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to have accepted false rape charges to prevent him from suffering while tortured. According to the transcripts of the rape, he continued to claim that he had never known Artemisia (that is, he had sex with her) while she kept saying, "C ' is right". <br /> <br /> and discover the true Artemisia and see what she's really talking about. Do not base all your knowledge on this fiction film. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind her and amazing artwork. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, but discover the true story of Artemisia.
