It's an awful movie. Yes girls are pretty but it's not very good. The plot involving a cowboy to get in touch with an Indian girl would be interesting if sex did not prevent it. Okay, that may be interesting, but it is not, because it is so poorly trained and has only partially acted. I can only imagine what the close-ups of dancers on a big screen look like, probably more laughable than they are on TV. (I will not even mention the stab-knife fight between two women who are tied to each other and who pass the whole bazaar - never read about it in the Old West) This is a movie that requires a liberal use of Fast Forward technology. <Br /> <br /> I like schlock movies but that's ridiculous. There is a reason why I do not go in this kind of movies and they tend not to be very good, the plot taking the back seat. The original nudie creations, as they are called, were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching, but as the adult industry grew, filmmakers were trying to to be smart, to exploit something else in order to place asses in the seats. The most intelligent were very few, leaving only hacks of limited talent. The comedies have often behaved better with a humor approaching the first level, infantile but fun without a doubt. Something we can rarely say about another kind of group, disguised as a nudie. <br /> <br /> The Ramrodder looks good and contains some nice songs, but it's over because it's not a western movie or a sex movie. <Br /> <br /> I do not need to watch this anymore. <br /> <br /> The rapist and the murderer in the film did not arouse the interest of anyone, but it was interpreted by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a little teacher long after shooting the film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this kind of thing will ruin the lives of some people.
