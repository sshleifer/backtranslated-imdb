Seeing all the negative reviews for this movie, I thought it might be another cartoon masterpiece that was not really supposed to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the wild dialogue provided terribly by Lungren, and all the other Eastern actors cast, and I found the movie so awful that it was funny. Then, Brandon Lee enters the story and the one-liners begin to fly, the plot falls apart, the writers begin to drink and the film is exhausted, because it turns into the worst action movie of all time . <br /> <br /> Lungren's previous efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as in all of Van Damme's films, Seagal's films and non-rock films by Stallone, are honored for this honor. This film has the worst role (see the face of Tia Carrere when she plays any scene with Dolph, it's worth laughing), with the worst dialogue of all time (the commentary of Brandon Lee on the small Dolph is the worst line of all time in a movie), and the worst outfit of a movie (Dolph in Japanese outfit). Picture "Tango and Cash" with a less well-done acting game, meeting "Commando", "Friday the 13th" (because of the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance very similar to that of Jason Voorhees), in a joke of one hour and fifteen minutes film. <br /> <br /> The good performances (that to say not terrific performances) go to the villain (who always looks constipated throughout his performance) and to Carrere (who somehow says his 5 lines without burst out laughing). Brandon Lee is Lungren's team mate and does a really awful job in this regard. <br /> <br /> A horrible and awful film. Fear him and avoid him. If you look at it, ask yourself why underwater photos are twice as clear as most non-submarine photos. Speaking of underwater shooting, take a look at the lame water fight scene with the worst scenario of all time. This film contains all versions of a bad fight scene for those with limited attention span and to fill the gap between nudity splinters. <br /> <br /> A WRONG BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
