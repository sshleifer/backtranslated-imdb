It is a hideous little production, likely to give a nightmare as well as headaches. It's an ugly mix of live action and lousy stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun and strange trip that any optimist can expect. It's the odd kind, cold, inhumane, hostile, disgusting, even scary. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did things much more attractive with stop-motion. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it reinforces the stereotype that the French have no notion of scary.
