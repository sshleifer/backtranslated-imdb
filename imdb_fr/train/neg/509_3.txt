This film talks about British prisoners of war from World War II escaped from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find the wooden horse disappointing. The subject could have been exciting, full of suspense and fueled by adrenaline, but "The wooden horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple and badly told events, without suspension or thrill. The first part clearly tells how prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so clear, with not enough blunders and shaves up close to get me on the alert. The last part of the movie is even worse, they just go from one place to another without hunting cat and mouse. And the characters could talk a little less and have more action in an action movie! I am disappointed with "The Wooden Horse", he lost all his potential to become a great movie.
