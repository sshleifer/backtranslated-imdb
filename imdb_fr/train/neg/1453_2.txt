I'm not sure whether it's the language or the mediocre actors' game, but everything in this movie seems to be cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang, it's a huge disappointment. There is no link between different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor that I could not even believe that people could do so much damage with something that had huge potential. <br /> <br /> And most importantly, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems like a collection of random events that would have could arrive. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've already seen Der Untergang, everything in this movie was fake and ridiculous.
