The only reason I did not get this result is that Sibrel shows that he is an expert on the technical aspects of making a movie. It's a technically clever film. <br /> <br /> That said, it is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily refutable. Most of the documentary is devoted to the use of propaganda techniques to criticize the space program, rather than the facts. And Sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that landings have been falsified is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, watch it for free on Google Video. Do not let Bart Sibrel enjoy your curiosity.
