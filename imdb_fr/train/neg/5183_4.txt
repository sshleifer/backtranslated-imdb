This is the first in this "8 Movies To Die For" collection that I've seen and it certainly did not make me want to see the rest ... although I've heard at least some decent ones . I do not know, it was not terrible but it did not really help me much. Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in the suburbs, mom and dad passed away, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?) Where they continued to bring home sources of lost food whenever possible. The best part of this was Goth's scary sister, who of course invites a school friend who never leaves. In any case, of course, we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on. This family is a bit like the white bread version of the Sawyer clan, they are mean and they do bad things but they do not go without soul. I see a lot of reviews from people who liked it, and I guess I do not know what I missed, but I found it very mediocre and I would not recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10
