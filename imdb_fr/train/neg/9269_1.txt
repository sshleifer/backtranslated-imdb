Well, since I've seen parts 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they should NEVER have done part 4. Everything from mediocre, and I'm only talking about the poor score in the very bad game. actor, I challenge anyone to look at this and not be bored of their minds. <br /> <br /> I mean parts 1 to 3 have kept the mood strong in Damion's plot, but without him in this scene, it's just not the same thing. Of course, at the end of the third part, I was getting a little tired of following the story, but it was a good close at the end of the third. Again, there was no reason for part 4. Even if there were, they could have done MUCH better work than this one, but I had to sit, lol. I have an hour and a half left in my life that I will never see again.
