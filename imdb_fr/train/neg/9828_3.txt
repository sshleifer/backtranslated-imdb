I rented this by mistake. After a cursory review of the box, I thought it was a story of time travel / science fiction. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I guess is a pretty typical example. If you are sold on the message, you will probably forget the inconvenience of the plot / acting / etc, but I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the rewriting of history in this story bothers me. It depicts the 1890s as a sort of paradise of family values ​​and morality (5% of marriages end in divorce!), But it neglects very unpleasant aspects of this "very moral" society (rigid, racial, sexual society and politics). social discrimination was widespread, for example). And at one point, the hero complains to a clothing store owner of things that do not look so different from those of some Iranian leaders regarding women's dress styles (reported in a recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> Overall, thought, I guess that's the kind of thing you'll like if you like that kind of thing, and it's certainly healthy ...
