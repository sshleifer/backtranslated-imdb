Belmondo is a hard cop. He attacks a big drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, normally a big bad guy - see "Sharky's Machine", but here he is clearly doubled and because of that, he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the noisiest places in Paris and Marseilles, asks for names, beats people, gets names, goes to fuzzier places, asks for more names, beats more people, and so on. The whole movie is one movie at a time. after punch. It seems that creators have ambition only to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 years old here, performs good stunts early; Apart from these, "The Marginal" is a violent crime film, episodic, banal, superficial and forgettable. (* 1/2)
