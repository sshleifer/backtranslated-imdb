I remember when that came out, a lot of kids were nuts about it. I guess I was a little too old to be all excited and that I was a fan of real martial arts movies and that I always found it a bit cheesy. <br /> <br /> In the early 1990s, we were overwhelmed by programs like this. to make sure that the children have the impression of being able to fight and become a powerful ranger or equal to these children on 3 Ninjas. I think that finally parents and filmmakers have had enough because we really only had a lot of kids hitting and hitting everybody. <br /> <br /> Many children's movies have a lot to say. and it's nice for your children to watch and receive the message, it does not contain any message ... it operates a million different things in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film has no great visual qualities but can we expect it? The acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here. The adorable little big fat, gaping look like a powerful ninja who was just hilarious. The children have acted too much and the youngest ninja, Tum Tum, is perhaps the worst actor I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has a plot that everyone knows even before reading the review. 3 ninjas ... yes, you know that they will fight a group of villains and obviously win ... I have to say more. Sorry if I spoiled it for anyone. <br /> <br /> With all that I have just said, children will love it. This film is for children and only children can enjoy it. If you do not mind your child seeing movies about children fighting, it's a good movie to let them see. If you allow your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, a real theatrical or real period, then you have found a movie for your kids ... I tell the kids because I think even girls will do it. I like ... I remember all the girls who had a crush on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 stars out of 10 because I think you can create a movie for kids while making it enjoyable for adults .. this movie This has gone beyond the limits of cheese and has nothing original or original and I would not allow one of my kids to watch it ... Kung Fu, the TV series is on DVD and there are tons of great movies from Shaw Brothers. ..Why not show your kids things that will really keep them entertained and not make them idiotic along the way, maybe even teach them how to move and not kick a man like he did Grandpa 3 Ninjas ... no no no ... never kicks between the legs of a man ... never ... it's so unninja like.
