This movie is so horrible. So bad that I can not bear to spend anything but a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes are reproduced correctly. Many slaughterhouse sequences. Weird cuts and modifications. No continuity in the plot. The acting game is absolutely the most amateur I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film bomb was obviously designed to make money without worrying about the accuracy of its content. The work of the camera is sometimes blurry and always fragile. Looks like the film was shot on a video. <br /> <br /> In fact, now that Dennis Rader has been sentenced to life imprisonment, I wish they also put in jail the guys who made this horrible film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think about looking at this one. I would give him a negative star if I could.
