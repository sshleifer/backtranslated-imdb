Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted culinary critic whose dominant and flamboyant mother settles with her. JJ, appalled by this turn of events, then makes the restaurant owner, Alex, sing to entertain his mother in exchange for "maybe" revising her dying restaurant. As expected, Alex falls in love with his daughter while addressing his mother. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are universally in 2 dimensions. JJ is a selfish and hateful character, his superficial and superficial mother. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are both boys and opportunists. The underlying message of a woman over 50 unable to cope alone, without the help of a man, is bad, bad, bad. The acting game is uniformly boring, the script uninspired. The only thing that saves movies is the decor of New York City. I would NOT recommend this movie.
