I just rented this today ... heard a lot of good reviews in advance. SENSATIONAL!! What a pile of smoking poo this movie is !! Does anyone know the manager's address so that I can get back my five dollars? Finally, someone has screwed up "Stop-Loss" of the number one "Worst Iraq War Movie Ever". To be honest, I do not think there are any good films about the war in Iraq, but it was REALLY bad. <br /> <br /> I will not go into technical inaccuracies, there are a hundred critics of other veterinarians of the GWOT who detail them all. If the director took the trouble to consult the most modest E-Nothing on the technical precision, he could have made the film a little realistic ... maybe. I imagine that the author should receive the "credit" for this waste of film. He or she obviously drew the plot for this film from a vivid imagination not afflicted with the constraints of reality. Does anyone other than me wonder what is the point of this film? Was there a message? Seriously, ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am really surprised by all the positive reviews. This film is hard to watch as a veterinarian because of all the blatant inaccuracies, but even if we could forget that, the plot is nil, the characters are superficial (to say the least) and the Actor play is at best mediocre. It's ironic, I suppose, that this film is supposed to be dedicated to the destruction of explosive ordinances, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
