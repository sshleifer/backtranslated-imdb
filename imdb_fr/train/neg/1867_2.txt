Unfortunately, the only drawback of this review is that there is nothing to ruin in this movie. Although B. Mattei never made a masterpiece with which he did his job with a touch of humor and madness, which made him a fun director for Eurotrash. This film is simply empty, nothing awakens us from the deep sleep in which you sink after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (it's supposed to be about snuff?), No actors, no dialogue, as bad as a 90'TV movie. It's even worse than its last epics of cannibals and zombies.So rest in peace Bruno, you will always stay in our minds, thanks to such unforgettable gems as: Zombie 3, Robowar, Rats, altro inferno, Virus, cruel jaws and some others.So unless you Want to see B Mattei possessed by the new film of the spirit of Jess Franco, pass this one. But if you do not do it I do not know the career of this good craftsman to find his old movies and have fun.
