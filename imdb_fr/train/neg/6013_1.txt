I have read all the books so far from the series left behind, and the film hardly does them justice. Of course, I saw worse movies, but it was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good episode of MST3K. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it seemed that the actors were reading their lines instead of saying them. The characters were stiff and improbable. The effects were tacky and looked terribly wrong. The end was terrible. First of all, he did not even go through the first book. Second, it made no sense. If you had not read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. It must have been the most cheesy ending, that of a film student I have never seen in a movie. I am sorry to have paid money for this film. If miraculously, it is widely circulated, they should revise it completely and let Hollywood take over. These two budding film producers and the budding director should leave the film to the professionals.
