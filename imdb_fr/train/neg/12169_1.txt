It is an immoral and reprehensible trash, which probably wants to be a clone of Friday the 13th (1980). The poster in this film suggests that there will be some sort of cross between Jason and Freddy, which will probably attract the audience. There is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie. It just makes me sad to think that some people will stumble on video or DVD on Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers (1988) and waste their time with this sad, cynical and depressing movie. <br /> <br /> Angela Baker (Pamela Springsteen) is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills. She hopes the other campers are as nice as she is and do not worry about trouble. Meanwhile, other campers realize that people are disappearing one by one. Angela invents the excuse to send him home. Could Angela be the killer, who was once a man, who underwent a sex change operation years ago? Who knows? We do not care? <br /> <br /> The 1980s were the scene of many movies that made the crossover genres Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager, in which a crazy killer goes crazy. Some have a plot, some do not, but they are all as bad as this one. Sleepaway Camp II: Unfortunate campers, it's 80 minutes of teenagers who are then introduced, stabbed, strangled, impaled, cut, burned alive and mutilated. That's all this movie is. It's just blinding and bloody violence. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I remembered Friday the 13th, where the message to its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to get hacked to death. The filmmakers of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed of themselves. Imagine the clumsy message this film offers to its teenage viewers: "The world is a totally evil place," this movie tells you, "and it will kill you, no matter what your dreams or hopes are. new boyfriend or girlfriend No matter what you think, what you do or what your future plans are, you can forget about these projects because you're just going to end up dead. "<br /> </ br> > And the sickest thing is - and by not revealing too much - the film simply sets up a sequel. Well, why not? They probably have already carried the bucket into the cesspool by making three or four of these films. I missed the original camp Sleepaway (1983) and, after watching his first suite, I hope to stay away from the other suites, as well as from the original. And for parents, if you know kids who really LOVE this movie, do not let them out with your kids.
