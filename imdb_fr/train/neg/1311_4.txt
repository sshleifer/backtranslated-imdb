Jerry spies on Tom listening to a scary story on the radio and takes the opportunity to scare his sworn enemy. <br /> <br /> I did not find this episode as funny as this: the humor seemed rather constrained and all a little lame (Jerry is essentially the "bad guy" in this one, tormenting the poor Tom for no particular reason). <br /> <br /> There is a flash of casual inspiration (like the literal experience of Tom's "heart in the mouth" and the moment his nine lives are sucked out of his body), but in the together, this effort lacks the frantic stimulation, excellent animation, and pure spirit of most other T & J cartoons.
