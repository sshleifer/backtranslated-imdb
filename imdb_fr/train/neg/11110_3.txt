I just wish we knew that I do not often rate movies below 5. I was very excited originally to see this movie. His many trailer on TV for several months gave me REALLY want to see this movie. So the other night, I saw that he was available on FearNet on Demand, I took some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The story has seemed rather intriguing - a guy is slaughtering unsuspecting people on the subway. There is a photographer obsessed with missing persons. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher who follows him, yada yada. The movie had a way to suck you, even if the plot was very predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look behind you," I say, quite bored by the cheap thrills. <br /> <br /> The plot, even if predictable, was intriguing ... that is to say until the end. "It was good until the end ... Then it became silly," says Jack_skellington_freke on the bulletin boards. And I totally agree. And here are the detractors ... <br /> <br /> You see, I was hoping it was a crazy killer, a psychotic obsessed with cannibalism. It was a secret society that kept creatures alive for centuries. Courting. How original It's unrealistic. How dull. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Go Lionsgate. You had incredible movies, but this one sank.
