THE TEMP (1993) did not have much to do with theater, but here's the video scam you did not want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new wife of Millennium Investments, a large brokerage firm, who is starting to receive useful advice from the wide-eyed secretary, Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious girl for dad who will stop at nothing to climb the ladder of the company, including kissing one of the best brokers she does not support and murdering all those who fall apart. She unearths skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause trouble to her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills by giving the impression that she is responsible, abducts her daughter and tries to get her to divert from her business money. <br /> Harris and Kelley offer competent performances, the support cast is correct and reasonably well assembled, but that does not completely compensate for a scenario following a well-trodden path with few surprises.
