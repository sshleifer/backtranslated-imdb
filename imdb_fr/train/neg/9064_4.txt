In fact, Broadway's adaptation of Broadway's "Threepenny" was not as "mainstream" as commonly thought. <br /> <br /> (I have a special interest in "Threepenny", my father was part of the first The University of Illllois Theater Guild did it at the end of the Second World War.HJitler had succeeded in removing the piece that had had to reconstruct the scenario and partition from records in two different languages ​​{nor English}, German script and similar sources). The adaptation of Blitzstein - and not a "translation" - approved by Lotte Lenya - was much closer to the original than we thought. <br /> <br /> is that his version that most people are familiar with is the recording of the MGM cast (recently available on Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur {as Lucy, "the complete grand daughter ", and I can not see his hands on hips and shoulders thrown back on this line - Bea was a major girl in the 50s, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was heavily censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Records - I mean, 17 years old (I think it was) "Fuck, we only have" fucking ". <br /> MGM also offered a set of 2 discs of the whole * piece, probably also strongly censored.)
