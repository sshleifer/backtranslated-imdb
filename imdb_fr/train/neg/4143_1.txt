As myself and my other half are big fans of Trash Horror, we could not help but release a movie containing the two big names that delighted us! However, for a 2004 film with a cover of Freddy against Jason, it's a shame! The worst movie I have ever seen, but it's worth a laugh if you get to sit! <br /> <br /> The acting is awful, although I can do better on my camcorder it's so serious that they only bothered to put on the faces of zombies and on the neck, hands, etc. No intrigue, weird flashbacks that make no sense and a terrible scenario! "A vampire" you broke my cigar "was the answer of the man who looked like Dukes Uncle Jessie crossed with Santa Claus!
