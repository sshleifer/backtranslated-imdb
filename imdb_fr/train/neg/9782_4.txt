This movie had such a promise !! What a good idea, an oppressed paintball team fighting for recognition and personal glory only loses its speed because of poor dialogue, poor editing and a half-written story. At first, the characters were interesting, but halfway through, they lost speed and became one-dimensional characters that crackled on tense lines. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spent more time on history and dialogue, was a good movie, instead of an effort almost after reflection.
