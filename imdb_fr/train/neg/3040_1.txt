With a title like this, you know that you get a lot of junk food. Act badly. The script is bad. Bad director. Grammar bad. <br /> <br /> The movie makes a lot of noise that really no music and a lot of people are screaming. Movie make a bad racial stereotype. Why are all movies with a black hero addicted to drugs? Why do heroes always have to dance to succeed? Why does a famous rapper always have to be in a dance movie? Why come letter "s" can not be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood must stop the dumb audience and make a movie that have brains that can speak English properly. <br /> <br /> Indulge yourself and do not go see.
