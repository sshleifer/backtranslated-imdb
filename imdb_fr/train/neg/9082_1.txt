This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was cheated thinking it might be fine because some of my favorite actors are there. Now, I want to hit Jason Schwartzman in the face for playing that role. I was physically sick after watching this movie. I do not really understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to break in that I'm sure you can escape the top and get the best. In this way, the worst film you make is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this mud. The gags like the hair doll and the blatant wrenching of the advertisements on the jeans added to the humor of the film. I'm glad I avoided this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid January publications at any cost.
