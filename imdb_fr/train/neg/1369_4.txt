Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of 1930s gangster movies made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton portrays a middle-aged gangster who looks back on his life with blows when he catches a child stealing something from his pet shop in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has persistent health problems. young age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord with Boyle and Keaton eventually climbs into the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious twist as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned attorney, Glynnis O'Connor, his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton. The film is notoriously cheap, making it look like a TV show rather than a theatrical movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogues and gags, the film keeps going during the first half, but then quickly loses steam and plunges into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the landscape making his best impression of James Cagney. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only unpleasant, not funny. Piscopo does the "once" bit once too much. Several supporting actors try to keep the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as office sergeant and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous housekeeper. The second half evolves into a hit-or-miss TV-style tone and never recovers. The final scene using The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, as is the movie The Call Of The Wild, Clark Gable, seen under a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, because the target audience would certainly be aware of the actual release date of The Roaring Twenties in 1939. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
