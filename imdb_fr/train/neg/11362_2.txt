"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated film I've seen in a long time. That said something since I took my son to see all the animated outings of the last 4 years. The story is to be generous ... banal. The dubbing is atrocious, too cute. Humor is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon type drawing, but it is broadcast on the big screen and not on cable TV. <br /> <br /> The object of the 2 is only obtained thanks to its correct 3D graphics. Some scenes had a slightly stimulating image, but we have seen much better in the past. I also wonder about the filmmakers' insistence that the characters fly away rather than inward in most scenes. Although it was interesting at first, it became tedious after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to me indifferent on the part of the creators. <br /> <br /> I will say this, however, the soundtrack was pretty cool. And for the record, my son was not too crazy about it either. Bad movie.
