I'm looking at it now in pink (TV channel Serbia) and I must say it's a shit. Shallow, no action, too sloppy effects, I mean, who made this series? <br /> <br /> It was a stupid attempt by the studios to make more money on the movie's success. OKAY. The movie was awesome in 1994 when it came out. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how silly the lines are in the characters' speech. I mean, did they really pay someone to write this, was it someone close to the Studio? It's not a science fiction. <br /> <br /> The film was the bomb, the series is nil.
