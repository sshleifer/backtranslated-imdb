To base a television series on the works of a popular author is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire television learned the hard way when, in 1979, they bought the rights to the works credited to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title "The Racing Game". Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey turned private following an accident in which he lost his right hand, but replaced it with an artificial hand. Gwilym was suffering from a glaring lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys) while Mick Ford (who played the irritating Chico Barnes) reminded me of a horse's ass every time he was at home. screen. For six weeks, this less than dynamic duo attacked the countryside, foiling infamous conspiracies to repair the ordeals, usually by the same methods: blackmail, kidnapping riders or doping horses. Yorkshire television threw money at the show, but to no avail. Violent, sexist, far-fetched and repetitive, he was quickly transported to the burglars' yard.
