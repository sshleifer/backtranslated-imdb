The fighting scenes play as idle Jackie Chan and the spirit attempts are pathetic (worst pun play by far: "Guess what? This time, I heard you coming"). The stars are a mismatched couple: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible words he said, actually shows traces of charisma and charm on the screen - things that Dolph Lundgren is totally free (at least in this film ). Note to the director: In the future, avoid love scenes, especially if your main actress is not naked and you have to rely a lot on a double of the body. (* 1/2)
