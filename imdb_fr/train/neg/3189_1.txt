I guess that proves that Joe Don Baker will do everything for his money. The concept of the movie was not very good to start. This movie has so many bad things about it, I do not know where to start. The acting is horrible. Cinematography is at best marginal. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There is a reason why this film ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before writing this and I can not believe that 9 people actually think that this "film" is excellent. They had to like both go-go dancers. The final justice would be if they locked this boat in the safe of the movie outside Wichita and never let anyone see him again! A score of 1 in 10 is far superior to what it deserves.
