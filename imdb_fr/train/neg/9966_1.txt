Although I never like being the kind of person who denies the personal taste of another; if you like something, that's fine. But, this movie was horrible and there is no way to get around it. I do not really like Ani Difranco, but I can admit she is an excellent guitarist and composer. But I can not admit that this film has redeeming qualities. Many people think this is an accurate description of the issues facing high school students. Maybe, but everything is described too exaggerated. There seems to be an attempt at "Naked Gun" - comic genre, but the timing is wrong; there is too much space between each line of actors, as if they were standing to laugh (there was none). Whoever wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to bring together so many controversial topics in the same film, almost never developing any of them (especially the girl being impregnated by a teacher). I did not laugh once in all this movie. I was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes on the screen.
