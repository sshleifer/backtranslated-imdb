I did not know if I laughed or cried when I saw that. Only fans who are addicted to danni crust might like it. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's just dirt. The coolest scene is the car crash, with real special effects from the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See this only for studies of the gravity of a film ................
