The film had nice aspects. Maybe too much for my taste. It was as if the screenwriter / director was desperately trying to make us feel the inner conflict of ALL his characters. Not once, sometimes ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> It's the work of television, not cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the station was well chosen and I appreciated the performance of Sascha Horler as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt like Justine Clarke's performance was wan. Her reactions to things were forced, as if the director was trying to formulate the themes of the film through the expressions of her protagonist. I can not believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the choice of pop music slapped on whole sequences. It's a lazy device, especially when the pop music does not come from any diagetic place for the movie and / or the lyrics of the song are embarrassing. <br /> <br /> That said, the quality of the film evokes the warmth and local attitude of Australia with originality. This creates an atmosphere of warmth and sun. Especially with the use of wonderful animation sequences that save the film of total mediocrity, infusing it with passion and craft charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious why the dialogue is so overwhelmed. "Who knows if there is a god, like a guy sitting in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line. <br /> <br /> One of the most embarrassing moments is perhaps the friend returning from cricket with a bouquet of flowers to declare to his wife "I quit smoking." <br /> <br /> An anti-tobacco advertisement? A TAC ad with a tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema in the 50th minute - it was too much.
