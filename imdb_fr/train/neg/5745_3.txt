This film was awarded the Academy's Best Animated Short Film Award in 1990. In recent weeks, I have seen dozens of nominees and recipients of this award over the past 30 years and I have really think that this movie might be the worst of them. Yet it was not just a nominee. won!! I guess 1989 must be a horrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The film presents a group of characters that look a little like super-skinny Uncle Festers. They seem to be simple articulated characters that are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical - with the same faces, body and clothes. The only difference is that everyone has a different number drawn on their backs. They all stand on a large platform suspended, as if by magic, in space. Everyone has a pole and theirs is also a box on the platform. The platform begins to tilt slightly and, in response, the men move in the effort to balance the platform. It continues over and over again and again and again for a very long time. The only relief from this boredom is that one of them is pretty mean at the end, but it's not enough to make it fun to watch in the least. Apart from the passable animation in stop motion, this short film does not interest me in anything .... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, the beautiful short KNICK KNACK was also released in 1989 and I do not know why. was not one of the nominees. It was a very good short film and was much better than all the nominees this year or the year before. Maybe Pixar's success in previous years has resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so smart and funny that it seems almost criminal to have ignored him. Could not Pixar have entered? This seems unlikely.
