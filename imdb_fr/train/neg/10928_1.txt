I just saw this movie and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. These are basically the bad Mormon news that play church sanctioned basketball. Rather than watching this film, I should have had a root canal. The performance of the cameo was obviously motivated by sponsorship / funding. This film had potential because of the scandalous behavior of Mormons when playing church sanctioned basketball. However, since he is PG rated, the true nature of the show can not be transferred to the film. The game is horrible except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in the movie was totally useless.
