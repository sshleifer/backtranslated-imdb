Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying and lonely old fool who lives at Morhenge Mansion with servants and says to his friend doctor: "Do not try to cure me, doctor, I'm in very bad health!" He invites his nephews and nieces to his home and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by "shrinking the brain" (?) <br /> <br /> ** * SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff eventually dies, and deadly "toys" (designed by his dead brother) begin to kill loved ones. A mini-gun fires real bullets at a guy's face, a knight in full-size armor attacks with an ax and a dancing sheik stabs people with a knife. A strangled guy makes hilarious faces. In the end, Julissa and her boyfriend discover that Karloff is still alive and hides in the dungeon where steel doors seal the room. He plays recurring music on the theme of the organ (a kind of death rattle used for murder), the brother's spirit begins to speak ("The whole house will follow me!") And the mansion burns . <br /> <br /> This crazy mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.
