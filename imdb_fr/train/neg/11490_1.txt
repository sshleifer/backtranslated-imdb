I agree with most people's opinion that this series was poorly produced and written. The game of actors was not much higher than the lower production values, but I believe that an actor can only rely on the material provided to him and make the most of it. . In keeping with this idea, I think it's important to point out that one actor stood up and persevered beyond this breathtaking production to become bland and become a respectable and highly talented performer. I'm talking about Laura Harris, a Canadian-born actor who has made her way through a lot of badly-produced series and films to find a spot on the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where she plays Daisy Adair and her credit, she manages this role effectively.I remember having had the typical crush of my childhood I felt as if someone could "succeed" in this series it would surely be Laura Harris and, true to her nature, she has excelled in the acting game. field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent and her unique northern blonde look. If you ever have the opportunity to see this series, I recommend you have something epic to watch after episodes like the "Godfather" or maybe "Beaches" to remind you that there is ultimately a great integrity of production This series is just a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply say about her time in the series and I bet she would quote the many defense lyrics young actors saying "it's a start!"
