The scenario is absurd and lame, performance and dialogue are hard to keep your eyes open. I advise you to have a friend powered by caffeine on hand to wake you in time for some effects of Gore. Why do they bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes more and more difficult to swallow. During all this time, I wondered who was targeted by this film? A bunch of lame sub-intrigues (like the captain of the US Army Cannibalism) It's a low rank in all aspects.BTW this movie is forbidden in Germany !!
