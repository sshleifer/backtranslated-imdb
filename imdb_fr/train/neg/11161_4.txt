"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> With: Jack Black, Ana Reguera, Héctor Jiménez and Darius Rose <br /> > Evaluation of the MPAA: "PG-13" (for rough action and raw humor including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you want about it (I know people who despise it endlessly ), but I always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite" was a fun movie - not the brightest brick on the wall, but a fun movie, nonetheless. Jack Black is also a very funny man - irritating at times, yes, and overwhelmingly overestimated by an adolescent audience who almost loves him, but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not appreciate to a certain extent. So I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of "Napoleon Dynamite", and Jack Black would team up for a film about a Spanish brother who became a fighter to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my only booking turned out to be the fall of the entire movie. This plot, if it had been done as a sketch in a show like "Saturday Night Live" or maybe even "Mad TV", would have worked perfectly. Unfortunately, the plot is too thin after about an hour and a half and this comedy of a joke falls flat. <br /> <br /> Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devoted man of the Lord. Fleeing the monastery as a whole, Nacho (Black), now a cook at the monastery, decides to follow his dreams and become a professional wrestler. While the finances of the monastery reached their lowest level, Nacho decided to participate in a wrestling tournament in order to win the prize and provide quality food to the monastery's orphanage. This plot seems so sweet and caring. It sounds like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with "School of Rock" after all. Well, to my chagrin, this plot is almost completely ruined by a rude and offensive humor that takes all the meaning out of the heart of the film. It's another way to show Hollywood that they have the impression that the teen audience will only understand cat jokes and stupid humor - of course, it may be the general thinking of teenagers, because many seemed to enjoy this film. Watching an obese woman rush like a mouse on the floor will certainly make people laugh, but do not expect to receive a prize for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old girl could make the same joke. <br /> <br /> The performances in "Nacho Libre" are really good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he is able to make the most idiotic and worthless replicas comical. Unfortunately, this film was not enough for him. It did not give him anything to go on and the only reason his jokes worked was because of him. I have never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but I can now say that not only is she very talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to ever have graced my sight . She just clicked on the role and it worked perfectly. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Esqueleto, Nacho's boiling partner, made me laugh all the time. He did a very good job and he was very effective in partnership with Jack Black's. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did not have a lot of aftershocks, but what can I say, I just enjoyed it. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did its job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted in such a mediocre film. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" just does not work. His plot is much too thin. The heart of all this is stained by stupid humor and sickening jokes that just do not work. I rarely laughed and, if so, it was because of Jack Black or another cast member. And that brings me to the good side of "Nacho Libre": yes, distribution. This casting was just ?? Well, for want of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together and injected as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" entertained me throughout the movie, I was surprised to find myself so often bored by "Nacho Libre". Something has been lost here and I have not yet understood what it was. All I know is that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and yet, because of its distribution, it is worth absolutely nothing. There is a small reason to look, if only to look at Jack Black's work. But if you're not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie as a scourge. I love blacks, but this movie and this review are over. <br /> <br /> Final thought: yes! This is the surprisingly disappointing sequel to Jared Hess following his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite". <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 4/10 (C +)
