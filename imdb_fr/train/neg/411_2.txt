Normally, I do not really feel the interest of commenting on movies I do not like, but in a case like this, I just have to say something. This film is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many faults in the story that I do not even have to develop because it's time to move on. The most annoying point, however, is that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the reasons for Bacon's madness are due to a stroke or a physiological reaction to his condition. <br /> <br /> the effects are impressive, and Paul Verhoeven did a good job in the past (the Robocop DVD editing by the director is great). However, this film is stupid and can not usually explain the point or the technical aspect of the subject, but is content with a predictable action without any pleasure. <br /> <br /> In short, like many other critics say here (I would have liked to read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
