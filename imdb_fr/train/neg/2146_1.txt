I'm just going to say it here, it was the worst following a classic Disney film I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest movies of all time. Now, bring the right songs, add a mediocre plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. "Gather it and what do you get?" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After seeing this, I thought everything was over for Disney. Cinderella should have ended with "and they lived happily ever after." not this trash. This film did not deserve a sequel like this one. I thought it would be like "a twist in time" that was moderate but better than that. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? She changed sides like Iago, but that did not help anyone.
