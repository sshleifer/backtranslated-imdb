This movie was so badly written and realized that I fell asleep for 30 minutes. The jokes in the movie are nerdy and although the plot is interesting in some ways, it is too far-fetched and in some ways ridiculous. If you are 11 years old or older, you neglect writing the film and you will be disappointed, but if you are 10 years old or younger, it's a movie that will catch your attention and amaze you with all the stunts (which I could add, it's badly done) and wish you were a warrior to. The cast in this movie was not very good and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to create tension, but it did not stick at all. Brenda Song has talent in comedy, but with this kind of film, in some of the most serious scenes, her role was to play ridiculous. When she did some of her "fights", I laughed. I think the worst thing about this movie is undoubtedly the realization, for example, the part where his enemy turns out to be the person who owns the evil pervert, how his voice becomes dark and perverse, I think that c was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy's teachers (Brenda Song) were all her teachers at school, owned by monks, that was ridiculous. So, to sum it all up, a disappointing movie, but hey if you're 10 or younger.
