I watched the entire movie until the end ashamed even though I felt so angry at what I saw. I felt that the director was screaming for attention and that the only way to get there was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I live in the UK, I love this country, but this film describes the young British in the worst way. There is nothing to say but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. The people involved should be ashamed.
