SPOILERS HEREIN <br /> <br /> My high school has made every effort to motivate us to take the exams. But the most memorable method for putting us in a proper state of mind was a guest speaker, who was none other than the favorite son of Australian Kickboxing, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was to give this guy a microphone, because he was screaming half the time, even though we were not sitting more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now, his speech was filled with the usual "if you fail to prepare, so get ready to fail," but there have been several instances where I was really pissed off. The guy was standing in front of us, preaching how, throughout his life, he had done everything for himself and no one else. In the past, he had several offers to give up kick-boxing, but he never gave up the merit of becoming the biggest kickboxer in Australia. He said he was not a sold-out, he was happy and a retiree, he was never involved in any other activity than kickboxing? then he plugged in his movie. Yes, you heard right, he plugged in his new movie. While he was talking about it, he brought in a woman who was holding a poster that advertised it, and then showed this 4-minute clip of this vile film called "Trojan Warrior". (All this before he is defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his last career fight (at the moment)) <br /> <br /> Stan plays Ajax, an ex-special forces kick-boxing officer shot in the subterranean world of Melbourne. Ajax's cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel) was recently sold (well, at least Stan did not get too far from EVERYTHING) to the federal authorities and, as a result, is on the run from all layers of organized crime . Ajax and Theo find themselves in all kinds of ridiculous situations, whether it's fighting at a Kebab store or pretending to be a playboy at a bondage party. It's pretty ridiculous, but if Silverstein really wanted to make a credible movie here, this man should never get a camera again. <br /> <br /> I admit, I was pumped to see that. I love action movies, even if they are tacky, and especially if they take place in my own backyard. But what was presented to me was a film whose role was horrendous and continued after the words "for the sake of God, stop!", The secondary intrigues were introduced and are not even addressed. once again after their appearance, the characters were added for no reason, and the most choreographed battle scenes did not even reflect Stan's current Kickboxing talent. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by almost every VERY famous person (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews). All the time you sit and play the guessing game of just standing in the background. Too bad the film is largely based on appearances in the split second of former celebrities. Do you remember those intrigues I told you about? Ajax was once apparently locked up, wrongly accused of murdering his wife. Now, we learn that Ajax was in special forces via ONE sentence in the movie ENTIRE, and then we left it for sodomy. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence that persuades Ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up. So, understand, at the end, it is revealed to Ajax that his wife was not really dead, but had been sold for prostitution purposes. Do we see it? Will Ajax pick her up as soon as he hears this? No, now it's a wedding! <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this irritating and childish shit, a website has described this movie as "a cross between Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie ??". Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan movie ?! Chan shows more dexterity by taking a dump than Stan did ??, well, EVERYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the detective film Messiah, and you compare him to Salik Silverstein !? This film is rather a mix of "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja". <br /> <br /> Now, where do you think the whole title "Trojan Warrior" comes from? The fierce fighting techniques of Ajax like those of an ancient Greek warrior? No. The unification of gangsters to find Theo, like that of the Trojan empire? No, it's because ?? wait for that ?? Theo is wearing a condom with him. Yes, that's right, because THEO is ALWAYS PREPARED with a TRUE HORSE BRAND RUBBER in his pocket, he's a Trojan Warrior! <br /> <br /> I had the displeasure to see "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as its "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? Video clip of "Chop Chop", a rap song of Mark "Chopper" Read: Chopper did it for the sole purpose of proving that EVERYONE can rap. The funny thing was that Chopper hit for 30 seconds, then threw it at these two albino teenagers of Doncaster, using words such as "say" and "dope", etc. in their Australian accents. Face it people, rap was developed in the United States, leave it there! The clip looked like a Channel 31 ecstasy cameraman. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis Kick Boxing Featurette: It was not that bad, considering that it was only 6 or 7 different fights presented from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio falling about 15 times in this montage of 3 minutes). <BR/> <br /> I do not mean to say that this film contributes to the reason why this country goes to hell when it comes to filming, but ... oh, wait, I just did it. I advise anyone who reads this to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", stick them together and use them as a clipboard, because this movie is so bad.
