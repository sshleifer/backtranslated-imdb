I have read some good reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface", but for all uninitiated like Italian gangster movies like me, the picture will probably have no meaning. Indeed, after the initial setup involving the scam of ten million lire, the picture became a rather routine revenge movie with a minor twist in Rick's character identity (Al Cliver). Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli) has turned everything upside down in my gang war story, but as most other viewers have commented, he's pretty much the only one to have given this picture a life with his often violent attempts ineffective. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's henchmen who chased Tony through the streets did not pass by until Tony put his hand to them. Despite all his build-up as a main character, Jack Palance was wasted in a rather messy way in an almost anti-clash final, making the American title "Mr. Scarface" rather questionable. I've seen enough spaghetti westerns to know they do not all work; I guess in this case, my first look at a spaghetti gangster movie did not quite succeed.
