I guess it's possible that I've seen worse movies, but this one is a real whore! the plot is remarkable, but it's not the worst. the direction is far from what one would expect from andy ching. he is able to do a good job but failed to collect this film. <br /> <br /> angie harmon, playing the lead role in the role of journalist as a reporter seeking to determine who is behind the assassination of the president, has truly ravaged the role. there was no chemistry with the good, her behavior was flat and wooden, and the stilettos she wore throughout the film were absurd. this output to harmonize the place firmly at the bottom of the list "b". <br /> <br /> and what does cuba gooding think ??? he has to his credit a number of exceptional performances, but that was not what we expected from him. <br /> <br /> Poor James Woods and Burt Reynolds. poor poor poor poor.
