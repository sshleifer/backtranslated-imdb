"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" is one of the many movies of the 50s about teenagers in heat meeting the supernatural. In this case, teenagers can not pay rent for their meeting place and be evicted. Having nowhere to go, they opt for an apparently haunted house. As you may have guessed, once they arrive, strange things start to happen. And there is a twist at the end. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other movies, but it's still a nice entertainment. My favorite character was the jaw parrot. Well, let me rephrase that: he did not speak like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things that are not expected of a bird. The film is pure hokum, but harmless.
