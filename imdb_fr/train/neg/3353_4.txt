Pretty bad movie does not offer anything new. The usual squeaks and groans try to make up for a confusing, but thin story. To act is hardly more than pathetic. Why did Liam Neeson sign for this? Owen Wilson is truly one of the worst performers in the recent history of horror movies. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to watch and not much else, although Lili Tayor did a job above average. The special effects were quite memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and sublime. However, they can not wear makeup for mediocre acting and the scenario that seems to have been put in place at the last minute. Do not bother yourself.
