I would like to say that curiosity has had the best of me. If only I saw a trailer, I could tell you the whole plot of the film. I could have spared myself the most useless hours and forty minutes of my life and about twenty dollars. This film was an impending disaster and embarrassing for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film displays a deep ignorance of reality. For example, this child's remote-controlled race car travels through the neighborhood and enters the house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote control can no longer transmit a signal in these circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe it. The common logic and any concept of electronics dictate the opposite; I doubt that the race car could even reach the street, let alone a house in front. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence of criminals. Why in all these films, these criminals are rocket specialists until they meet an eight-year-old? The kid is supposed to be the smartest person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in The Matrix. In addition, the chief poses his real pistol and "accidentally" takes a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove, we should be able to do it. It's not because they look alike. there are other senses than sight. Traps are also unrealistic; if one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But Hollywood intends to make us "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a very bad film. the film they saw will look like Citizen Kane in relation to this one. Otherwise, skip this one for reasons of pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz in the film, but did he write it too?
