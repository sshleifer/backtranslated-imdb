Some things need to be clarified. The image of Mark Ferris is not that of Mark Ferris who played in this film. I know because he was my father. Please delete this image. Mark Ferris was also the author, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to review this movie. It had been years and if anyone could tell me how to get a copy, it would be great. The film was not so bad, and trying to compare it to the current world of Star Wars and other high tech sciences, it's futile. If you look at it, take advantage of it for the thoroughness and humor it has. Relax and watch less creative and innovative films.
