I can not describe how terrible this movie is. Am I the only one here who finds the way totally animated and disgusting? The Men of Rohan look 100% wrong with their poorly colored hair, it does not even match what the actors look like. The orcs seemed terrible. Why does Gandalf walk with bad lameness? Why can not they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others that sounded like a terrible pronunciation * sp * of Tolkien characters. All in all, I'm glad that the studio that did it unplugged the plug-in, it was just a terrible adaptation. Go watch the hobbit caricature for a better caricature of Tolkiens' work. Damn, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2/10
