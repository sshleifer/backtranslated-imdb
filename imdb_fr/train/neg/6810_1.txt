To be honest, I did not really like "Executive Decision" - which was obvious in the model - but compared to that piece of shit, it looks like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only that. people who move in the film (the term actors would be an insult to all other actors) should attend more drama classes, the guy who built the scenery did not even see a plane by far. It's so ridiculous that on a 747, there are only 3 flights, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicality (for example: use dormant gas, so do not use it, then use it anyway), which ultimately lowered my rating. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun by rearranging the sock drawer or by drilling a hole in the knee and filling it with milk.
