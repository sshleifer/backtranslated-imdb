"I went to the cinema to see 'Beat Street' / it was not bad, it was pretty cool / 'Krush Groove' was a movie, it did not bother me / but when it comes to 'Rappin' , I drew the line. "A word to your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? <br /> <br /> This is just a small sample of the rhymin style 'stupa-mouche' exposed in this mess of film and location permits. This movie is really great (it's only 80 years old, it's just awful). As a master of ceremonies, Mario Van Peebles is an actor hell. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a bodybuilder hell. <br /> <br /> Any movie calling itself "Rappin '" would be better off delivering at the highest level of this genre at the time. So why did 6-year-olds enter the aisles, even when the standards were so low that they reached "Webster"? Because this rap is weak. So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a chain of 10 meters of gold rope. <br /> <br /> "Rapture" by Blondie is a flawless poetry next to this Dr. Suess piece in the hood. So do not be silly, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
