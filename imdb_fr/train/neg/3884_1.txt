There are many moons when I was seven, I vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this film. This drew my na√Øve curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being wise adults they are, they told me: "Absolutely not! It's a pile of garbage." Of course, I was very disappointed not to be the first child of my age to see "The Incredible Melting Man". <br /> <br /> Little time has passed - maybe a few days. I forgot "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment faded. Twenty-five years went by until he returned to the forefront of my thoughts. While surfing on digital cable channels, I found this long lost movie relic. My curiosity was piqued and I decided to finally participate in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. "The Incredible Melting Man" is perhaps the worst film known to man. This gives the impression that films such as "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" look like Oscar nominees. I feel violated for having lost almost two hours of my life watching this filth. The story was incoherent and the effects raw even in 1977. How did someone convince a production company to produce this film beyond me? <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me: listen to your parents if they forbid you to watch this movie. They were right.
