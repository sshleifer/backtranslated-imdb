I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and shot apart !! It was not funny at all. The audience remained seated throughout the film and did not laugh at all !!! Even the kids did not laugh !! It's sad for a Disney movie !! I thought they could have found someone better to play Martian than Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid !! And he was not funny !! I thought the suit was talking was really stupid !!! In the original television series, the costume does not speak and does not move !! In my opinion, they should not have lost their time with this movie !! I give him two inches !! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the film to anyone !!! Thank you!!
