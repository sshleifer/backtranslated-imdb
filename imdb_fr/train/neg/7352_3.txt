It was not funny in 1972. It's not funny now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I do not denigrate the film because it is incredibly sexist - I quote what I liked, or rather I appreciated the reaction it provokes in annoying PC people - I blame him because he is poorly written and misunderstood. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable character is Blakey, whom the 25-year-old Britons will immediately recognize has long been a favorite of the Impressionists. <br /> <br /> To avoid. <br /> <br />
