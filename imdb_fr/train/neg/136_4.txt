*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do all teen slasher films suffer from a drought of originality? This seems terribly true. First of all, it's a noble premise that could have been used well. A rejected young nerd who grows up, hounds and murders all the girls who tortured him to hell when he was in college? You can not say that you had nothing to work. But this film follows the same movements as all other recent slashers. Everything from score to camera angles allows us to predict exactly when a false alarm will happen and when the killer will hit. We know the pattern now. These stupid slasher movies are pushing the envelope of credibility more and more. Let me ask you one question: who in their minds will surprise one of their friends in a dark and gloomy morgue in the middle of the night and surprise her from nowhere when she is all alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make any sense? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only rarely innovative. A good move is to skin the character of Denise Richards. She is trapped in a pool and the killer strikes her with a chainsaw. There are some good songs in the soundtrack, including a nice piece of Orgy. The music video is contained in the Special Features section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the acting game is mediocre at best. The actors sleep all through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his role as the main character in "Angel". Denise Richards is a good actress and keeps her face in the movie. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is what you expect: pretentious, implausible, forgettable, cheesy and without fear. view. Do not even bother. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
