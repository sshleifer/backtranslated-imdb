According to IMDb, as well as for any other website that contains a review; this "thing" has no director. Well, that would surely explain a lot! Just a group of people who have come together to shoot kinky pornographic footage and tell an ultra-thin story about devil worship and women's sacrifices in the walls of an isolated sanatorium. "Hardgore" is a great example of a totally crazy 1970s coal, because it is really manufactured with a minimum of production values ​​and script inspiration. Horror movies about satanic cults were extremely popular in the early 70's and pornography too, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a nymphomaniac girl who has been entrusted to a psychiatric asylum and who, from the first night, is drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rapes, torture and dildos. Really, LOTS of dildo action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to prevent her, but she gets her throat cut the same night. The aspects of horror are really poorly developed, from ridiculously insignificant Satan masks to virulent attacks of severed penises. The photographic and theatrical performances are almost intolerably amateurish, but what do you expect from a movie that presents images of dildos that shoot sperm and talking reproductive organs amputated? Star performer Justina Lynn is a pretty girl with a lovely body, but most of her co-stars (men and women) are hideous and excessively hairy sleaze balls.
