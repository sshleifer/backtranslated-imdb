Robert Taylor was clearly an excellent drama actor in his role as a bomb buffalo hunter in this 1956 western. It was one of the few times that Taylor would play a heavy role in a movie. Nevertheless, this image was far from excellent, because soon after, Taylor fled on television with the hit series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and achieved a tremendous performance as Taylor's partner. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows. <br /> <br /> Another very good performance was here by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an old man who drinks joined in the buffalo hunt too. In his first scenes, Nolan really managed to take off from Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of Sierre Madre in 1948. Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan would join the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> The writing in the film is at best stiff. At the end of the film, it is the elements of nature that inspired Taylor. What about the elements of writing here?
