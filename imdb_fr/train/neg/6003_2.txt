Sundown - featuring the weakest and most accursed vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unpretentious and pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, who is so moved and every word uttered is so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half of the time looking at others. <br /> <br /> Vampires do not seem to have special powers - other than strength (sometimes), being able to extinguish a lamp with their minds (once) and .. That's it, really. Have you ever imagined that Dracula recoils uneasily after a battle for lack of bullets? Virtually no other movie-Dracula would eat this one at breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the film is that a human family of four gets caught. in a vampire gang fight - Dracula's vs. Old Geezer's. It could have been a good old B-movie film, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who takes this film a little too seriously and ends up ruining the remaining part of the film that is not yet ruined by clay bats, a mediocre game. and the ludicrous scenario. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's too stupid to be funny. Of course, there are fun times, but they are few and far between.
