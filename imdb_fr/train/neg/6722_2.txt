Have you ever watched a movie and after all, it's like a big "wtf!?" <br /> <br /> Welcome to lure. <br /> <br /> You can also immediately forget to have watched a food movie directly on the video, or even better, do not look at it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick are quickly defeated and lost their time in this adventure of mercenaries for whom the movie is hired and where the story is damn bad and where the action is nil, and what is the point of watching a movie? action if the action goes away? Robert Patrick, in particular, hits a new scene in an action sequence in which he fires with a machine gun while he stands on the hood of a moving school bus. With Charlotte Lewis and Canadian Scott Hylands (from the television series Night Heat).
