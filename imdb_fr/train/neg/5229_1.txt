boring stuff we got here. His short films of 5 minutes are better than that. know why? because it's only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long it lasts. <br /> <br /> The plot is a little ... er .. the last half hour is good, the rest is boring and not funny = (I had my hopes, the trailer made it funny , but the pace of this film is rather slow and sadly funny, no more than simple boring klaymen that cross and try to make us laugh ... it does not work. <br /> <br /> Maybe the next time, knox. <br /> <br /> Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing, but for the moment, it's not good.
