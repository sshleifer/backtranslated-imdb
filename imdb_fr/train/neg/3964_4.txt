Despite all the hype around this film, I kept an open mind as to what I would think in the end. And, although sometimes a bit slow, the first 90% of the film is pretty good, with more than a few scares of the "old days" that make us nervous and unstable. I actually thought that cinematography was excellent for many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, it's in its heyday. The end of the film and the ending are what seem to be miles apart from his body. The plot ends completely with an illogical conclusion and, the answer I was looking for the most - what really happened to Emma? - has not been elucidated! The logic of negative energy was ridiculous at best, and in the end I felt very deceived. What could have been a great horror movie was finally haunted by a terrible end.
