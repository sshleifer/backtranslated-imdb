Someone owes Ang Lee an apology. In fact, many people do it. And I will start. Hulk, Ang Lee's movie, never interested me, because of the almost unanimous bad reviews. Even premium cable channels seemed to show it rarely. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on the American network and, wow .... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /> <br /> Was it boring ! I almost did not get through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was speechless, Nick Nolte was awful, Sam Elliott was inimitable (and it's not funny, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descriptive face was the easiest to imitate with an infographic - and it was clear that Ang Lee Hulk was supposed to look like Bruce Banner in his unhappy state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle, I was ready to recognize Hulk as the worst superhero movie of all time. <br /> <br /> But something happened. About three quarters of the length of this tedious film, there was a truly exciting and - I dare say - reasonably convincing action scene that begins with Hulk's release of a containment room in a base military, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then straddling the stratosphere with a F22 Raptor, to be captured in the streets of San Francisco. It was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I must say that the CGI was very good. This does not mean that the Hulk was totally convincing. But that did not require more suspension of disbelief than in many non-superhero action movies. And it's quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end has become really stupid, Bruce Banner's father turning into a kind of metamorphosed villain, but the long sequence of action that preceded has shamed all heroic briefs. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really seemed like Hulk's CGI was doing its best to convince you that it was real and that it really interacted with its environment. It certainly was better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Okay, but what about the incredible Hulk? Guess what ... it's boring too! There are just a few Hulk appearances and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is awful. Maybe Hulk in Ang Lee's version sometimes seemed fictitious and caricatural in others - but he also had compelling moments. The Incredible Hulk looked really ridiculous. His complexion and muscular tone did not even look like a living creature, but a kind of computer-generated texture. It was really absurd. The lighting, the environment and the effects on the face did not look 5 years younger than those of Ang Lee, they were 10 years older. And there is really no excuse for that. We are really living in a time when computer programmers can ruin a film as completely as any director, actor or director of photography. Worse still, the writer and director of this movie seemed to have learned almost nothing from Ang Lee's "Failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is virtually emotionless. The general is so implacable, improbably unidimensional that he seems to be an imitator like Hulk. The love interest is not convincing (I must admit that Liv Tyler is more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, although both are rather easy to look at). Tim Blake Nelson exaggerates almost as much as Nick Nolte, although he is in the movie only a few minutes. Hulk does not really do much in this film, certainly not more than in the version of Ang Lee. The Incredible Hulk was a little faster, but since nothing really happened, it's not worth much. Oh yes, the villain is just as wrong as the Hulk. In reality, it is much more interesting as a human being than as a monster. <br /> <br /> This is how I can definitely say that Ang Lee's version was better: if I had the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, maybe I could look at near the good action sequences, or if not, try to appreciate a little more dialogue (more likely, I would make a quick turn to the right parts). But there is absolutely no scene in The Incredible Hulk that deserves to be seen once, let alone twice. It's really at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The CGI artist is an insult to the public - at least in Ang Lee's version, it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). <br /> <br /> It's quite mental - bewildering how the filmmakers intended to erase the negative feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by doing almost exactly the same movie. <br /> <br /> It's all the merit of Edward Norton who seems to be moving away from this film.
