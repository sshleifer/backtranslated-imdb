Before I saw that, I had already seen very bad Christmas movies. But once I saw that, "Jingle All the Way" was more beautiful than "The Godfather". "Santa Claus" is a merry film about Santa helping some kids, but it's almost demonic to watch him. Santa's merry ho-ho-ho is replaced by a diabolical and devilish laugh that I'm sure has diverted many Christmas children. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which goes with all the performances and the dialogue. Santa lives high above the Earth at the North Pole, where he prepares with children from around the world for Christmas. But Santa Claus has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch attempts to spoil Santa's Christmas by naughty boys and creating distractions, such as moving the chimney and heating the door handle. When Pitch gets a dog to attack Santa, it's with Santa Claus and Wizard Wizard Merlin to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie, besides being downright bad, is so weird. Satan dances a lot and he seems much happier than Santa Claus. Santa speaks of giving out gifts to all boys and girls, but he seems to only deliver to 5 children's homes in Mexico. Reindeers are toys to go up, and when the reindeer laugh, I'm surprised that it does not bring tears in the eyes of children ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are just Santa playing the organ while the children are singing on it. One of the strangest scenes is probably that of Santa, who turns Pitch in the buttocks with a mini-cannon and laughs excessively while Pitch dances in pain. I think it's better for parents to tell their grandchildren where their baby comes from than to show it to them. The only good thing is that it will make you laugh hysterically if you can enjoy a bad movie. <br /> <br /> My note: BOMB / ****. 85 minutes
