What remains to be said? <br /> <br /> I read all the reviews and most are right. . However, one person even went so far as to describe this movie as evil and Satan was defiling it (or something like that). Wrong?! Wow, what a shock. . I mean, TBN basically did this movie. Open your eyes please. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was the lowest level of nonsense of propoghanda that appeared over the years. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying thing about Omega code is how much money! they spent to do it. If this movie can be done, there are no limits, and therefore we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest Loses Omega Codes". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are in biblical stories, the new Dogma movie will pick up where Omega Code has never started.
