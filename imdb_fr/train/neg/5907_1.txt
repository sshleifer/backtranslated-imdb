Yeah, that's about it. This movie was horrible. Two minutes later, I wanted to break my eyes. This has been praised as an "innovative LDS comedy", but it's not even good for members of this church! I do not think any human being should be victim enough to watch a movie of this mediocre quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that no effort has been made in this film. It seems that the dull, casual and banal plot was assembled by two weasels, somewhat impregnated with the gift of coherent thought (at least semi-coherent). Then there is the acting game, which is dreary by everyone involved. Even the cameos do not animate anything. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget that our protagonist is a superficial fool that we would like to believe we can change, but this road is full of awkward embarrassing dialogues, hideous "gags" and many Mormon "jokes" that sensible person, whether they are LDS or not, should consider purely * stupid *! It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!
