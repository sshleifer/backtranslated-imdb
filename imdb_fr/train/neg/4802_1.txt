I give this wedding 3 years and thats the stretch. Adrianne Curry is a dirty, spoiled, controlling, strong mouth and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris that he has an image to protect and he must avoid striptease clubs. He married with her. Chris has low self-esteem and comes from another era. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination will not be happy after the end. His mother said he was an old cock and thinks it's his last attempt to regain his youth. Here 2 very good people who will end up in a nasty divorce. I do not think his former "Brady Family" will fit into his new life. I see them being excluded. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. He supported him and was there for him.
