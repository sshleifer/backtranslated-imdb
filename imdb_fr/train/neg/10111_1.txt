Horrific actor play, bad story, cheese makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie of my life. After 5 minutes, I decided to move quickly to see if something would happen that would buy ... This was not the case. The film was apparently shot in a furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the filming. You even see this same red chair in several different "places". If you want to make a film, rent at least an office building and an apartment, not a warehouse that echoes all the dialogue of your actor. (Note to producers) a small office space and an apartment for a month are much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are a little more versatile and more believable) If you spend your money renting this staff, I hope you get it with a return guarantee ... this will ask you to get your money back ... i only spent $ 2.99 to rent tonight and i feel ripped off.
