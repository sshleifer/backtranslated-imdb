As the 2000s come to an end, King Kong's adoptive daughter seizes the ad and announces that her show is coming to an end. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was tearing herself apart, I was laughing and screaming like a crazy Western West Indian. <br /> <br /> What does Oprah do? she takes famous people and puts them in her show. what kind of famous people? the people who suffered (just like her, except that these people lost more than their virginity), they suffered melted faces (true story), missing members (true story, see end of the paragraph) and domestic violence ( too much to count). and one way or another, they come into the series and tell their story, as if we had never heard it before tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about the loss of an arm by a shark since the first day of October 31, 2003. Do not tell me you do not have any resentment.) But the most important thing about Oprah was the interview with Michael Jackson in 1993, after being accused of being a pedophile. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has since died. but this particular show was about Michael's personal life, something that not many people knew at the time. <br /> <br /> The real influence of Oprah comes from middle-aged women and soccer players. They seem to think she sometimes looks like a personal Jesus. but all I see at Oprah is a big ghetto lady who's partying, and she just shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad his shows are coming to an end soon. we need better television programs.
