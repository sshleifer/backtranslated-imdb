Even if you adhere to the anti-free trade policy of this film, it's still the same tired note, played over and over again and again. Clink Clink Clink Even if you can accept a peroxide-haired preacher who pleads for a return to first principles, Reverend Billy is pretty hard to look like a serious character. The Reverend Clown is the one who wakes up every morning with no more ethereal aspiration than to see his own face on television before going back to bed that night. I must admit, he has a pretty woman, but it would take a lot more to save this bloody mess of a movie. The endless bus rides are the worst part - with the progress shown - can you guess? - by a colored line moving on a map. Aww, you guessed. Well, he has the virtue of being short. Is it the only good thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yes, I'm scared.
