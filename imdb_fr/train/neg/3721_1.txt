Two films are useful for frightening people before God, this one and Event Horizon. One has a meaningful and poignant message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious film can have. Too bad that Paul Anderson turned to the damn Resident Evil movies. He really had something to do. <br /> <br /> Thief in the Night is bothered by many obvious independent film attributes (game, storyline, dialogue and persuasion) and the film's intentions are evident from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from its failures. So we're stuck with The Omega Code, Left Behind and the other Tribulation movies. Their underlying element is that they are so concerned about selling their message: "Be saved, guys!" that everything else becomes secondary after hitting the public with a Bible. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not believe I write so much about such an ineffective film. Ignore him completely and return to Sam Neil who has widened his eyes. 1 out of 5
