If there was a zero rating, I would give it to that movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still could not do it from start to finish. I can not believe the multiple stars given by others and I can only assume that they know the actors or are disguised publicists! The acting is atrocious, the scenario is blah, the kid playing Nichole shows no emotion, even when it is threatened. The "southern" accent of the actress playing Amber's mother is laughable - I'm from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - believe me, nobody's talking like that! None of his emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves a much better treatment.
