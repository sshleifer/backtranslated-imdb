If I had not read Pat Barker's "Union Street" before watching this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately, it is not the case. It's actually my kind of movie, it's well done and I do not mean the opposite, but as an adaptation, it fails from all angles. <br /> <br /> The heartbreaking novel about the reality of living in a working-class area of ​​northern England seized my heart and refused to let me go for weeks after my end. I had tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy, and misery when I read about women in Union Street. Excellent. A novel that I sometimes had the impression of not being able to read, but that I simply could not repress. Depressing, yes, but extremely striking. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh dear. Hollywood took the truth and reality of Barker and covered with a layer of icing sugar. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a story of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. <br /> <br /> The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed in the character of Fonda, their stories are evoked, but many are rejected. I admit that some of Barker's stories are sensitive and too horrible for mass viewing, and that a movie with about 7 prominent protagonists is just not practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and true intestines of the novel are lost: darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard and the stench of poverty described graphically is replaced by the sun, pretty houses and a scintillating score of William. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope for "reality", I advise you to hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like "The Schindler's list "... but without the happy ending.
