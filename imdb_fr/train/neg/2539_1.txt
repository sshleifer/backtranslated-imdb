This is one of the worst wastes of 35mm motion picture films ever seen by the public, the sequel to the original, at least entertaining, pseudo-documentary film "The Legend of Boggy Creek". Bad scenario, worse scenario, etc., Dawn Wells had to hope that Gilligan would come to rescue her and bring her back to the island just to escape this trap.
