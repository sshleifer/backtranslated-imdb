This film is another Christian propaganda film in line with the Omega Code. This is not necessarily bad, but the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism to the message they want to convey. If you appreciate the polystyrene portrait of life in the streets and how the gospel can change a life, then maybe you will enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will Christian administrators learn that sometimes people say vicious words? It was frustrating to see portrayed criminals who are not allowed to swear (eh? Criminals say bad words?) And flat characters that I really could not understand. In addition, it would have been great if the film had shown some T & A. Now, that would be something I would pay to see. Who was the fool who compared this movie's communion story with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
