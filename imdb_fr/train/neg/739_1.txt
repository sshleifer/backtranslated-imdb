Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, start off on the assumption that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all of his lines must be taken seriously. It's just not true. Wells was really an Enlightenment heir and his main concern was that the self-satisfaction of the Victorian era could leave the unprepared Britons to the world that new technology could produce - both good and bad. <br /> <br /> Two of the terrible consequences ensue - the protagonist is portrayed as a feeble screamer (I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), rather than as a man struggling to live l irony of an incredible disaster; and the rumors of dialogue of "Victorianism" have seriously stated that Welles clearly wanted to be caught off guard. <br /> <br /> All of this sounds strangely like Ed Wood with a huge budget to spend on CGI effects - the Warner Bros. Comics Factory. 1940's could have done a better job. (Splattered blooddrops looked like red balloons, I was expecting them to fly off from one minute to the next.) Think of the yellow submarine as the old EC Comics did. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the theme loss, which steals the film of any reason to exist. Although the filmmakers bring the story back to its Victorian era, they completely miss the incredible way in which the Wells story predicted many horrors of the First World War - a fact that Wells himself did not forgotten who has reworked the theme in The Shape of Things to Come. <br /> <br /> Without any theme, all we have here is a lot of people running around in cartoon balloons, when they're not looking for high school production of Macbeth's rewrite by a drunk student. <br /> <br /> Really, this is the worst and most insane speech I've ever had since one of my friends persuaded me to see the cartoon "The Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago . This film was so pretentiously boring that my friend and I, along with two strangers, gave up the ridiculing half-way and sat near the screen playing cards, using the film as a light to see the cards - Its only use, As far as we all know, <br /> <br /> But since I already have an electric light in my apartment, I did not need this Wells stop. not avoid this movie - steal every copy you can (do not pay a penny) and burn each one of them. God in his wisdom created us just for this purpose.
