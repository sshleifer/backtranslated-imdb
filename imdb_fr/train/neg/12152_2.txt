Some journalists and their military escorts are trying to tell the truth about an epidemic of zombies, despite the "control of the media by the government". The composition of the film does not understand that George Romero's zombie movies only worked because he subtly kept his politics in the background of most of his films ("Land of the Dead" medium) . This satire is about as subtle as a brick in the face or a bullet in the head is more about this scenario. What is subversive or subtle about seeing a soldier masturbate to death and destruction? Something nuanced about the different commercials that are interspersed with the movie? Nope. In addition, the acting is uniformly horrible, the characters totally improbable and the plot devoid of meaning. If you add all this, you get the most incompetent zombie movie since the day "C.H.U.D. 2" raised its ugly head. <br /> <br /> My note: D
