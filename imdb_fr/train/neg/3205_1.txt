I notice in the comments that most people who talk about this movie base their remarks on the broadcast of MST3K. It's fair enough (that's after all, how he got his biggest publicity), but, having had the misfortune to see "Final Justice" in its original form, I'd just like to share some thoughts and comments on the non-cut version. <br /> <br /> First of all, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3K program, mainly because of a revealing scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I could use the character names). instead of those of actors, but I love typing the words "Venantino Venantini"), explaining why the fugitive character of Venantini can not leave Malta right away. (This is not a very convincing argument, but at least the filmmakers have tried to cover it.) Whether this scene was cut just for the time or because it did not provide much material to the riffs, I did not do not know. <br /> <br /> Another missing point in the original: The treason of Venantino Venantini by the stripper to Joe Don Baker, apparently not motivated by the MST3K version, is explained by an extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. Although this gives him a motive to turn against him, the whole scenario is really ... disgusting. (There is no other word for that.) <br /> <br /> Some of the moments worthy of the MST (the perpetual truncated cries of "Son of--" and the "sight shot" of the sheriff) were purely the result of the print run for the television they worked with and were missing from the original film. <br /> <br /> A scene I would like to see in the MST3K version: Before entering the bar to question some people Joe Don asks the Maltese policewoman who accompanies him to stay outside because "They see this uniform, they do not cooperate". However, Joe Don himself wears his ridiculous sheriff, cowboy outfit with a shiny badge! I can not imagine why they took this great opportunity to make fun of him ... <br /> <br /> One last comment on the original uncut version of "Final Justice": Why, oh why, have Do you feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's naked buttocks on the screen?
