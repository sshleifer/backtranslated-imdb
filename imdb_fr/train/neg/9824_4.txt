Not being familiar with American TV channels, when I read this on the cable of my in-laws, I first thought it was just a sci-fi movie at low budget, then after a few minutes, I began to think that it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of the Christian fundamentalist, then it made me understand: good sorrow, these people are serious! It's been a long time since I've seen anything so unintentionally hilarious. I hesitated to write a review of this for fear of offending believers, but I saw other criticisms and I thought it was possible. Difficult philosophical problem: how to make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what you criticize? Answer: make sure that the only people who appreciate it are those who hate the kind of movies you criticize. I suppose some liberals (ugh! Spit when you say that!) Could be offended by the scorn of filmmakers for those who are not obsessed with the J **** C ***** myth, but I do not did nothing - it was really funny!
