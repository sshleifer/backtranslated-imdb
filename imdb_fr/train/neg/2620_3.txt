After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the most fun way to see Cruella De Vil being punished for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was pretty funny and, in my opinion, better than animation. But there was really no need for a second one. First, if Cruela comes back, do not cure her and drive her crazy again. Get her out of jail and it's a snap. I thought it was not very funny. He is supposed to have only one original pup coming back. I expected him to be lucky because he was the most attractive, and besides having Roger and Anita too. However, they decided to do a complete overhaul and add not really, not even a hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot who thinks he's a (smart) dog. Gerard Depardieu's share was futile. In the end, Cruella suffers far too much, far too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She is cooked in a giant cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect of the first. It just did not work. It was too exaggerated and not too funny. I felt really sorry for Cruella.
