Justin returns home to live with his father as a strict and hard-nosed police detective, but it seems that Dad has turned the floor into three makeshift apartments, each housing odd tenants. Justin, right-wing idealist, is immersed in the world of the occult, murder, underage drinking and other harassment. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, did I see the same movie as almost every other commentator here seen ??? Intelligent, convincing, original, intense, intelligent, genius ???? !!? I did not see any of these things. What I saw is an uninteresting thriller, insipid, banal, extremely cliché, which is ripe with improbabilities and without any tension since the killer is telegraphed from the beginning of the film while giving his monologue / debate / discussion. And where are these moments of laughter and humor? I never laughed as much as I did, maybe because I was too busy not letting myself fall asleep by the movie. <br /> <br /> My note: D <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield; Second comment with various contributors as well as isolated music tracks; 4 featurettes (Making of, on the set, turning 1 piece into 4, & inside the black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Désirée Gould and Raine Brown; Alternate scenes; bloopers; a video clip for 'Addiction'; A trailer for this movie; And trailers for "Shock-o-rama", "Chainsaw Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bacterium", "The creature of the Hillbilly Lagoon" and "The Millenium Crises"
