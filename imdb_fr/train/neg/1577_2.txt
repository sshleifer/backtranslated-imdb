This classic legend of the 1997 film-white, devoted to the smoldering passion, has reached its well-deserved legendary status, as one of the greatest sagas of a doomed and desperate love of the screen. The omnipresent, continuous and progressive magnetism that exists between Judge Reinhold and the name of his name will not fail to thrill the hearts of many spectators by reminding them of the first crush on him. The brilliant scenario depicts this embryonic affair in front of the enchanted audience, motionless as an almost expressionist abstract cinematography that focuses on the desires just below the surface that come and go between the main ones. You can cut the sexual tension with a blunt tire changer. <br /> <br /> A tiny drop of perspiration at the end of the nose captures the radiant sun and leaves no doubt about its importance. Scenes like this one are not lacking and are to watch again and again. As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (to which this masterpiece is so often compared), the faces of the actors get closer as they discover the slow birth of the great love that will not be to haunt you forever. <br /> <br /> The now classic score of the RC soundtrack, with its unique and creative use of the solo synthesizer, highlights the emotion that flows like a leaky casing. <br /> <br /> If I had criticisms at all mentioning what I consider a minor defect (and I dared to risk the anger of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their heart), I would say that the trademark of "Runaway Car" - its sense of rising sexual tension - is briefly interrupted by the road scene which, after repeated viewing, seems a bit too long (and probably even useless?) to the eternal bittersweet story of interrupted love. <br /> <br /> Can I put forward what I perceive as the slightest defect in this triumph of modern cinema praised by critics? "Citizen Kane" had his "rosebud". . . "Runaway Car" should also have its motto. The film might have started with an extreme closeup of Judge Reinhold saying, for example, "A car is an extension of its owner!", And the rest of the plot could then be devoted to the analysis of each syllable, subtlety and nuance of that sentence. . If this plot had been made, this film could have exceeded "Titanic" at the Golden Globes that year, I am convinced. <br /> <br /> My only regret? That I did not read the novel first.
