What a waste load ... I can not even begin to describe how horrible this film was. It's really hard to believe the evaluation she's done here. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... especially if you enjoyed the first ginger shots. The first was well written, well directed, well executed ... a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. The second was "alrite" - decent as an independent film, but obviously not up to the first ... The third is an insult to the series, period. I note the movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, it's really going on in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all confused with some half-assed American mythology. The sisters have no real story, no progress, no clear relationship ... They just try to survive and be "together forever". It's about as deep as it gets. <br /> <br /> Stunned that the girls agreed to be in this pile of crap, after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh and something else, the staging action was terrible - people who came from nowhere regularly, like the girls who turn around and a meticulous candlelight installation with an American mystique of Indian origin sitting next door, about to start a speech. The sets were terrible, we could not forget that everything was based on a set, which did not really help. In addition, there was still snow outside the camp, but not a trace inside (on the board). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, everything is fine! I really hoped it would be at least as good as the second one.
