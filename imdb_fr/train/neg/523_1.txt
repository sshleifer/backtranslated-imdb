It's amazing to me what's happening for entertainment today. maybe I'm a fifties dinosaur and I'm not in touch with the current film generation, and that's apparently the case for this movie, so many people liked it. I found it dirty and vulgar. I did not say that about a lot of movies in my life but this one fits perfectly. Humor is sophomoric and raw. I'm not a politically correct person, and even I found gays jokes, not only not funny, but frankly offensive (I'm not gay). The main character of the film is not even a nice person, but pathetic. When the film was finally finished, I heard a number of people say how disappointed they were with what they had just paid.
