It's a really bad little movie. Certainly, the (tr) holy Trinity of origin was governed by the law of decreasing returns, the third, "The Final Conflict", degenerating into ridiculous sub-theme about halfway through the film, apparently having for sole purpose to provide the unnecessarily complicated deaths needed. has now become the raison d'Ãªtre of the series "Omen". But then to impose this jumped TV movie (beware of Omen DVD box buyers - do not be fooled by the widescreen transfer report, it was and remains strictly small screen material) on the back of A series It was unforgivable, in particular, that the producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard, executive producer and producer, endorsed the most rigorous criteria. I would give the plot if there was one, in addition to the usual death scenes (desperately attenuated for the sensibilities of the television) and some of the worst actors I've seen. Everyone involved in this project up to the caterers should be ashamed of this parody that has never been presented on the screen, let alone under the name of Omen. If a person is convinced by my opinion to avoid this mess, I will feel better for that.
