This film was rather interesting ... I had to watch it during a university course on India, but the synopsis tells you that this film talks about a thing when it does not contain a lot of hard and cold information about these details . The synopsis is not really faithful until the end, where they try to carelessly connect all the elements. The gore factor is superb, though. Even at the very beginning, you want to look away because the gore is quite intense. Watch this film only if you want to see coolness, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you have lost time listening to it. I've seen on other websites rumors that this movie is based on real events, but you can not find any information about it online ... so this movie was a waste of time to watch.
