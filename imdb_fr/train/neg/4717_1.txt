And the way it has been transformed into production surprises me. The main character is an odious sight that is not at all funny. I can not stand the character at all. It's a dumb ass that has nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon to have surfaced in the last 10 years, no kidding. Stories are both badly written and poorly executed. The jokes are as bad as those of Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not hate this show anymore, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title, even worse. <br /> <br /> It's as if this show was written by a 15-year-old couple who were basing the character on themselves and thought they were very popular when they're really arrogant and lack creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go fast and far!
