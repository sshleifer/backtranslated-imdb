The movies have already made me sleepy, but no movie has ever done it twice. It took me three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad. The women spoke with ease and the men were caricatures. And two of the supposed Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names, and spoke with obvious Chinese accents. I'm still trying to understand why the Emmenthal's men were sexually attached to each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a difficult choice: should I give this movie a score of 1? or two? <br /> <br /> Movies have already put me to sleep, but no movie has ever done it twice.
