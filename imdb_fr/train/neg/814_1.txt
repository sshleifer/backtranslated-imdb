This movie was just bad. Almost every shot of detective film is present and explained. The villain is leaving? check. Partner? check. Personality Wacky clash with the partner? check. Recruit with something to prove? check. The rookie shows a graying veteran. check. The only ones he did not mention were idiots shooting in the foot and retreating, but I suppose they keep those old chestnuts for the next Dooley outing. Add to that the battle of the sexes with Girl Power as well as tired old-fashioned gags and banal and excessive material such as the award-winning Dooley car that gets lost all the time and you have the recipe for a very bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.
