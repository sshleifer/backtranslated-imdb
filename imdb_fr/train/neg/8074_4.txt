As a member of your family who makes you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place but stumbles with poor execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing and directing efforts borrow freely from other more successful films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not give the premise; it is enough to say that it is not treated as well here as in these two superior films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller is the star of Cassie, about to leave for college. His current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and his ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (an actress Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being chased by two killers (?) Under a transparent mask. She survives the wreck but, while attending university, she has visions of the hospital test and the dead find and disappear, leaving her in a state of total confusion: who is dead? Who is alive? What is real? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors looks like an exploitation movie from a young teenager stuffed with blood, gorged with blood and splashed with blood. While he has his share of scenes of murder tracking the victim (abundant, repetitive and stupefying), but at least he tries to create a suspense through ideas rather than clich√©s, unfortunately without success. This creates a lot more confusion than cohesion, because the story becomes confused, messy and incoherent near the key points of the mystery (as predictable as it is.) <br /> <br /> Horror fans who take a copy will have no idea they are turning to a film that is more concerned with building a facade of troubled reality than giving a total count. The credit goes to Carpenter for trying to create something beyond a derivative horror movie for teenagers; pity he created a derivative psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves congratulations for showing his strength in central performance, developing his character and evoking a certain emotion as Cassie. It's great that filmmakers are trying something different, but the movie ends badly and fails. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
