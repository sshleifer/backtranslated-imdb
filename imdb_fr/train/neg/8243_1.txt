The word in the resume sums it up; h;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home. When they stop at a store for directions, they hit a parked car lighting a lighthouse on it, they suddenly saw a lighthouse behind them (ooooh). <br /> <br /> From here, everything screams, cries and is violent when they try to get away from this madman who lost him because of a lighthouse;), well, screams and the tears remain pretty much throughout the movie (very boring) The film is shot, with a cheap camera trying to give it a "real" or "shocking" aspect, however useless. In the absence of something better to compare it, "Blair's witch style". <br /> <br /> Cries and crying for just about all the movie with a shit sound were annoying, you literally have a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but this was not scary, only a painful and annoying shit film.
