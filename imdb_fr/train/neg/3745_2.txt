First of all; It is very difficult to try to describe the path of history solely from positions of firearms, germs and steel. The same thing was tried to make Marxists economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success can not simply be bad luck, the benefits of domesticated plants and animals. We see that all over the world, the benefits and bonuses are totally useless if they are not managed wisely. In Japan, there are not huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the world's largest economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, success is only medium-low. These two nations have had and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond said it was very important to understand the factors related to firearms, germs and steel, to UNDERSTAND. Perhaps the main factor in the world's difference is not geography, but the ability of people to understand and use things? The mental capacity to understand. And in this case, geography is only subordinate.
