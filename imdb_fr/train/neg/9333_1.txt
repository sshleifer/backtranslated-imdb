Terrible!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has a stupid monkey IQ.What a disaster.I could not believe how bad this movie was. The dialogues are just very weird and off topic, the camera sometimes works horrible, the music sometimes sounded like a soundtrack from Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how much it can get worse. Some "actors" on the side are a total disaster. who can hang down on my body is falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is an excellent actor but who knows maybe he is in a difficult financial situation to take part in a movie also fiasco. . . . . this film should have been presented to all students of all film schools just to teach them not to make a film
