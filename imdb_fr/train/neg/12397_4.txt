I read somewhere where this movie was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir, "Criss Cross". I found this last disappointing but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a "neo-black" because it is nowadays and in color, two things that purists would like to see disqualified for the status of film noir. <br /> <br /> However, the biggest negative point was not the cinematography (it was good) but the confused scenario. Hey, some of Dashiell Hammett's 40s stories were similar, but some of them did not matter to me either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by setting backs in the story that seemed to be every three minutes. No wonder it's following this story. It was ridiculous! In 45 minutes, there is so much confusion that nobody cares anymore. I know I do not have.
