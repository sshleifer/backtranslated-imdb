I did not like the returns of Frosty and this one. Both films are absurd with badly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been made but the return of Frosty was worse than that because of the unique snowman they drew. The Winterwonder area of ​​Frosty was fantastic, as was the original drama that warms the heart. The only good thing about this film was Frosty: the snowman looked like the classicism of the '60s. A funny phrase, like when they were talking about things that are not real, then Frosty walks around the window humming, whistling all he did but everything else poorly written and badly animated and I barely understood the plot. I saw the DVD cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art seemed insignificant. So I did not pick it up until this year, because the pictures on the back seemed a little touching, but I played this movie. The artistic characters, like the DVD, were annoying, and what was happening was horrible. I watched it at night and found it boring to fall asleep (wait, I always do it when I look at something while I fall asleep), but this film was generally boring <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: Grade C <br /> <br /> This looks like another special holiday scam in the frosted returns and this one. This one is the fourth sequel wrong as Home Alone 4 and although I thought the movie was OK but the game at home 3 was great. But it's like a bad house alone 3 and 4 people hate like that. My sister did not look at her very much because when she came into my room to watch two and a half minutes, she walked away like, "I hate animation!" I agree with her, just like the third, Frosty returns. Horrible plain!
