You want to know a secret? This film is nil. In fact, I do not know, because if you indulge in the plagiarized versions of the original films, you may find this amazing movie (this film is a plagiarized copy, I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a typical scenario; a bunch of so-called cool teenagers who love to vacation in Florida and behave themselves by behaving very much like the kids they are. The only idea we get at this point is the extent to which the director has been able to illustrate a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the film takes a little momentum and begins to illustrate the beginning of unprecedented killings. The third half hour of the film will certainly remain a mystery to me because I turned it off before I could delude myself further thinking that the film could still have something interesting and original to show. As far as history is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. A group of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are having a party, they start slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) getting killed because they know some kind of silly secret. The only common thread of the massacres is that all the victims were enrolled in a common high school. One thing that surprised me about this movie, though, is how much betty (I'm not sure about her name ... the blond character) looks like reese witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me about the movie is that it made me jump from my seat several times. Does this make it a work of art? Absolutely not because my 12-year-old niece had me drop a glass of orange juice because she "booed" me when I was about to go through the door of the guest room. .. what's the difference between the director and my niece 12 years ???? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure about you, but I do not ..
