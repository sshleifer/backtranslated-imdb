Ho-hum. The deadly biological weapon of an inventor (Horst Buchholz) may fall into the wrong hands. Without knowing it, his son (Luke Perry) has always worked on the ant√©dote. Enter the CIA agent, Olivia d'Abo. The car for cat and mouse is continued and the shooting begins. Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore are also part of the cast. Moore seems to upset this mess, certainly not one of his best efforts. Perry fans will accept. Abo is wrong for the role, but it's nice to watch.
