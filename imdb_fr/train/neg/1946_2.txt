As a mother of 2 young children growing up or should I say grew up with the many reincarnations of Scooby, I feel well placed to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If as a family we had not seen any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby we learned that we might have enjoyed it as a lightweight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon. But this is essentially the problem that arises in its current format so light that it will not have the longevity of "old" Scooby and the gang. I am sure that the return on investment will be fast, but I am convinced that the long-term purchase of young and old is likely to be lost. My 6 year old son, who saw the new version, was really unhappy and said without hesitation that she was very badly animated and that it was not comparable to the last series (Where are you?) . <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but infinitely better than that. Hope you will get a clue about the producers.
