Robin Williams gave a great performance in The Night Listener, as did other members of the cast. However, the film seems rushed and leaves too much detail to be considered a "must see". I think the problem is that there is not enough established relationship between the caller and the Gabriel Noon (I had to spell it that way because IMDb wants to automatically correct the correct spelling of the character "Nobody"). The film runs a little over 01:30 and in the first 15 minutes, it seems, noon begins his search for Pete Logande, the little interlocutor. <br /> <br /> This happens after he has spoken to the mysterious caller. about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too thorough. They mainly consist of knowing how you are going ... I'm in the hospital ... why did you move your boyfriend ... etc.? In the book, the child becomes almost the psychiatrist and the vice of midday and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, once he discovers that it disappears and thinks that it could be a hoax . <br /> <br /> In the movie, noon becomes obsessed with Logande's research, but the audience is left wondering why? Since there is not really a strong bond established between noon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but these calls and this relationship were essential to the onscreen setting, as they lay the groundwork for the rest of the film. As he does not, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising in Maupin's other work, Tales of the City. When it was turned into a mini-series, it worked perfectly.
