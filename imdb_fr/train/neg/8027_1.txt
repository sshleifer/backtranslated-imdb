I watched this movie. Until the end. And it was really not easy. It's so boring, badly played and almost in the details stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe that creators take it seriously. Even more difficult to believe is how this "product" was recorded on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see a horror movie, look at "Scream", but if you want to laugh Noisy and have fun watching kids running in the woods yelling at each other and showing their inability to look at the dark area.
