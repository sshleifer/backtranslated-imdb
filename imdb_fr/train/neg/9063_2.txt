The fact that most of the budget allocated to this film is probably on the list of heavy actors would not have mattered if it had been organized with talent and imagination and with some sympathy for the satirical intent of the original. Instead, we have sequences of songs and dances featuring quaint beggars and whores, and the final alienation is obtained by stepping back to reveal that the action took place on a music scene. Hall, appropriately for a production that is closer to Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. Actor's talent is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good but do not have to put in a lot of effort: Migenes has at least a great voice and a certain sensitivity for the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack, but struggles with the character, camouflaged in a false accent of plum. Harris Peachum is embarrassingly handled and Polly is atrocious. The adaptations of the lyrics, the screenplay and the music are often delicate: it was discouraging to base the film on the simplified version of Marc Blitzstein, but his lyrics were singable, unlike most that was interpolated by gestures of fidelity . And the attempt to go beyond the small budget by filming claustrophobic angles on sets wrapped in fogs lit gaudy blues and oranges as if, by a boon, Vittorio Storaro failed completely - the film looked cheap, mediocre and realized without thinking. Shameful.
