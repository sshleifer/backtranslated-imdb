So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing. The first segment, led by Brian Henson, may have offered few new stories or real frights, but at least he was well-directed, suspenseful and visually interesting. a mini-series. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was appalling and not in a good way. The scenario is bad, forcing the protagonists shallow and unfathomable to act illogically to move the plot, and inviting the characters to walk without stopping for the purpose of an awkward and useless exposure. The acting is excessive and unconvincing, and I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a million spins to make the story spooky, but with acting and amateur writing, the end result looks like a first-year film school project, with camera moves for their own interest and little frame or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I will be sorely disappointed. I look forward to William H. Macy's release and hope that he will have a director and a decent screenwriter for his segment. So far, quality is far too incoherent to be predicted.
