I just could not finish this movie. I escaped after what I would say was my nomination for the price of the most miserable sexual suggestion attempt: a scene in which Pia Zadora, during a picnic, stands between two boys who want it. One (the good boy) begs her to see the error of her behavior. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she would like a hot dog, which he then gives her. At the level of the crotch. I hope I do not waste anything to say that she turns and takes the hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
