Two houses, a street, a phone booth, a car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a big horror movie. All you need is blue light, ambient music and ... over. Not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy though! <br /> <br /> I like to organize from time to time "bad movie nights". The concept is very simple: have a drink, go to friends who love cinema and dive into the worst that cinema can offer. For such an evening, this filthy peace is one of the best. Guaranteed laughter! <br /> <br /> What is strange is that Van Rouveroy continues to defend his film as if it were a great feat. To witness this, you will have to listen to the comment track of the DVD. Again: do not believe and laugh guaranteed!
