Philippe. K. Dickian film. And an honest man by the way. Better than the Paycheck (Woo) and this abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, the end of twists and cheesing was a little too much for me. Halfway through the film, I had already begun to fear such an end and I was unfortunately right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. Not at all. The first half (as many have already commented) is great. There are places where you begin to wonder if the director intended to convey the message that the meaning of the show is an extremely important thing in the future (we will do the same on sneaky things because we CAN ) or if it is simply a combination. But paranoia is there and feels "out of the game" too. Good one.
