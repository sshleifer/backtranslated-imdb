ORCA is not really bad, but it's not really the best time of Richard Harris either. As a demented fisherman similar to Ahab, Harris goes into the game of death with an avenging killer whale after killing his "wife" and unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert involved in Harris. She often shouts how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and ends up ending up in the Arctic fighting mad whale revenge. There are no special effects apart from what looks like a round mirror for a whale eye - there are innumerable Harris plans that are reflected in the eye so the public understands that the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, as a member of the Harris team, has a particularly unpleasant relationship with the Orca and most of the actors, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, have not done very well.
