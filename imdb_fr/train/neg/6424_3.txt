A screenwriter would be a screenwriter and his agents (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) would be forced to live in a self storage center led by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) who, in their opinion, would be the serial killer terrorizing the city , the "Costume Killer" (so named because after injecting Windex into his victims, he puts them in stupid costumes). They convince him that the story of his life would make a good film and bring together a group of filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson), and discover that the art of shooting can be a murder. <br /> <br /> There is more in this film but it was unfortunately left in the editing room and it shows (the rumor is that the studio wants a black comedy "clearer"). Our defeat (and the actors, who all do a good job and deserve better) because it looks like an exceptional black comedy but only goes up to a mediocre cutie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Ron Perlman, it's absolutely worth it to be fair for his performance. His comic timing is excellent and he's lucky enough to make great impressions (he was not joking when he said in the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed intervention when he switched to Jerry Lewis mode). It's just fun to watch in this one. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in his role as double scout (but essential).
