Okay. So I just came back. Before starting my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to love this movie. I know I was negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and really love the movie. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that every imaginable horror cliché is in it. And it's not just the fact that they do all they have to do to scare the jump (get into a baseball bat left on the floor, do you make fun of me?). It was not scary. I was surprised by one thing: there was more blood than I thought ... which does not say much. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Donna who drops her at her mother's house. She enters ... goes up the stairs. The camera shows his dead father on the couch. Scary. She climbs the stairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene takes place. Find her brother on her bed, seemingly dead (how could she know?) He did not have a blood stain on him. The killer arrives, Donna hides under the bed, mom dies. She runs outside shouting for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Therapy session. This confused many people - everyone was wondering if her family was really dead or imagining it - and she tells how nightmares started coming back. A dialog about filling follows. <br /> <br /> We stick to hunting pretty quickly. Few scenes at the show, they go to the hotel. Of course, the murderer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police / family were not informed before he was already there). More charges ensue. <br /> <br /> I will not go on talking about what's going on in the movie, because I do not want to ruin it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan has already posted an article about it. But on the subjects of death: they were not so exciting. Theater people actually laughed a lot (an experience I had never experienced before in a horror movie, not even in When A Stranger Calls) in many of them. One in particular: the bus boy who gives the most hilarious "scared" face I have ever seen. The only death involving blood was Lisa's, and it was pretty rare. His throat is sliced, blood (if you can even call it that - it was almost black) splatters the curtain. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her several times after strangling her to death. Um okay? The film was one of the clearest clichés I have ever seen. Let's see here .. obliged to close-curtain-mirror-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could say they were struggling). Mandatory backup in the killer. Check. There is also the backup scene in the lamp, but you've all seen it. Oh, you say you want a fear of birds? Well, you have it! (Yes, they managed to integrate one of these). And, of course, the scene where we have security on all outings, but he still escaped. Should I continue? I could. <br /> <br /> If you say the characters are not stupid, are you kidding me? "Oh, even if the massive alarm sounds, saying literally: PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I'm going upstairs to pick me up." These characters were among the most imperfect and stupid characters of all time. The only nice character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid movements of the movie. "Oh, I just realized that the psycho-teacher is here! I have to leave my powerful boyfriend behind me to leave alone to prevent it! Oh, shoot, the elevator is slowing down? I guess I go take the stairs and run off to the construction site! "Ugh. At the end of the movie, they all deserved to die. The only death for which we ever felt remorse was Donna's boyfriend (I do not even remember his name - is it so bad?), And at that time, the audience was completely drained of this film without clichés. </ Span>. There were some positives - the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well played. But that's about all. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 1/5, and it's generous. Just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few) and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People were up after the end of the movie and the buzz that followed was very negative. Expect bad legs for this one.
