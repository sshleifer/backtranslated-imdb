OK, if you're looking for another Bastketball journal, it's a fake movie. <br /> <br /> I am articulated around two brothers. Max, the youngest, has a major addiction to cocaine. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This film is supposed to show the fall of reality to the extreme extremes that drugs allow. This is not the case, however. This shows that cocaine can be fun whatever the situation. The film is mainly about Max and his ways of separating. Finally, Adam can not stand the stress of his work anymore and starts to take the same (perscription drugs). <br /> <br /> Do not go down in what cocaine really does to you, have boring, low budget scenes, and the older brother's game, Adam, is horrible. to pass and receive rewards is not a heart. If you want a clear and true story film about the extreme world of drug rentals, if not buy "The Basketball Diaries". And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this film, but if you think to enjoy it. Try to see for yourself ...
