Well, what to say. THE GOLDEN CHILD is in the category "Too bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy has funny (and sometimes annoying) stories, but you are always entertained. Chales' dance has never been so bad as his role as villain Sardo Numspa (what name has he been told?). <br /> <br /> Who should watch THE GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... Hard to say, but my best guess would be people who like embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting , a bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
