This is only criticized by David Hasselhoff. Well, so let me tell you. Compared to the waste they call the horror that comes out nowadays, this movie is not so bad. He has beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but does not speak very well. There is a big scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows her beautiful body. Linda Blair does not do anything here as well as Hasselhoff. 3/10
