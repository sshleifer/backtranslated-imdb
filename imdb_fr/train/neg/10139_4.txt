You have to hand it to Steven Seagal: whatever his other faults, he tastes good for women. If you choose a Seagal movie, there is a good chance that there are one or more beautiful women. And generally, they do not work like candy for the eyes; they mingle with the action and fight, shoot with firearms, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" features the duo Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips that go well with those of Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones. find the time to involve them in a fight of cats AND a few lesbian caresses! And if it seems that I spend a little too much time talking about it, it's because the rest of the film, although passable, is so uninteresting that it's hard to find many other things to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who seems not to have the trouble of pretending to care. As a military-type actor, there is very little fighting and he does not fit into his role (a stealth fighter pilot, "the best in the world," of course) very well, which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.
