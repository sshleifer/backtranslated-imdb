If anyone wants to do a very, REALLY bad movie, "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets a yardstick for measuring the depth of evil. <br /> <br /> Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... A poor con in a "hairy" white suit that looks sewn with pieces of discarded carpet. Work slowly, painfully, through other special effects that prevent the viewer from suspending disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the sake of seeing it). <br /> <br /> On reflection, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.
