I will not spend much time or energy on this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive that I felt like I had to let people know that not everyone was so excited, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt to create a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma. Some scenes looked promising, playing with the visual dimensions, but could not handle the rest. I felt like I was stoned again for the first time after having semi-philosophical conversations with other teenagers. <br /> <br /> What a vain attempt to raise the Dutch cinema to new heights. I would rather look at Jesus is een Palestijn, without all the pretensions and with a direct humor, while asking questions about life and the realities that we create ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and apparently will never be.
