Anurag Basu, co-director of the KUCCH TO HAI flop, made his debut in this film. <br /> <br /> The film was ahead of its time, although it has a story not so different and it comes closest to HAWAS. released a week before and luckily it was better and it worked better <br /> <br /> The film starts well, the guilt of Malika is well shown at the beginning although the scene with Emraan-Malika is too coarse / vulgar <br /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well managed and the turn of the story where Ashmith confronts Emraan is brilliant <br /> <br /> The rhythm advances quickly and the spectator is kept on the wire but the second The song of Emraan's girlfriend is not totally convincing <br /> <br /> The cop track also seems half-cooked <br /> <br /> The finale is too filmed too > <br /> Directed by Anurag Basu is good The music is a winner, all the songs are fabulous The work of the camera was amazing <br /> <br /> Emraan played very well his series of vicious shots. was the role that made him famous and even if he continued to play such roles and he became bored In this film, he was superb. Ashmith was also good in his role for once. He did a good job and one of his only good performances. He also looked good. Malika was brilliant in her role, especially in the second half, but her dial distribution was sometimes not up to par Unfortunately, she rarely showed such potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is well
