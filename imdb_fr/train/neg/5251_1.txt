This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has easily made the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... it keeps repeating the same situation. This shows no character development. It does not even show violent and / or sexual content, and adds nothing new to the psycho-killer subgenus. So lame that it should be shown in film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first film. <br /> <br /> By the way, where the heck is the "talent"? there are scenes that have been shot almost identically; there are scenes that have two or more master shots and it is awful to see the action jump from one shot to another without reason. The camera hardly ever moves, as if "the very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. The actors who play the main roles behave like amateurs and the secondary actors are hardly credible. There are more holes than plot in the scenario (if there is one) ... <br /> <br /> A really discouraging film and a director as talented as possible.
