From block-scanned sequences to acting acting that makes Keanu "I'm so much wood that I could be a Plank me," Reeves looks like an Oscar winner, that film bites (the pun is not wanted). The best thing about this is the eRATicate box in the 2nd segment (which out of three seemed to be the most powerful element in terms of scenario and "twist"). If only I had spent Â£ 3.99, it cost me something else, like erm .... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy this, you are really disappointed, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wood than a 2x4, then go for it. However, if you want a quality action for werewolves, look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The Wolf Hunt.
