It's really a horrible film and a loss of 2 hours of your life. It is both bland and offensive, with nudity and a lot of violence. However, nudity is not so exciting, and the violence is repetitive and boring. In addition, the plot is at best fragile, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and the acting is one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie was supposed to be funny, but it is not. I did not laugh once looking at him, or even a smile. The directors of this film tried to combine a comedy film with an action movie and failed in both cases. <br /> <br /> Some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad, but that's not the case.
