Hunters pursue what they think is a man through the forest, although the public sees him as a werewolf. The hunters never seem to notice, because after shooting him, he looks normal when they behead him. <br /> <br /> A doctor transplanting the eyes of the werewolf into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, has sex with his nanny (Stephanie Beaton) before even removing his bandages. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he discovers that his wife is also cheating on him. When a smoke machine sends clouds in front of an amateur painting depicting a moon (with a false tree branch in the foreground), it turns into a werewolf! His chest grows, cracking his shirt, and he wears on his head a giant werewolf mask with red eyes. His pants remain intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, although some sort of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows sometimes look monstrous at him. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a lot of blood and blood, and these are pretty well done. There is even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie. However, when a man falls from a height, a rather bad dummy does the job. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak, who is a kind of occult expert, and he also accidentally falls on a little man with crutches named Androse who is also such an expert. They try to help him a bit. <br /> <br /> Rich kills people who did it wrong. A policewoman investigates the murders and tries to beat Beaton, who does not care about lesbian scenes, so nothing escapes. <br /> <br /> Quite cheap, but between nudity and blood-and-blood history combining (in some way) the most dangerous game with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man, it's a little fun. Available alone or in a Scream Queens Vol. 1.
