WARNING: THE REVIEW CONTAINS LIGHT SPOILERS <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe in which Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, edgy and controversial independent film. Unfortunately in this dimension Gone ... is a morphest flashy, empty, powered testosterone, with Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are not worthy of exposure, he and his many friends have four days to fly. fifty expensive cars, only one with an alarm. This crew is made up of the guy with funny ears who would have been the new Superman; a guy who drove electricity into The X-Files; a professional football player and two symbolic black men. <br /> <br /> Their enemies are cops, rival car thieves and Cracker's Bilborough. His Manchester accent is appropriately flattened and expanded for an American audience accustomed to this sort of thing. something from Daphne to Frasier. There is also Angelina Jolie, who has no character; to record to be a receptacle to the sexual desires of men. Cage and she are supposed to be old flames, which is strange because they never have anything close to a normal conversation over a length of 135 m. The film is actually so poorly characterized that everyone has a "moment", a violin playing in the background to accentuate "emotion". It's not a spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous hand-balloon maneuver by Paul Gasgoine and is quite threatening when he is silent) has only one line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot, but because his eloquent summary of the dubious morality of the film after his dumb appearance throughout the course is amusing. Allegedly. After struggling through this in his London drawl "not-all-to-act-but-that-will-do", Cage shouts "I always thought you were from Long Island". My ribs, as you can imagine, were really tickled. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the least developed aspect, from the police officer to the tactless comic, to the two black characters. This sees the biggest aspect of Hollywood take root; why can not a black man appear in an important film without being constantly aware of his complexion and constantly referring to it? The young man, who, like the former, discusses during the whole of his speech, proclaims: "We blacks do not like the cold ... we are tropical people". He then continues to express the need to smoke a joint and watch Roots. He is of course parodying the image of blacks, but is it funny? His older counterpart can not speak without referring to himself, and therefore to his color, in the third person. "My black ass" this, "my black ass" that. Does anyone know blacks who really speak like that? I did not think. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is played almost continuously and with the increase in volume, some tracks - especially "Do not Stop The Rock" of Apollo 440 - so strong they are actually more audible than sound effects and dialogue. The surround system even separates the two to such an extent that it makes them sound like two different movies that work together. Here, no concept of background music, it is the auditory equivalent of watching a movie while the stereo in the back of the cinema is running at full speed. "Keep this music, young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film in the world and I enjoyed it in many ways. It's just that it's predictable, lazy and unintelligent, with minimal effort in its construction. Apparently, box office expectations are drastically reduced for this film. After being force-fed for several years, it seems that the general public is becoming aware of this fact.
