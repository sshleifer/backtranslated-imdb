This movie is probably the worst I've seen. Bad acting, bad scenario, all bad. To compare it with two other films of the same kind and the same period is interesting. Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem more robust, both in history and in staging. It's always Albert Pyun who also directed these two! <br /> <br /> the story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, perhaps because of an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special race of robots (cyborgs) lives on human blood and that's the story ... Cyborgs need a lot of humans to fulfill their "prophecy" and humans need someone to stop them. A girl accompanied by a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of cyborgs has been designated by destiny to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director tries scenes of stylish fights in Hong Kong with participants flying high and jumping away. The film fails miserably in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film for the only reason that most people will have a new "worst" movie with which to bond. And for fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg" because I think it's a very underrated movie with a fairly high entertainment factor. And if you can not stand Van Damme, go see "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I noticed this movie 1/10.
