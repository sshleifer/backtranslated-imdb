I do not go and give them my 10 dollars, I went to buy the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager and she finds silly previews and prefers to look at the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy actually, she thinks she looks more like a slut than a duke daisy. These shorts she might as well not wear at all. And since when has American Pie had anything to do with the Dukes TRIBUTE to them for putting this dirty sentence on having sex with a car. In itself, this should have given the movie a rating of R. The only good thing that could come out of it is a meeting movie with the originals. Allow everyone to hope. So, the people who went to see the film will see what it should have looked like
