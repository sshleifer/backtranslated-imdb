Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. These three lines summarize this little shabby movie that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the movies. and his ... # 1 Movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers is more like Micheal Jackson. A Chinese lady who falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005, I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They will try to chase Sam-I-Am and that bad guy who runs away with it. (I hope they will not ruin the classic book.) Do not waste your time and money seeing this.
