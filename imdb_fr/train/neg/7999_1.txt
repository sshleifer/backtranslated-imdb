It's by far one of the worst movies of my life. I gave up watching it after an hour and I really missed this hour. the game is horrible and there is almost no conspiracy. I guess someone had the strange shape of an animal and started to tell a story. borrowing ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens does not give a movie like this. If this were to be a big Korean movie, I'd rather not even see a Korean trailer ... <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means that the film is promising. I think that all Koreans with Internet access for online games have rated this movie a higher than 8, even if they have no idea what it is.
