It's not a horror movie, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, to avoid by any amateur of serious horror. No plot, terrible actor and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer, you'll know enough ... It's a shame that it is possible on VHS or video when there are so many good films unavailable. If you love vampires, try Hammer Productions or Italian gothic Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. These are masterpieces if you compare that with this basket. Note = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one to have this opinion.
