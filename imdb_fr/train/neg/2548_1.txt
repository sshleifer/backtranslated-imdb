The fact that this film has reached the stage of renting in Norway is strange. This film is just awful. This picture quality is just a little better than that obtained with a mobile phone and the plot is really bad. The main character is simply annoying and the rest is nil. Anyone affiliated with this film should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this film are named after them is extraordinary. And the distributors; did they even see him! It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. To call it comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this film by buying it or renting it.
