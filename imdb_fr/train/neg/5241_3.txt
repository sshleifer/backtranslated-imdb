Tell the truth. I'm a little stunned to see all these positive reviews from so many people, which is also the main reason why I decided to watch this movie. And after seeing it, I was really disappointed and it comes from the guy who likes this kind of film. <br /> <br /> I'm completely surprised by this movie - it's like a children's movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and all of it involves little kids cursing and cursing. I'm not at all right, but it really went too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The story of two guys was sent to the Big Brother program for their irresponsible behavior. There, they met a child obsessed with breasts and the other a medieval monster. <br /> <br /> The name itself is not at all related to the story. They are not a model and do nothing but serve their time for what they did. The story is very predictable (although expected) and the humor is lame. And have not we already seen the same characters (played by Mc Lovin ') in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and I almost fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, the casting was going well, after all, he was the producer of the script. And the acting is pretty much as expected when you watch this type of movie. And the direction, what are we waiting for? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and this movie is also bad. But he has always managed to bring a star to attract his appalling film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I did not feel completely restive, but a total waste of time. Only nude scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. I really do not see why I should recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> For: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Not funny, dreadful story, nudity and children do not mix. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
