Well, what can you say about sitcoms. He is often quite lame, devoted to morale and clear. So is this show! That had a boring casting, even though A.Bynes is okej in his own way, the rest is just stereotypical shit ... as always. We have all seen it before and we will probably see it again when this show is canceled. Because, let's face it, it's a mediocre and fair show. Like most sitcoms are .... <br /> <br /> Well, in short. If you want to watch a good entertainment, you can take a break of twenty minutes in front of the mirror. Make faces and move on ... It's more fun than this show!
