This film dropped me a bit. It was very similar to the movie Jaws, when Hopper told the mayor to close parks, it was like Roy Shider, who told the mayor to close the beaches. They both said no way was summer! But the box says that Hopper must enter a killer's mind and think of it as such. But it does not really do anything interesting or exciting. I am not even a little convinced that he and his partner have worked in the police when they are in the office and wonder how they are going to solve this case. They simply say: let's do the police work and we will solve it. And what's up with all the older men with cues. I did not even start believing that they were mafia bosses. And then the guy who doubted the guy chosen by the crowd to find the killer. With his hundred-dollar haircut, he thinks his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come on what crisp lines. I thought he was going to hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I used this movie and I would not buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was funny to see the microphone above the stage where Hopper is getting ready for coffee.
