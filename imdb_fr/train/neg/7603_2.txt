I will be frank. I'm not one to make politically correct movies in which the woman plays the big ass that is not going to take anything. If one of the cast members wanted it, they could have won in the blink of an eye. It was fun on MST 3K, but do not rent the real version. Believe me. Have I ever lied to you?
