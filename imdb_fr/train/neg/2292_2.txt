First, I must admit that Batman: The animated series is by far the best Batman series. We watched when he was on TV. I did not realize there was a season four. In fact, there were none. BTAS ends with season 3 and he should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to play with a good thing? Catwoman and Poison Ivy now have terrible gray faces. The Joker looks beyond the scary, it seems that every time he changes his appearance, he looks more and more scary. He does not seem to have any students anymore and now he does not even look like a human being at a distance (although he is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who is the best batman. Although he now looks like Superman. There is nothing that sets it apart, because they are both alike. Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred just has pupils eyes, looks more like a character of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I watched three episodes of disc 1 of the series and I already find that this version is more violent and graphic ( there is blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: The animated series, there is no Batman 4 season. They just included this series in season 4 for reasons of profitability. If they come to publish it under the title The New Batman Adventures, I do not think many people would buy it. <br /> <br /> Spare disappointment and stay true to seasons 1-3.
