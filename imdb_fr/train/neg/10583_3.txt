I'm sorry to say, but the role in this film is horrible. The dialogue rings as if they were reading their lines for the first time. I may have had the "dress rehearsal" version by mistake. The director uses excessively slow motion during special effects, perhaps to try to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written and the fight sequences are better than the ones I've seen in many action movies. The fighting seems very real. But all this happens when, on many occasions, two main actors miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapons, grenades, mortar bullets and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are certainly some of the worst shots I have ever seen, especially when they have a truck on the run about 30 meters away, and every bazooka shot is at least 15 meters wide. These bazookas require a serious calibration of the site.
