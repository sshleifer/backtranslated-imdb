Disney has not yet encountered a film for which he could not do at least two sequels. And this one was no exception to Disney's desire to give a weak story to receive a quick reward. In one way or another, although I did not pay to look at her, I feel depreciated by looking at her. <br /> <br /> Ariel grew up and had a daughter. However, do not allow the girl to go to sea because of any threat from the sister of the dead marine witch. Here we are again. <br /> <br /> The girl is cheated (of course) and helps the witch of the seas. After a not-so-glorious battle, she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony. Yawning. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see here. Go back to your lives. "RE-"
