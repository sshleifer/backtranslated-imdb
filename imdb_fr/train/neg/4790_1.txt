I hated this movie. The original Phantasm had such an atmosphere and a wonderful mystery. Like many horror movies of the '70s, it looked a lot like a terrifying, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80's, inflated the action, while maintaining this focus on the mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is horrible. This fastidiously explains all the strange events of the previous films, which diminish instead of increasing their power. It shamelessly degrades the images of the first Phantasm as an inexpensive reconstruction of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this film that they look more like domestic parasites than threatening death orbs. Hundreds of people are hanging from the ceiling, like Christmas balls swaying in the draft. Does not someone - the master props, the DP, the editor, the director - notice or worry that they look so bad? Worse still, Phantasm III presents a cheeky and not funny joke after another. What a difference with the intensity of the first film. The original Phantasm used humor to dispel his relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to prepare countless cheap jokes about Reggie's fad: many refer to the "flying bullets" of the ha-ha movie, oh, I understand, bullets. The crew may have had a kick for these jokes, but they are on us.
