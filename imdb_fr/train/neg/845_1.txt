Too bad you can not vote zero star on IMDb, because I would not have hesitated! In fact, I would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I bought this film thinking that thanks to Michael Madsen, it would be a good thing ... No luck! This film was shocking! Imagine a movie duration 'The fat and the beautiful', well, Primal Instinct was not even close to this result, and I thought before that there would be nothing worse than a feature film of the movie 'Fatty and beautiful'. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do that to us? The worst part is that I did not go too far, hoping I could reveal in the end that it was an unhealthy joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad movie. . <br /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Director - Zero Stars, Scenario - Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Zero Stars, Zero Stars -announce - A half-star, Graphic Design - A half-star, Menu DVD - A half-star. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's very important to have seen bad movies so you know which movie is really bad. It is for this reason that I am happy to have seen this film, so that I have a bad film to place at the bottom of my list.
