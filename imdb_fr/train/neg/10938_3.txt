I did not expect much, but I'm still disappointed. This was my favorite Halestorm favorite favorite I've seen. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I was only laughing at 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling over and over again? What was going on with the concierge in the Heaven scene? Fred Willard was hilarious with some of his collaborations with Christopher Guest, but it did not work. They had to spend their entire budget to bring in "known" actors because there was no budget for lighting. It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. Is there really so much film to show that someone shoots and makes a basket, instead of cutting and editing a ball in a basket? I'm trying not to over-criticize low-budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to a real church basketball game instead of that movie.
