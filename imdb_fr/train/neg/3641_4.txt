Reminder: According to legend, Valkyrie Brunhilda defied Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by eternal fire. Only a pure-hearted warrior can pass through the flames, free Brunhilda and free her from Odin's claim and take her for himself. Now the war is getting ready in the Nordic countries and the king needs an alliance with the Berserkers. The Berserkers are warriors claimed by the Valkyries of Odin, coveted for war, blood and flesh, and therefore pariahs, but who are superior to combat. The leader of the Berserkers is a despised son of King Boar and his price for the alliance is his brother, the future king Barek. But after the king is victorious in battle, he refuses to abandon his last son, thus breaking his oath to Boar, betraying him and killing him. The boar is saved only by Barek's call to Odin. But this is just the beginning of the battle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to start now, a millennium later ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I was hoping this movie would be based on Viking terrain, far too few quality films on Viking have been made. The debut was very good too, with detailed sheets and armor, nice and well-adjusted landscapes and an OK battle. <br /> <br /> The base of Aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupt. Odin is a lot more vengeful, mean and absent than I remind him of school, and the valkyries have been turned into vampires-demons. I am not an expert, but it seems totally wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal mistake made by this film is to move the time setting from the initial period to today. If the two brothers had fought well at the right time, with some honest battles, the film would have been much better. Now the setting is suddenly changed in current Stockholm. Yet Odin is present and sends Boar and his berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek, which gives silly scenes of berserker sword fights in armor and painted with Barek among the industries. Beautiful mountains and woods were exchanged for cement. And when I was allowed to focus on simple fights, instead of massive fights as in the beginning, I quickly found that the fights and skills of the actors are slow and clumsy. The end result is a thin story, sometimes hard to follow and at other times just idiotic, and the only one who can save it, the action, is drawn from slow, boring and awkward sword fights. He draws very little from the Aesir myth or the Viking tradition. So, the story and the action fail and the movie is just bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, as a Swede, this film is a bit confusing. Expected to be shot entirely in South Africa, it still contains familiar Swedish signs, plaques and what appears to be an authentic police car. However, the efforts are mediocre and do not go far enough to really be in Sweden. No name is Swedish (maybe with Anya as an exception), no familiar scenery is Swedish, they speak (so-called) a little (old?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And the uniforms, both police and medical, are clearly not Swedish. If they did not even try to do it right - and really gave the illusion that it's happening in Sweden, why bother at all? <br /> <br /> 4/10
