Deceived by the terrible lie on the cover, "Fun as American Pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the television while waiting for a comedy ... and it is certainly not one. You will surely not laugh once if you are not one of those little Jackass spirits. It's not even an erotic film, which would have been at least something, since it's about sex ... So, what is it? The erratic plot is about a guy who wants to lose his virginity (zero in originality, I remember "Losing it" for one person) and his band of friends. The rest of the characters (that is, the girls) come and go without any credible reason. Come on, there are even dwarves (so simple: "The dwarves are funny ho ho" ...) The acting is very similar to that of the television (just like the look of the video throughout the film) and definitely amateur for most girls ... <br /> <br /> Awful movie. Amateur, poorly produced and especially NOT FUNNY. Children and teenagers will love to watch it with friends because of swear words and jokes about sex. Apart from that, do not even think about renting this movie.
