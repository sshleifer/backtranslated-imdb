This film deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic narration. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The biggest weakness of the film is its reluctance to engage in anything; it includes campist, moralistic and epic elements without ever engaging in any of them. As for the story itself, Chr√©tien de Troyes is turning in his grave in the face of this horrible adaptation that turns the innocent and unbearably innocent Percival into a very little rising and rude church. <br /> <br /> Two types of people will probably see this, francophiles or arthuriophiles. As one of these, I found the film unassailable and an incredibly shabby and disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
