Falls into the film category of "Much too ridiculous in the departments of dialogue and execution to be taken seriously". While Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday, the thirteenth or the back of my boyfriend know they are bad, Scarecrows does not know it. Evil Dead has set such a standard for comic horror on a low-priced genre, that Scarecrows is simply moved. <br /> <br /> Suspicions of inexperience are immediately at stake, as there is no trace of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an aircraft. The repeated display of a picture of 3 men screams just for a story, but nothing comes. Although men are obviously scarecrows, there is no explanation. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this film is too serious for its good, it can produce some smiles. I do not remember if Joe Bob Briggs has ever seen Scarecrows, but I do not think he would bend so low. However, with an IMDb rating of over 6, many people disagree.
