I watched this show and I just did not find it funny. It may have been the first episode. Lately, I realize that ABC plays a lot of stupid series nowadays and is becoming a station. All the characters in this series are very bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and the scenario are quite horrible and would still bring down the show. I would say that I think this show will be canceled, but since ABC is doing pretty badly for the quality of the programs they play, they could just keep this one just because it's average to them.
