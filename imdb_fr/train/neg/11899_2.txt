Robert Forster, a very strong actor, is a New York family man who seeks revenge for the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife during a home invasion. Scary topic exploited for cheapjack thrills in the vein "Death Wish". It is not hard to make fun of this tedious procedure: the dialogue is filled with howlers, the crime statistics are irreversibly dated and the secondary characters are ridiculously crushed (especially an ugly judge who allows an accused to be a murderer to get out of there, the courtroom). Low-rent production is despicable by its own justice, especially as violence in our cities has only intensified. * from ****
