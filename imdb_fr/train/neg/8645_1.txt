I just got back from this free screening and this "Witch Osama Project" is the worst film I've seen this year, worse than Catwoman's - which at least had the decency to pretend to be a fiction. <br /> <br /> In "September Tapes", a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" travels to Afghanistan - despite the fact that the journey, the conditions and the forgotten of the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta are perfectly prepared. The filmmaker wants to avenge the death of his wife on September 11 - to find Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They "made" eight videos during their trip, who now "document" their trip and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, thankfully, all end at significant points in the story, which suits a "documentary".) <br /> <br /> The psychotic and silly protagonist - to whom the long and meaningful speeches probably learned to watch "MacGyver" - does not care about his life or that of his innocent crew, as he puts them more and more at risk through a series of completely stupid incidents. I do not know why he did not carry a sign on his back saying "pull me on me." <br /> <br /> The crew translator, supposedly their reasonable voice, is only moaning. and becomes perplexed as the silly hero leads them to fate. <br /> <br /> You wish they had brought someone on their trip to call them all morons. <br /> <br /> Around "Tape 4", I started to incite terrorists to shoot at the film crew.
