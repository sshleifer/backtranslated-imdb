I have never really seen this movie, but I can tell you something about its production. Comedy DJ / radio oldies in 1988, I received a call from the production company. They asked me if I was writing and recording a bit, they would fall into the soundtrack as sounds from a television (the TV screen itself would never be shown). I said of course, writing a parody of 50s science fiction monster clich√©s, rounding out some of the sound effects, and calling on another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female role. As she was on the show at that time, she put on a long song, she joined me at the microphone of the production room and we cut the track in one take. Laughing, she then returned to her show while I mixed the wacky sound effects. We would never have done it if we had known that "Woodchipper Massacre" would become such a turkey - but again, we were never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
