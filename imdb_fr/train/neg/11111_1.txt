Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. Do not even get in your car and think you could see this movie if others do not like you. If you have to see a movie this weekend, go to Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to discover all the clues that honest police can not gather, and an innocent and too curious woman, but beautiful and strong with whom the public would like to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add a lot of poorly executed gore, and damn it, put some monsters there for a little "trick" of the plot. <br /> <br /> The game was horrible, and the incredible characters - Borat was more believable than that. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can anyone please tell me how a butcher's vest can ricochet a ball after being shot without even the person who was touched flinched ??? I am in the army. We need these things for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10, and I would place it in the decimals of this round to give it the lowest possible score.
