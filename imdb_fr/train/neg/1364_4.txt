the more I think about it, there was nothing that redeems this film <br /> <br />. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could have made it worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as a 4 on <br /> <br /> ten. <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie, I met the director. he seemed so distraught <br /> <br /> as to what he was doing or what he had done and, as far as I know, <br /> <br /> he did not care about the movie either . Even he acknowledged that he did not really know what he was doing and that he was forced to do certain things <br /> <br /> because the film was shot in digital. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the film was trying hard to integrate into the formula it was building for itself: "9 people must all be connected in a way or 'how can we go from point "A" to point "B" "so that we can move from the <br /> prostitute we see to the beginning and that we return to him at the end 10 minutes <br /> <br /> on the relationship of each character with another person. <br /> <br /> this gives the impression of being smothered by the two badly drawn, poorly drawn characters. <br /> <br /> I just remembered the redeeming part of the movie .. Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi there is a scene where he is incredible. that's all. as I said <br /> <br /> ... 4 out of 10.
