Time is precious. This film is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who love little movies like Fargo and this total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was full and everyone left with the same reaction: is this the movie that critics boast? What shit! <br /> <br /> The catchphrase of this film is the black girl in motion who seeks and finds her family of white garbage. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60-minute story. The characters are shallow and unintelligent. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not understand each other what was obviously obvious to the public; the audience was murmuring on the screen what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun doing the laundry.
