Looking at CBS 'Surrender, Dorothy', I was always wondering why Diane Keaton would like to be there (not because it's a TV movie - with the lack of seductive roles for slightly older actresses, it's not astonishing that Oscar winners performers such as Keaton are turning to television - but because it offers no opportunity for Keaton to shine). An unmarried mother, grieved by the sudden death of her twenty-year-old daughter, imposes the group of youngsters that her daughter was close at the time of her accident and gradually becomes friends with him. Adapted from the novel, this video game gives us a group of egocentric characters that we should avoid crossing the street. In addition to being rude and dark, these dummies are incredibly unconvincing, as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow located near the beach where the children live (a young man, wearing a muscle shirt to tell us that 'He's gay,' said Diane Keaton, 'Give up, Dorothy,' and asks, 'It's from The Wizard of Oz, is not it?' ... No, genius, it's "Citizen Kane"!) Keaton may have wanted to do this work based on the subject of confrontation with death, trying to turn this distinctly incomparable woman into a shadow of her own character (many crazy outfits) , but that's not going well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly friendly and flexibly flexible - she's a crazy harpy who does not learn much about her self-discovery journey (the movie quickly forgets that it is a young woman who died and becomes an odyss e to the nervous wreck of a mother, who seems to be too old hippie who never lost anyone close to it). This is the kind of film actors promoted in talk shows with the warning: "This should help many mourners out there." I can not imagine helping anyone because it's inherently depressing, confusing and confusing. It's disturbed.
