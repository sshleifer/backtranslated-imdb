This is one of two post-apocalyptic fantasy films directed by Albert Pyun in 1993 - and it's the bad one. Apparently, all his energy has been turned to "Nemesis", an entertaining and non-stop action movie, with a much more expensive look. "Knights" is awkward and corny, a barrel-backed science-fiction that too often resembles a video game (new opponents appear all the time and need to be exterminated as quickly as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the trash is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally effective fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, given his age at the time (58 years), I hope his double was well paid. (* 1/2)
