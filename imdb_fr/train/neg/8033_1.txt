In a college dormitory, a guy is killed by a fake. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later, she came out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend the break week with Hank and four other stupid friends in a big and beautiful condo in Florida. Naturally, the killer appears (for no reason) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> Null thriller slasher - a classic example of how it is forbidden to make a low budget horror movie. For starters, large parts of this movie are an infinite filling of these six idiots filming themselves, having fun (more fun than the public), getting drunk, behaving stupidly, etc., etc. I'm not saying that a horror movie needs nudity, but it would have been useful to animate it. None of the dead are really shown (you hear them), are only a little bloody and there is no blood. There is one REALLY horrible, but it's not over. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, the actor is nil. Dorie Barton is awful as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is bad as Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and he is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good - handsome and tough and gives it all to his shit. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role and does a very good job. <br /> <br /> Logical failures abound - after realizing that a friend was killed, two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's failure to see a friend killed is pretty funny and what's he going to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace in the end! Dull, stupid, no gore, no nudity - skip this one.
