I went to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The film failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> I do not mind just stories that extend credulity - do you remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect them to be internally consistent. This film jumps screaming howl, not moving to catch your breath, all intermingled with special effects well back from those of LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A mystic warrior from Korea, curiously metamorphosed Antiques dealer from the Caucasus and popping up like Deus ex machina to get the unlucky protagonists out of their last mess. A special FBI agent who seems to have mastered the ancient Korean folklore well because of the Fed's excellent "paranormal division" - which has not been noticed until now. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims "I never wanted that to happen." A couple reincarnated from long-dead Koreans who "died like cursed lovers." Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (who owe much to Peter Jackson's orcs), and a snake that loses so much time roaring that whenever its chosen prey is at hand, something distracts it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is appalling, the wooden play and the effect of the whole were, to be honest, tedious. However, for me, the coronation was at the end, after the finale, when the music of the closing credits was - Arirang! It's a bit like Akira Kurosawa closing "Ran" with a My Way karaoke performance - and let me say that I do not compare director Shim to Kurosawa in any way. <br /> <br /> In short, an indulgent individual, a dull collection of narrative clich√©s and non-narratives that may appeal to the melodramatic sense so prevalent in Koranic popular culture, but should not be worth the ticket price for a serious movie buff - or even a less serious movie buff. I would suggest that it completely bypasses the movie theaters and goes straight to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth it.
