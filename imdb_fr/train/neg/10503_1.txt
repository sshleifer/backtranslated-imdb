I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented the DVD Blockbuster .. In fact, I know one of the actresses of the film .. I will not say who ..! (It's hidden ..) But I must admit that it was not as good as I thought ... Tom Savini? Hat low for this guy .. But it's a pity that he is not in the movie for a long time .. What is missing in the film is the idea, the scenario, the sound, etc. It may sound like a good movie .. but it was not It's not entertaining .. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister paid Â£ 10 for the rental of 3 DVDs from Blockbuster .. I chose this one .. and I was disappointed. Anyway, congratulations for me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
