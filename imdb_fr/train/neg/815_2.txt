I just got the British special edition of Superman 1 to 4 discs for about $ 5. Additional items include the 1951 Superman and Mole-Men movies. So I slapped it in the DVD player last night, and here are my discoveries. <br /> <br /> A first disappointment - I had not checked, and I think I mentally labeled it as one of Kirk Alyn's soap operas. I'm not a big fan of George Reeves as a Superman, and I saw nothing but Kirk Alyn's strange music video - but damn it, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> This black and white production runs for less than an hour. This sounds like a few episodes of one of Reeves' first television series, a two-part document intended for theatrical release, although IMDb says the film was shot before the first TV series. In any case, it is a strange choice for reasons that I will discuss later. I am from an age where I remember television and film productions that are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there was no major surprise here. Nevertheless, for a low-budget film, this one is REALLY weak. <br /> <br /> The story is about the small town of Silsby - 1,430 inhabitants - which, oddly enough, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story begins with the well foreman taking precipitous steps to close the well. This conflicts with the arrival of the Metropolis, Kent and Lane reporters on the well, at the request of the oil company. While Clark detects the fact that the drill appeared in a radioactive cavern 6 km deep, some strange little guys (small, tall, blackhead, black trousers and bushy eyebrow) emerge from the cap . Drillshaft, and begins to mooch around the city with puzzled expressions on their faces. <br /> <br /> A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare the kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the city's creeping xenophobe) makes friends kill those "creatures". Superman intervenes (moderately inefficient) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's friends burn the house in which the other little friend hid and assume he was killed, but he escapes and drags him into the well. Corey urges a lynch mob (despite the sheriff's arrest) to suspend Mole-Man, hospitalized. Superman prevents them from entering the hospital and takes the wounded chappie to the well to bring him back to his comrades. A total of 4 mole-men emerge with a weapon of some sort that they shoot at Jeff Corey (I call this a Aargh gun!) Because his only effect seems to be to get Corey to "Aargh!") And Superman rescues him. . He immediately changes his behavior because of the surprise of Superman who saves him after his behavior, the men-moles descend in the well. The end. <br /> <br /> Although the film only lasts an hour, there is an inordinate amount of crawling, suspicious and pursuing. ensuring that no one follows him. The mole men are never engaged in any way - they do not dialogue - they introduce themselves, are persecuted and leave. They look a little gloomy, but it's not the monsters with insect eyes that the city's reaction implies. <br /> <br /> Reeves is a very good Clark Kent - a very tough journalist, much more than Lois Lane, rather indifferent at Phyllis Coates. But he's a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look at the part (at least his hair is dyed black, which is an improvement over the rather light hair he wore in some TV episodes), but his way of playing them is totally wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to "take the pose" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on the hips, no fists on the ribs . And he plays Superman as a rather strict and sensitive teacher - he does not really move his finger, but he could just as well have done it. <br /> <br /> And Superman walks a lot (I say a huge sum - he does not really participate) and runs a little. He takes off and lands several times, but never sees himself in flight. Oh, some bullets bounce him up and he uses telescopic vision like Clark, but without visual effect. In fact, the visual effects are remarkable by their absence, and the few that are present are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even according to these standards, I think it is a worn out effort. Fortunately, the production standards of the television series were higher and, at least, they took the trouble to offer stories that were a little closer to their heart. <br /> <br /> Something disappointing - I will not look at it again.
