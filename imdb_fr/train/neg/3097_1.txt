There can be no question of spoilers for this film, the director has beaten us all and ruined this film in so many ways. <br /> <br /> A flagrant scam of things like Critters and Gremlins, this film fails on so many levels to find the humor and horror of these better-made movies. This results in a shady loss of time, where bad actors give a bad dialogue in front of a stupid director, who throws them from time to time fluff. They struggle with these toys in the same way as the old Tarzan movies that used rubber crocodiles, shook them, screamed and did their best to make them slightly threatening. It is painful to watch, and not helped by the mental moods of the 80s worn by the actors. <br /> <br /> Roughly, some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by a security guard growing old in a lot of movies eventually break free after several years of detention and start taunting people's minds. . The new rookie guards, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, reunite his 80-year-old band of friends and go on minor adventures trying to win back Grem Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> All life is here, with a gang of jock Knucklehead, his girlfriend of the 80s, the icy girlfriend and pretentious hero, and the young hero lacking confidence in he and wishing his girlfriend to discontinue anyway. <br /> <br /> This is first of all the famous rifle fighting scene, where the former soldier shows how he was trained in the army to be a tough guy, pushing the hero Nerdy with the wrong end of rake for hours. Then there are some who run, ending up in a real pie-fighting style ending in a fuzzy nightclub with comic hand grenades exploding all except the people who are right next door. Then the movie ends, and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. It's like looking at a train wreck, you can not take it out of your eyes, it's so bad. A perfect rate for the Mystery Science Theater Theater, but it's terrible that you try to watch it alone and not cut. The fashion police still have a number of pending warrants for casting, and I challenge anyone not to laugh at the outright derision before the fight. This marks 2 out of 10 at most, a good day.
