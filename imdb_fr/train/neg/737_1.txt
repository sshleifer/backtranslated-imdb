WOW! <br /> <br /> I just got this movie from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt like he was caught! It's beyond boredom, most scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the acting is somewhat improvised, almost as if they had no script. Martians are CGIs, which seem to have been made by a novice or a film produced by fans. I can not emphasize how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: in one of the scenes, the Martians torture a local prisoner. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of this woman. The change is quite noticeable and when it is killed, you can see that it is a figurine, which looks like a game dating back to 1990! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie like the plague! You can download two trailers on their site and see how awful!
