I attended the screening of this film and, even if it had a few moments that made me laugh, it had very important defects. First, it presents itself as the humorous exploits of a real divorced woman seeking to find love in Los Angeles. It turns into a depressing, narcissistic and unusual adventure through the story of the director's romantic and professional life. The jokes wear out quickly and you suddenly find yourself indifferent to the progression of this man's appointments. The ridiculous thing is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and very flawed character and then expects us to be worried.
