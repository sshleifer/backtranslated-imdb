Best of the Best 4 is better than 3, but barely. Basically, I say this because Part 4 does not contradict Parts 1/2 (as does 3) (ie there is no reference to Tommy Lee having brothers and sisters). sisters). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked the Russian story plot, and in particular the role of Sven Ole-Thorsen in the role of Boris. Aside from that and some fighting scenes, the movie is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the scene of the explosion of an airplane). <br /> <br /> In addition, part 4 does not really have any morals or does not say anything like part 3, there are some other better known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but nothing is comparable to the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). <br /> <br /> Alas, it seems that the best of the best is the Rhee show, and to be honest, he can not wear a movie. <br /> <br /> Seen on cassette, Note: 4
