REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the rave reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a big pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would have laughed loudly and a lot, but I would have had an appointment with a former soldier. I could not hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think that my date, a "good old boy", liked. It's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work ... good for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful tease from Ralph. I vote a 2 only because Ralph looked so amazing. But I have to plead, Ralph, how could you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I'll watch the end of the case heal and recover now ... C1
