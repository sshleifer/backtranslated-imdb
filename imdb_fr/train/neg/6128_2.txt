This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some jokes and funny moments, but you can not base a movie on it! <br /> <br /> The characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes with bizarre side characters, which are not strange enough to make the plot true. because most actors are recognized in Hungary, a mystery why they took the roles. <br /> <br /> This is * not * a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring, even though it was supposed to be authentic or unique. They could have tried a lot harder than that ... 2 of 10
