Another series of films made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is like telling a story. In less than 15 minutes, the complete premise is presented in a few lines. There is absolutely no mystery, eliminating a whole facet of suspense. The only halfway competent actor is killed 10 minutes after the beginning of the film. So we are left with stupid characters who run and do stupid things. Low-budget movies can not afford expensive special effects, so CGI games are unsurprisingly unsuccessful, but at least a worthwhile attempt. The creature's costume is awful, as seen when it falls on the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which are not even the red color shown in the mirrored planes. The dialogue is awkward and uninspiring, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The latest action sequence takes place in a police station, also a Terminator scam, where everyone is hiding in the only glass-lined office in which the Darkwolf does not enter by force. In the end, the girl calls the hero "a good protector", but he gets his two partners, the original protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen policemen, all killed without having were shot down, despite an arsenal of bullets and a machine gun. But here's the real decisive for the bad writing: they could have killed the beast just after the opening credits when she held the stripper while throwing her red eyes. Instead, they took him into custody?!?
