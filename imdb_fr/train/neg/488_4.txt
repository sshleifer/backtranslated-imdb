A horrible movie! To be nominated for the Golden Globe, he had to face real stinkers. They took the story of the first woman painter of the Renaissance and mutilated her. My complaint is not that they took liberties with the facts; if the story was good, it would be fine. But it's just weird. Obviously, the true story of this artist would have made a much better movie, so why did they imagine this dull scenario? I guess there were not enough naked people in the factual version. It is precipitated at the end by a summary of the life of the artist. We could have spared a few hours if he had preferred the rest of the film with the same brevity.
