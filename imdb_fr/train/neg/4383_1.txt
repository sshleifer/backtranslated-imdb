The worst Bob Hope comedy of all time (and this includes strong competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl "steering her boat". Someone has certainly directed this Hope piracy over the cliff, as it stars Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can not make people laugh or excite. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
