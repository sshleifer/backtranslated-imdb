It was not the major disaster I expected, but it's about as positive as I can in my description of the film. I'm not sure what was supposed to be funny in this film, but I guess everything is a matter of taste. Personally, I do not find it funny to watch morons live their idiotic lives or ridicule themselves on TV, but again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic talk show during the day. I did not get bored watching this, but I never liked it either. If you want to see a bad movie, but not too painful, it's a good choice.
