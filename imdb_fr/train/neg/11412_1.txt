This movie is so bad, you can not imagine. The acting is terrible, even worse than in third-class soap operas. It is unfortunate that this film was the most successful of the last 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between the soldiers made no sense. The story could have been taken from a bravo photo story, the dialogues were as woody as Treebeard and the holes in the plot were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But nowadays, it does not take much to satisfy the public. The actors were beautiful, for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even suspended (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. It's really cool guy! Especially for teenagers 12 and 13 years old. But the media has created an atmosphere in which you have not been allowed to reject the film because they have manipulated the dynamics of peer groups by implicitly saying that you are a geek if you do not associate with each other " sheep "and do not say it. exactly what it was like when I was in the army / that's exactly what I'm going to do when I have to go to the army ... to all the nerdy actions that have to do with drugs and blood- cold. And do not think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning the toilet with a toothbrush (which I had to do because I offended a lieutenant) It is not necessary that all movies are sophisticated. Sometimes we only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget the problems, and I think that's not a bad thing. But this type of film influences teens a lot by showing them a cool lifestyle that, in fact, is only stupid and turns them into ignorant and egocentric idiots without brains. But as I'm not very popular, I'll be quiet now and I recommend you avoid this horrible movie at all costs and do it to save yourself! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
