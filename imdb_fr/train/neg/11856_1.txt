I just saw this film last night at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and I seriously wonder if the festival people actually watched the movies before selecting them. The movie was just horrible - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was horrible. The years of Matthew Modine as a leader are well over. Gina Gershon wore an inexplicable and useless English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a strange little cameo - she should be ashamed. The script was terrible and we were not given any reason to worry about the characters. I strongly doubt that it will be resumed, but again, people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes. I really think that "Kettle of Fish" is a serious contender for the worst film I have ever seen.
