OK, the representation of "Indian" stereotypes in this story is simply FALSE. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but yes, her skin color seems to change during the movie. I thought, OK, ... it has never been this tan in real life. It's one of the most obvious 'Indian' makeup I've ever seen. It's as bad as the "Indians" of "F-Troop" and the old Hollywood westerns played by American Jewish and Italian actors and not real American Indians! <br /> <br /> This film is ok, but lame story and mediocre songs, as in all subsequent movies of Elvis. He just made them because Colonel Parker had linked him to long-term contacts with a movie to get the most money out of Elvis! I can not stop thinking, thank God, that Elvis stopped making movies shortly after the release of this movie. It's good to see actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, Jones L. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this film, however. <br /> <br /> The "Indian" makeup of Burgess Meredith is absolutely AWFUL. This is the worst of the group for sure. What did the filmmakers think? Was Mr. Meredith doing just that for the money or what? I like some Elvis movies, though. For example, "Love Me Tender", "Jailhouse Rock", "Viva Las Vegas". I can even stand to watch his movie with future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, "Change Of Habit" in which Elvis plays the role of a downtown doctor. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Elvis DOES SOME good movies, but the mediocre and the bad ones crush the good ones and the good ones. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you very much!
