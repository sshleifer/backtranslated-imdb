Despite the positive reviews and projections at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to that of other films, in which a teenage girl of the immigrant family has to overcome many common personal conflicts. problems of his age, and also to fight the pressure of ethnic traditions in his family. She does this by choosing a kind of sport and with the help of a boy from the area, who falls in love with her for some reason, she confronts her problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight, it's boxing, in Plie it like Beckham, it's football and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But Fighter is a product much inferior to these two, it was just embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, "the actress" who plays the role of a teenager may be able to do a lot of things, but one thing she can not do is act. Her on-screen presence is anemic and clumsy, dramatic situations in which she tries to show emotions, are awful, her body and facial language are amateur actress poorly educated by the director. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but they simply can not save this cliche movie with stereotypical characters and a superficial plot. In addition to some good times, this movie is not new or interesting to offer. <br /> <br /> Even kung-fu fights are not a reason to look at this, it's so boring. The idle was really useless, the choreography was basic and uninspired, and most of the kung-fu scenes were just training or standing in all kinds of kung fu positions, without fighting. Not to mention ridiculous when a skinny little girl fights big, muscular boys and makes them fall from their feet. <br /> <br /> This film has been noticed only because it is European. It's very easy to get to know this movie - A first Danish martial arts movie, but make no mistake, this is not the case. It's just a drama about a stupid teenager and her problems, which are not really convincing. <br /> <br /> Bad film with embarrassing lines, games and history.
