SPOIL ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams' life. I think it would be nice to know why William was motivated or forced. I think the secret service members are everyday people a member of the secret service, now his motives are clear, well known.But as a rental, this movie will not satisfy you, to wait until the end. Clark Johnson as director of SWAT does a much better job like this time, and I always wonder how the producers (eg Michael Douglas) left this film in theaters.
