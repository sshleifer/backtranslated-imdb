Sean, you know, I think you're absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can not congratulate you. Comedy is just not your forte. <br /> <br /> However, not everything is your fault. Some things were too difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to wonder where the replies come from. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I'm sorry.
