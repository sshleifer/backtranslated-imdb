Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) makes this well-meaning but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) trying to connect his science niece (Ryan) to an ordinary man, Tim Robbins, to relax and enjoy life in the world. 1950s. For Ryan to love Robbins, Einstein tries to make him look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls flat with silly situations and silly dialogues. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the excellent support cast are doing their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to save the film. It is unfortunate that so much talent has been devoted to producing such a dull film. I would not recommend anyone unless you're a big fan of Meg Ryan.
