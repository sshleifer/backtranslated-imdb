I did not like this movie at all! First of all, I do not know why, but everyone here says that the game of Clémence Poésy is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! She is not like Natasha: another apparition, another character ... Worse, she is a very inexperienced actress and that's why she was not able to play this role! She completely disfigured the heroine! It was really disgusting to watch her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to entrust this role to a Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunk man who has not shaved for two weeks and who has conquered a battle in which he has lost an eye ... (Thank God, in this film, there are actors whose play was great! Alessio Boni did a great job, I was pleasantly surprised and one of the few people to read the book, which is very important for the play. Only thing that I liked in this job was beautiful views and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand the true meaning, the purpose with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps to realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
