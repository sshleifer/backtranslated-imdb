Once again the same familiar story of a man (writer here) who sells his soul to the devil to have his most desired ambition in life: success. Unfunny scenario (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the message "strong" "Christian" (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a a very long stage show at the end where Agent Hopkins beats the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is neither sexy nor perverse) for all the bad things she has done to this inimitable character. This is not a bad effort on the part of the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall in a role of "Sex and the City", Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Also try an unpopular Greek film called "Alloimono stous nous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man gives his soul to the devil to find his youth)
