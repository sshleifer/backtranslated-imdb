I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent. <br /> <br /> I am perverted. <br /> <br /> I usually see a bad movie and a curse. It was so bad that I made a criticism to try to save the others from the completely boring disorder of which I am a victim. <br /> <br /> I break my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> It's too lame even to use an open room. So boring. Watch "Bloodsucking Freaks" or "Shock, shock, shock" for an absolute shit that has merit as entertainment. This mud looks horrible, it's awful, and anyone who made it should feel awful.
