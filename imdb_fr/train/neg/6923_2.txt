Absolutely dreadful Mexican film allegedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a journalist who would like to go to the compound of an asylum hidden in the woods to write how it works, etc. When our hero, Gaston, given the great spectacle of Dr. Maillard, responsible for the asylum, we see all kinds of things supposedly horrible, such as men trailing in a dungeon, and comic, such as our hero is joked by soldiers as he goes down a ladder suspended above a building. Then there is a show that could have been supposed to be both: a man dressed in chicken, yes, that's right, a chicken pecking on the ground to feed on chicken. The scene was supposed to be a comical moment in the film, but, at least for me, it was the lowest and most revolting point of the film when you consider that adult men and women think it might even be distracting. Ah! This is indeed the true horror of Dr. Tarr and his legion of name changes. And that brings me to this salient point about the movie: Most movies that undergo multiple title changes usually have a serious problem. Yes, it's obvious, but some have distribution issues and others, including this one, have many title changes, so that someone can unwittingly buy the same garbage more than once . It's really garbage. He has very little success. The only artist who deserves to be examined is Claudio Brook, head of asylum. He is a huge piece of ham as he laughs, manic, orders of bellows, sashays with sword in hand and praises the chicken. I was so tired of hearing about the "soothing system" as a way of healing the mentally ill. What a ridiculous band (Hey, a movie like this with a scenario like this deserves that kind of word). It will not take you long to understand what is happening at the asylum and it will not be any more interesting. Cinematic chicken scratch!
