It was a disappointing film. Considering the content - life in the army is always good to laugh - and the stars, this film should have been a laughing day. It was at best a few chuckles. Steve Martin was a lot funnier than that and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles, where he could follow the example of Robin Williams and possibly win an Oscar.
