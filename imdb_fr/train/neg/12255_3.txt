... which is not exactly a resounding endorsement. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Of course, in this movie, Matt Borlenghi played a whole bag that spent the whole movie crying about the fact that his little brother was eaten by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the intrigues were better and the acting was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) the killer crocodile looks like a child model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. are wrecked on a deserted island, where they meet a rabid group of filthy Filipinos who are trying to force themselves to the women of the group. Which was a total loss of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough fang time. "Blood Surf" has some reductive qualities - the actresses are very attractive and Matt Borlenghi is devoured by the fang towards the end of the film. But if you're on your death and you only have time to watch a film by Matt Borlenghi / Killer Crocodile, ignore it and run "DinoCroc" instead.
