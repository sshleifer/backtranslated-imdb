Previously, I did not know that in the early 1990s, Devry University (or was it ITT Tech?) Had added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical programs. Well, this film has to be the product of the class adept at criticism. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the back of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Horribly horrible. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds two main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman dreamed of the Boogeyman and his victim in the first film. More than 50% of this film comes from the original film. The rest of the film is the main character who has bad dreams while his therapist buzzes on a narrator. These scenes are filmed through a filter so thick that the characters shine. Angela Lansbury would look 25 years old. So, to recap, frightful. Do not watch this movie.
