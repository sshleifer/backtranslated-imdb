I only gave this comic horror movie with the ridiculous title 2 because many famous porn stars from the past are there. A group of tourists, supposedly on holiday in Ireland but in Canada, followers of a cannibal consanguin mutant, and the plot is more or less the opposite of THE HILL HAVING Eyes and WRONG TURN. The only problem is that, unless I'm mistaken, there is only one mutant exposed, and it's not as impressive. A bit like the tummy mummy in this homemade movie of about five years ago. Some bloody but ridiculous deaths help, but the film is strictly amateurish and boring. The end is predictable and has been made to death. No pun.
