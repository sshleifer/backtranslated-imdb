This film is ridiculous. Anyone who says that the acting is great and that the cast is superb has never seen a cinema, even mediocre. The acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I think all the other "slender" comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers. I was not very impressed by the screenplay, but I just wanted to see some beautiful Oregon scenery, and there was good cinematography - but the casting was all that was inspired. I think this film also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in Native American culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving it is useful and possible. He puts the jokes in the wrong and obvious places, and makes me think that he was written by the State Department or something like that. Back to the drawing board. Even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same neighborhood as classics like Harold and Maude is absolutely late, and follows the same line of begging, pretense and "joke" as the one that rages in this film.
