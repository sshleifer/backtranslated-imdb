Cartoon Network seems to be desperate for evaluations. From the cancellation of Samurai Jack, the network seemed to want to remove all the programs that made it so popular, such as Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab, Dragonball Z, and so on. When odds began to fall, CN began to perform poorly. Although Total Drama Island / Action and Chowder are distinguished by their intelligent writing and gimmicks that appeal to the public, there are many other shows that offer either terrible remakes (George of the Jungle) or scams from other shows, such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, where the main character acts exactly like Spongebob, then Johnny Test, which replaces Dexter's lab, though it is a real scam. <br /> <br /> The characters in the series are clearly derived from Dexter's Lab, but this time, the focus is on Johnny, a blond (or fiery-haired) character who annoys his twin sisters, Susan and Mary, who HAPPEN to look like Dexter, orange hair to glasses, technology impossible. There is even a rival genius, Bling Bling Boy or Eugene, who seems to be replacing Mandark. Then there's Dookie, the best friend and dog who talks about Johnny, one of the Dexter ... I mean, the first experiences of Susan and Mary. <br /> <br /> Dexter's lab was probably one of the best cartoons on television, with its simplicity, but an effective artistic style, an adorable main character and episodes that do not seem to be long in coming. Johnny Test is very different. The artistic style here is not so attractive. In fact, it seems absolutely horrible. The characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive. As in most episodes of the series, Johnny and Dookie seek to sow chaos in the neighborhood girl, Sissy, whom Johnny secretly loves, or the twins' obsession with a boy next door. Seeing these two geniuses vanish at the sight of abs and the fact that Johnny seems to be someone with whom we would NEVER associate, there is no real link between the viewer and the characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that the Johnny series is Susan and Mary's guinea pig for their experiments. These will turn Johnny fat, ugly, monstrous and even a woman. The twins then help Johnny, no matter what scheme he plans in exchange for his services. Whenever there is an episode involving this kind of "win / win" chord, it is usually defeated in the open and those who do not completely get off the rails never finish satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The writing varies from mediocre horrible, however. The episode "fat" constantly repeats "It's Phat with a PH, there is a difference, you know." which is a line that should never be repeated, especially when the episode seems to PROMOTE childhood obesity, with Johnny becoming a famous star with money and video games just by getting fat. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about how the show not completely rip off Dexter's Lab. The series is composed of two characters named MM. Black and White, a military general who seems to need to solve all his problems through Johnny and his sisters, and MANY super-bad guys, though here, the show still steals ideas for other sources, like a clone of Mr. Freeze, an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over the man (like Powerpuff Girls' devilish cat), a maniacal brain, a wicked trio of skaters and even a mole-man, who is probably the most cliche villain in the media. <br /> <br /> To top it off, besides its ugly animation and unimaginable characters, passable dubbing (like the voices of Mr. Black and Mr. White) in the blink of an eye (Johnny, Dookie and just about all the bad guys in the series). The theme song seems to be the only catchy thing about this show, but it was then redone in a few episodes with a band that just spoiled it. <br /> <br /> So in the end, Johnny Test is not good cartoon. Her horrendous references and jokes about teenage culture will dismantle the small children's interest in the series, while her vivid colors, ripped characters and dragging episodes will spoil the teenagers' experience. It's just another of those shabby series that Cartoon Network is promoting too much to get people to watch it (like MTV for rap). If you need a program that satisfies your children for half an hour, you'd better stick with Spongebob because Johnny Test is more of a "test" of patience than anything else.
