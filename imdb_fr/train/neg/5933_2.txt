I'm a fan since his first album. This film does him a disservice. The performances, with the exception of Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Those of Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even that of the McGarrigle sisters was ruined by the alleged harmony of Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I never saw my wife get up and leave the room with a movie before and I found myself quickly. performance retransmission to access the few interview segments, which were also hard to watch due to the poor work of the camera. <br /> <br /> Many people were able to interpret Mr. Cohen's songs: Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson, but these people were chosen for this performance. Awful. <br /> <br /> Hopefully there will be another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen in a film that will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad.
