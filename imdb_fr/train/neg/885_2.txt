An anthology is always a risky affair and I think this effort needs to be praised. There is a lot of talent involved here. A large number of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really appreciate this film based on three problems I encountered. <br /> <br /> First, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately, some face each other. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments seem to me underdeveloped. Like seeds of good stories that never materialize. I'm not talking about a happy ending here (or even the end of period) but rather lack of basic development or even solid configurations that attract you. <br /> <br /> Finally, I did not feel New York and its people were properly represented. <br /> <br /> All you have left are head-length shorts that may still interest some but leave the average viewer unhappy.
