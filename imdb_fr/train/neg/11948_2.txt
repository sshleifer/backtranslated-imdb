Horrible looting of a classic. <br /> <br /> It was not convincingly written why Mary had to develop such sympathy for Bates. He may be more stable until they start joking with him, but he does not use it at all for his actions. (Inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his motel until recently decommissioned, telling his attractive girl her mental past, lying about knives, etc.) that, in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely suspicious of him, but that does not just happen to be able to play the game of "murder-identity-murder-identity" later. Which in itself is also ridiculous: "So-and-so is the real killer - more so too! There were too many artificial twists to project a story on screen while the story did not need to be extended. <br /> <br /> It was good to see Perkins reissue his famous role, but that's about the only pleasure you feel. This is certainly not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you do not intend to get closer, you should not bother at all.
