Should I say - it's a whore! (I gave it a score of 2) <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you have insomnia. <br /> <br /> There are many landscapes to chew and hammer, but not much else happens in this film. There is no suspense, no deep and shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the well-being of the heroine. Some disagreements, a slight elevation of voice, that's about all. Secrets are nothing that can not happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the movie is totally predictable at that time. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it is, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), artist, is engaged to paint a series of wall panels in a huge ballroom located in a vast manor house by a very, very rich woman, widow and widow, and a growing mother-daughter relationship. an older woman longs with her. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this woman's daughter, Cassandra, is dead. You can very well assemble the rest of the pieces. <br /> <br /> Even the scene of the mysterious man who threatens our heroine does not advance to the point of making you fear for his safety beyond a second or two. Why does he stay around, a few years after Cassandra's death? It's a good question. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of the fact that in this vast house there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything - cook, clean, serve meal, answer the door, etc. Everything except apparently locking the door - since that would be the only explanation of how one of the characters enters a room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that makes you grab the arms of your chair and lean forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no tension "rising" in this film - just tasteless and pathetic revelations that are thrown from time to time. <br /> <br />
