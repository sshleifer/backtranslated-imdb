This should be my kind of movie. Even if it was fearful, it should have been fair in my driveway; damn good, I like the movies "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine". I have a weakness in my heart for the stupid movies of alien / demon / adventure. Let's see why I decided to look at this in the first place. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Science-fiction almost always intrigues me 2. I am a big fan of archeology and this film has a rare treasure. 3. Super natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf generally appeal to me. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but the boy did it. Slater and Dorf are the only redeeming aspects, and not everyone thinks they're as entertaining as me ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But let's move on to some of the many mistakes. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Even though the film as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really horrible. We're not just talking badly, I'm talking about the appointment of Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I do not know if she is able to act, but playing at the museum curator is simply out of her league ... completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist was not much different from what you get by watching the staging in the bad porn. I mean it's not just bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those who are curious, she does not undress, she only has a bra in a ridiculous and totally useless love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with Reid's performance, the movie might have worked, but it's the plot that dominates, and the plot seems to be written by a 10-year-old. I did not realize it was a video game adaptation before watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds from Slater's childhood in an orphanage where he receives memories of something terrible happened. He suffers from amnesia, of course. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by a 713 unit, a paranormal military force that apparently drives out evil or something like that. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never really know unless it's in one of those voice-overs that I've zoned for. The film begins with Slater's hunting artifacts, getting his last piece after some relations with a "Chilean mercenary force specializing in the sale of rare antiques". The exact quote may be wrong, but you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> There is a devilish doctor who wants to unleash demons on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demons / aliens - human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (the demon does not not support sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even be forced to wade the clich√©s. The script badly needed to be reworked to clarify the subject and provide depth. I mean, why is this diabolic scientist so evil? Oh yes, humans are doomed and he's just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did it happen? Oh yes, he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws his blood to shoot himself. How did it go? Why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they're using old sci-fi stuff with extraterrestrial parasites / demons that "merge" with their host's spine) Of course, Slater is, like Blade, The half slug was fed, but its slug "did not rocket completely because of an electric shock", thank you god. Oh, and people with these "fused" spines, have no idea that they are half aliens / demons and act like good members of the community until a secret signal is given from where they become deadly zombies. Yes, we have zombies. <br /> <br /> There is so much bullshit that could be fun, but none of that. <br /> <br /> In addition, the end is completely stupid, because everything turns out to be no big deal to repair in the first place ... at least nothing that a little dynamite can handle. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst thing you will see, but a really bad movie.
