There are similarities between "Jindabyne" by Ray Lawrence and his last film "Lantana" ?? a corpse and its repercussions on already dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered some hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything that has not been resolved, which will leave most viewers dissatisfied, even deceived. <br /> <br /> The story - the consequences of discovering a floating corpse in an isolated river - is based on a story by Raymond Carver. It became part of Robert Altman's classic "Short Cuts" in 1993. Lawrence uses this theme to explore and expose relationships within a small Australian community under pressure. The film asks some moral questions "Would you let the discovery of a corpse spoil your good weekend?" and more poignant for Australians "Would it make a difference if the deceased was an Aboriginal?" The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by obsessing music, a bit like "Picnic at Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all this sounds like the basis of a good movie, get ready to drop, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown early, eliminating the element of mystery. So we end up with those sorry lives and an empty finale.
