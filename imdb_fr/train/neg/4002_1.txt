The social commentary has been exaggerated and the mystery itself is constructed and solved through a series of incredible and totally incredible coincidences. In Fitz's personal life, nothing has changed in the last decade, which makes it so interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had a hard time understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia about the opportunities to solve mysteries he has in England. Can not he sneak into the Australian police? This seems to be a very contrived conspiracy to involve him in a criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the original series were rather melodramatic and improbable, sometimes bordering on stupidity, and this one takes this coat rather than returning to the center of the first series. Sad.
