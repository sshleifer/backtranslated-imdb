Oh dear! The first time I heard about this bad series was when one of my friends was screaming like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while we were playing video games. I thought he was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life), and changing the "Quest" with "Test." That's something weird that I'm wrong, but in fact I was wrong, he did not change anything, he had heard about this show. <br /> <br /> One day while I was watching TV, I heard to say that Cartoon Network was going to be released, I was not sure, what was the plot of this show, so I ventured to watch it, and here is my answer: "I WANT MY DAMN TIME TO RETURN" (Because I looked at this shit and "My gym partner is a monkey". <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. beginning, with the world's stupidest song, then the plot ... Oh, where are my manners? I did not say the plot of this show It's about a boy who has to make sisters EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT ES, who have a lab and do experiments with their own brother. You know, honestly, Miss Dexter's miss me b (before it turned into NEW Dexter, a total crap too). It's a bad copy of this good old show, except that this show is incredibly bad. Do not look, do something more productive in this half hour than watch this shit.
