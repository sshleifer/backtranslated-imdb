God, what a dreadful thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something like that (see the awful use of music and pictures here), but why? All that lies behind "Natural Born Killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how the media can turn into a real trash, but unfortunately the film turns into a real trash. Please, Mr. Stone, next time you want to criticize the fascism of TV series using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same thing with your movie! Michael Haneke said very intelligently about this film that he denounced the fascism of the media with fascist film means. As it is true ... Only, he forgot to tell us about the massive headache that you feel after having gone through this load of shit too long!
