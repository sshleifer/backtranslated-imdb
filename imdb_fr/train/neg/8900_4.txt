I liked the first movie, but it is a classic example of a suite that would have been better to stay on the drawing board. The general idea in the first film was, if not great, at least very interesting. This sequel tries to develop the idea and the characters of the first film, and although Christopher Walken is always good like Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a little ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these movies yet, get the first movie and forget the sequels, they can deprive you of all the joy of the original.
