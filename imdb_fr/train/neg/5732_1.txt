I'm all for a "bad" horror movie, but it was just a bunch of sh dogs! T! How everyone can call this cool or decent film exceeds me. If you like a rushed edition to cover the special effects, a bad interpretation and a bad script, then go for it! There was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so wrong. I will take Hostel or Wolf Creek on this pile every day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows a stinky when she sees one. On the other hand, I was stupid throughout the movie just to wait and see if it was getting better. No chance! I have not seen his other Torched yet, and I doubt I'll worry about it now.
