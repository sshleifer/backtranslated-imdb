There were many very great horror movies produced in the seventies, but this film is certainly not one! Too bad that The Child is not better, because it is based on a decent idea taking into account some themes of horror sometimes successful. We have the idea of ​​an avenging child, who worked so well in classic movies like The Bad Seed, and then we have the central theme of zombies, which of course has been the backbone of many horror movies in success. The plot is basically the following: a young girl reproaches many people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to take revenge (as you do). All this is fine, except that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and even if it ends well with a little gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting around the rest. The film was obviously shot within the limits of a budget, the places look cheap and all the actors are garbage. I really can not say much about the film as a whole, because there is not much to do. The Child is a horror movie of the 70s and I certainly do not recommend it.
