I also saw this film during its screening at the High Falls Film Festival in New York, and I must say that I found it boring and complete. Although it was funny in some places, the only real laugh was that there seemed to be a real plot to tell and that playing in some places was awful and wooden, especially the "Belle Dame" and the voice of the narrator never heard of) had a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac was, in my opinion, the redeeming feature of this film, a real action and courage and (outside the casting) the only real role. I'm sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the staging, it could have been a half-decent movie. Just hope that it is not sent in general version, or if you really want a copy, look in the basket of good deals Lidl.
