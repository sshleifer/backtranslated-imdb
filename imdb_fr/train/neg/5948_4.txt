I will not mention any of the plot, because, although it is highly predictable, the only noticeable rebound is given everywhere, in the movie's comments, in the plot summary here, and even in the envelope summary from Netflix. I might have liked more if I had not known that. May be. This film has a deceptively good cast, most of which have played credibly with the relatively limited material they have, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren, Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller roles. It was impossible to love William McNamara, but it was clearly wanted. And there were some quick nude scenes of the callipygian Lenore Zann. But none of this brings any recommendation from me. None of these good actors read these scripts before signing?
