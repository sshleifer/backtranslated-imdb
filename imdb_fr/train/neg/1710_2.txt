From time to time, a group of friends, with a minimal budget, but tons of enthusiasm and talent, creates a low-budget masterpiece that storms the world of horror. Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and his friends managed with Bad Taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made money with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Director Todd Sheets and his comrades, however, are bound to sink into relative darkness forever if the Zombie bloodbath is a bargain. A lesson on how not to make cheap horror, this miserable effort (on a plague of flesh-eating zombies - natch) reminds us that while many people nowadays have access to a video camera, most should not take that made them want to try to make a feature film. <br /> <br /> It's not that Sheets does not have the eye for a well-framed shot (some of her camera angles and movements are actually pretty good), but rather than a) he has a lousy scenario b) he has a lousy cast, and c) he does not realize that he has a lousy storyline and cast. Which means that the final movie is extremely amateurish and is unlikely to be viewed entirely by people other than zombie movie completers (like me) or cast members and crew (like those who gave favorable comments to the film). <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at gore dogs without distinction, and Sheets (who currently has an incredible 34 titles as a director) is doing everything possible to please, with buckets of offal and blood thrown at every opportunity. But, although these moments are undeniably disgusting, they are not particularly convincing and quickly become tedious. <br /> <br /> It is therefore a very bad film, almost without reducing characteristics. Apart from two: <br /> <br /> First, he presents the largest mullet in the film's history, as wore Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The magnificence of its mosquito net (associated with an attractive mustache) is just one reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it contains "pathetic stealth zombies": carnivorous corpses watch for unfortunate victims to roam by, before jumping from their hiding place to launch a weak attack, which requires almost no effort to escape at. Better known to have been hiding behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it, "pathetic stealth zombies" also sometimes hide behind walls or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Normally, a movie that bad would have 1/10 for me, but, to celebrate Jerry Angell's fluid locks, I'll generously raise my rating to 2/10.
