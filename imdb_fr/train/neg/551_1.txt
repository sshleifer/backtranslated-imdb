I have gone through AFI's list of the 100 best comedies, and I must say it's really one of the worst. Not just the 90 films I've seen, but all the movies I've seen. Drunkards are sometimes funny, Dudley no. Liza was almost worth it, but alas ... just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny? I would highly recommend ANY OTHER movie in AFI's top 100 comedies for more laughs. If you want to see a funny "drunk", try The Thin Man. Funny movie in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you're intoxicated like Arthur).
