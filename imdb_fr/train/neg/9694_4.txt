Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story. The gypsy Jean Seberg and his widowed father, also bohemian, David Niven, on vacation in the south of France with the hazelnut Mylène Demongeot. Things are going well until the friend of the Deborah Kerr family shows up. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, has too much trouble resisting Kerr's conquest. This suits Seberg as long as Niven loves him and leaves him (as he did with all the women of his past ... including Demongeot). When it seems that she becomes the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg takes revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story as a flashback from Seberg's point of view and cleverly combines black and white with more sunny scenes of color. The cinematography of Georges Périnal is magnificent. The film presents some of Preminger's lighter directions, though it rarely allows close-ups, making it difficult to understand what the actors actually feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the screenplay and is full of acid dialogues and fun scenes (mostly bird-like Demongeot). Seberg does pretty well, but Niven is at least attractive ... and he shows no chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger is really wrong with this casting. It's a role that seems tailor-made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as potential contender for Seberg and Martita Hunt as his mother daffy. Juliette Gréco plays herself and sings the title in a Parisian discotheque. The headlines are Saul Bass, a regular at Preminger.
