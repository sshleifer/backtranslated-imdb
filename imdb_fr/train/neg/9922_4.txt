Growing up, Joe Strummer was one of my heroes, but even that film left me cold. For better or for worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a documentary style "Behind Music". It is more of a biographical film, filled with interviews, performance sequences, home movies and, most importantly, useless animation drawings from "Animal Farm". The film is coherent but lasts about half an hour. <br /> <br /> The format of the campfire, although touching in thought, is actually quite boring in performance. First of all, without a title, it is difficult to know who is half of the respondents. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack licking their buttocks about this man? They were irrelevant to Strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story. <br /> <br /> This image is at its best when Strummer, through recorded interviews and conversations, touches on facets of his life that most people did not know. about: the suicide of his older brother, accept the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. For me, it was very moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as a punk icon we all knew and loved, but as an ordinary human being confronted with the joys and sorrows of life to which we owe all face. <br /> There have been better, simpler documentaries on Strummer and The Clash. (These include Westway, VH1 Legends and MTV's MTV documentary from the early '90s.) Joe Strummer: The future is unexpressed and is reserved for the hard-core.
