I must admit that I am a big fan of this show. So you must know how disappointed I was to see this movie. First, the plot was terrible, I thought it would be something more interesting, like to see what happened to Arnold's fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy the Arnold's house, among many other places, so many people are trying to stop this. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the plot was not so bad after all, but what was really bad was the steps that Arnold and his friends are doing to stop this maniac, they become friends. 'a spy ,; they drive a bus (based on a video game, for God's sake) and, worse yet, they make great movements on the bus, things that many people had already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, because they are video game experts. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my mom, my sister and I were really disappointed after watching this movie because it was the worst way to end a good cartoon. I have to admit that I used to appreciate "Hey Arnold!", It was one of my favorite Nickelodeon cartoons, but after that movie bullshit, I'm not quite sure I'm watching " Hey Arnold! " as I used to look at the past. <br /> <br /> Another thing Nickelodeon, with this huge number of dynamite, I can assure you that not a single street would explode, I think the whole city could explode with that Oh, and please If all your future good cartoons are going to be like this, do not make more movies, you give a bad review to cartoons that were good before. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think it was the worst way to end this show, a good show turned into this shit movie.
