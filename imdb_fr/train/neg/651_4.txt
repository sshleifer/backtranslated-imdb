I saw this movie a few days ago and I jumped during the scary parties. I have to admit I found it pretty decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters were saying. Logical Problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a rather fit guy, makes no noise during his assassination. Do not you think he would at least have tried to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the remark is made that the gym teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa", I almost screamed on the screen. When your best friend's family was murdered by a teacher who loved him, you do not make comments like this if you have half of your heart. <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks his uncle how many exits he has in the house and the uncle notices there might be a danger, would not it be wise to Donna, her boyfriend, aunt and uncle in a car? drive far, far, then start the house with the HRT and the police so that the killer has no way out? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And on. And on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not profiled enough so that you felt some empathy after their massacre and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> ALWAYS. <br /> <br /> This movie could be good for teens or young couples looking for a fun night out. If you do not consider all gaffes, it's a mediocre film.
