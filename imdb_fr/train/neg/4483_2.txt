I admit that the first I liked and that I looked forward to the continuation. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. Of course, the special effects were incredibly technical, but they were not incredible. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit I love 80% of the hunting scene - but the fight with all Mr Smith? It was obviously animated too. <br /> <br /> I can accept all that. What I can not accept is that the no-action games were shit. Whenever Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that I was in a speech that lasted forever and meant nothing. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the little plot that existed. What this film did is tell us that there was no truth in the first film (except on the existence of the matrix). This film was a bit like seeing the episode of DALLAS where you discover that the whole previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want my $ 7.00 back!
