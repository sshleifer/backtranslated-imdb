Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was extremely disappointed by the wooden play and the arrogance of the producers in their flagrant disregard for the plot. I think this film does not reflect the brilliance of Bronte's work, but rather gives the impression of a superficial love affair. By condensing the film in two hours, the film has lost many of the key features that make the book understandable and evolving, giving rise to a somewhat jerky and unfounded plot. The relationship between Rochester and Jane Eyre has not been put in place. This seems rather abrupt and unfounded, because the interactions between the two characters are so rare that you can not help but imagine that their "love" is superficial. It's such an injustice for Bronte's novel: you do not get any impression of Jane's bizarre cheek and daring that draws Rochester towards her, nor of her arrogance that draws her to him. <br /> <br /> Despite a mediocre scenario, I think a few characters were very well portrayed, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall, the production was mediocre. If the scenario was better, the film might have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an exceptional production.
