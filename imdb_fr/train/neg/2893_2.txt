What was it supposed to be? A remake of Fisher King? Why are we interested in Sandler? What a slow film, monotonous, boring, which gives a sacred film on these people !!! Simply just painful to sit, I turned it off before the end. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs as much help as Sandler; as I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in his daily life? We are not supposed to have this deep thought, I suppose. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to become violent with him? If they were such good friends, how did they separate? If Cheadle has such control, why is he still looking for the therapist's advice on the street? We are never told. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and why it was all bad. Nearly 8 out of 10 average score? I do not agree at all. Even the best movies have the chance to get such a high average score, and this shit does not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
