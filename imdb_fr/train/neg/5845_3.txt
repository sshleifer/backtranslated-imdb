Well, after watching this, I can say that it's not the worst movie of all time "yes, people are worse than that", there are good points for the film, "you have to look at Drunk teenagers, having horrible deaths "and cute rats looking for a scientific experiment, and becoming grotesquely gigantic, the drunken janitor, the grumpy doctor, and yes a girl in thong who has absolutely no shame, jocks idiots, I could not personally expect the rat who ate these drunk idiots, I was looking for the rat at the time, he had a good premise, the first part of the film, was interesting but with the scientific explantation on the rats, and the little story back, but I think it was ruined when drunken and drunk horny teens come into play, the rat in my opinion, the one who gets lost, his name is Brenda, was so fake, had to be a cGi rat "looked like a guy dressed in a suit of Beaver ", it was pretty schlocky, lame, but not totally awful,
