A surprising misfire from Larry Cohen (God also told me, Q, etc.), generally reliable, Full Moon High does everything possible to be funny and fails miserably, even with Ed McMahon's decent turns (!) And Kenneth March. Alan Arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and his son Adam is simply numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic.
