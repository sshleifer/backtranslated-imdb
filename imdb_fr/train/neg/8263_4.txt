'Mojo' is a 1950s London story, a world of budding rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a filming technique from the 1950s that is often seen in films, which emphasizes the physical differences of our time but also represents dialogue in a very exaggerated way (because of the way speech was represented in the films made at that time); I do not know if people have really talked like that outside of cinema, but no film shot today and shot in the contemporary period uses such stylized language. It is as if the scalded speech of the writers of the 1950s served as a common shorthand for a past that seems to be a very distant country; and therefore emphasizes the particular, rather than the universal, history. "Mojo" presents an excellent performance by Ian Hart and boring Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a career after that of "Trainspotting"; but feels like a period piece, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom. Rather annoying, actually.
