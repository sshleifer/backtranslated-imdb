This film reminds me a little less of a film by Mary-Kate and Ashley. I think that even though Alyson is more of an actress, in the film, Amanda Michalka was sometimes satisfied but Alyson felt stink. I think that after the musical in high school, they needed to find something better and it really was not that. The scenario was not great and I think they should have convinced two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not make me better. I think they should really be sick of singing and watching this movie only if you have nothing better to do (which I unfortunately did not do)
