I can not believe I'm sitting through all this. This film has the worst role since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief overview of the plot: The film begins with Jojo and this other girl sitting on the beach, drooling on a skinny beach with blond hair "handsome kid" who looks like not going to the gym one day of his life. One way or another, everyone knows him and every chick in the movie wants it. UH OH! Here is the competition! The stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. We soon discover that Jojo's mother got the job of her life in Australia, which means Jojo should move out and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'm going to cry). A huge storm arrives and fills their pool with stale water. One way or another, for no apparent reason, the little girl falls into the pool and finds herself face to face with, yes, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where "history" takes flight. Basically, they want the mermaid to fall in love with the "hunk". <br /> <br /> It's a pretentious movie with such a bad game that the 80s look like the pinnacle of Oscar-winning performance. This movie has all the possible clich√©s ... the best friends, the "hunk" that everyone wants, the "nasty" naughty girl and her bitchy friends, the scary old man ... you name him, he is the. I took one for many people watching this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes as a sacrifice for you. Please, do not see this movie. Do not make me suffer in vain.
