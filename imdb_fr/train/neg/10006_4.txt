I do not know who to blame, the shy screenwriters or the unintelligent director. It seemed like one of those movies where the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) were getting so much money that there was not enough left to make a movie. It could have been a lot of fun, but there was a veil of shyness, if not cowardice, that covered every scene. Since getting the R rating anyway, why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman, not Angie Harmon? Why is Sheen Sleepwalk going through potentially hot relationships with two of the sexiest and most beautiful actresses in the world? If they were just looking for laughter, why not choose Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta? It was so predictable that I was surprised to find that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not only for the viewers but also for the actors.
