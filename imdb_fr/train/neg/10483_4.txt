I saw this film on a westbound flight of American Airlines. It was so bad that the flight seemed longer. The plot had potential (who would not like a movie about a woman who accidentally kills all the Elvis impersonators she meets?), But he got screwed up millions of times because of a writing really mediocre. Towards the end, there is an embarrassing scene where a group of Elvis imitators is on the roof of a casino changing the sky thinking it will come back, then a group of stars gather to form an "Elvis" constellation, which quickly pulls a bolt. from lightning to imitators, sending them crashing through the roof. Bad ... really bad. What is the theme of the whole film? I would avoid this one at any cost.
