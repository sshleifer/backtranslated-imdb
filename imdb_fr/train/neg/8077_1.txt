I saw this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was free. I must be one of the twenty people who saw this film at the theater. I do not remember all that, but I remember that I was incredibly bored, that the plot was meaningless and that when I came out of the theater, the only thing I could say was that At least now I know what is the worst movie I have ever seen was. Only one thing bothered me incredibly: if they can bring the temperature down when the sun is low enough for humans to survive, why can not they bring it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being hot and sweaty? How much do they think we are?
