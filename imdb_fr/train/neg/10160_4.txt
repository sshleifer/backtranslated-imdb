A typical Lanza film that had limited public appeal, with a low story that was created simply to justify Lanza's contract with MGM at the time. his obscene advance towards her from the camera (and sometimes on). Moreover, his gutter mannerism and the constant smell of alcohol on his face during the scenes they had together were intolerable. After doing their second (and last) film together, "Toast of New Orleans", Grayson, normally silent, burst into Louie B. Mayer's office and told her in clear terms that she would never work with Lanza? period. Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lanza. Grayson's statement was therefore blocked. Grayson then starred in a number of popular (and much more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life, when asked to compare Lanza and Keel, she replied that there was no comparison and that Keel was a pleasure to work with and attracted more "real people" public.
