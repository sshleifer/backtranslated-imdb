Why bother to see this movie if you have some great movies to see? It is a total loss of time and money. The film is so bad that I felt bad to want to watch it. Everything is bad. The actors were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI of all time. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. One interesting thing that is, there is a character we wish he dies because he is so stupid that we have enough. /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to see a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 stars out of 10
