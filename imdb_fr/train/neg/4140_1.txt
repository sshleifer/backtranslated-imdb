As you may have heard or not, there is no real fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. One can then wonder why the title suggests such a thing, but in reality it is rather appropriate, because nothing else in this film made sense. There was absolutely no story or plot, just things that were happening. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than the Safeauto ads. <br /> <br /> Not only was there no fight between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies. Their makeup seemed to have been applied by an 8 year old girl. The scene was totally random and irrelevant and staged one of the zombie fighting characters with a hedge trimmer (I'm not kidding) but they used sound effects with a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> It was without a doubt the poorest movie I have ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not totally ridicule everyone responsible for the production of this film is if I learned that it was entirely produced by children of 11 years. <br /> <br /> Really good, even with all the criticism I have I suggest to watch this movie only because it's maybe the worst movie of all time and it's pretty comical. Even counting only the defects, this should entertain you.
