Remember the good old animated 90's batman show? The one that people have rented? The one that people of all ages could enjoy? The one who showed Batman as a real detective instead of Hulk in Bat Costume? Whoever had bad guys with whom you could identify? Whoever had bad guys with real motives? <br /> <br /> Of course, Warner Bros. do not do it. Whence this moron. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about Batman? Have they ever even watched a Batman comic? Do they know that Batman is supposed to be a "detective"? Assembling two clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a smart monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic presentation of an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. 'Opening credits'. Batman finds the dead gift where he is. Batman is going there and is in trouble. Commercial. Batman finds an obvious / foolish way out. Penguin escapes. Penguin is making something obvious again. Batman follows. They make kung-fu (by the way, everyone, and I mean everyone knows that kung fu is for some reason). The penguin of the Batman punch. he is stunned. Go to Arkham. (Note: it's usually a different villain for every episode) <br /> <br /> Well, you may have noticed, Batman is not an excellent detective. "Joker has left that piece of cotton candy on the floor, it may be at the old amusement park"! Yeah maybe, he was there the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I already mentioned that, but EVERYONE KNOWS THE KUNG-FU! EVEN PENGUIN! what were they thinking? (probably because it comes from the people who created this animated series Jackie Chan) <br /> <br /> What is really disturbing is that the show is only action. No sense. No. If Batman needs to think, he will use the technology and then make kung fu. <br /> <br /> But do not forget the bad guys. After all, what would Batman be without his gallery of thieves? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, I must say, congratulations for the originality. I do not think Batman's other media would have imagined a joker and a frightened monkey, an enigma like an emo and poison ivy as a minor (which is a bit confusing when you think about it, Is not her sexuality supposed to be her main strength?) <br /> <br /> But what's even more crappy is that each character is now a stereotypical 2-dimensional crook. <br /> <br /> EG <br /> <br /> The Croc killer wants to flood Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a power-hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for an unexplained reason. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal everything. Without reason. <br /> <br /> notice a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting must be Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy Batman Award: The Animated Series wins the episode 'Heart of Ice'? Who gave Mr. Freeze the reasons for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in comics on his original story (mad scientist)? Whoever made it a victim, with a purpose? Hell, even Batman & Robin have recognized that, using this as the origin of Mr. Freezes in this P.O.S. movie. <br /> <br /> Well this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr. Freeze a jeweler before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then freezes and gives him the power to cool things down. He then continues to steal jewelry for no reason, while saying lines like "A day of ice". <br /> <br /> Maybe they still watched Batman & Robin. <br /> <br /> But Hey, look at the bright side of things. This series does not make you feel bad, which means you are a good person. Good for you.
