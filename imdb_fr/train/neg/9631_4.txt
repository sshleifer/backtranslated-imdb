The film seduces the audience because of the charisma of Ben Stiller and the notoriety of J. Aniston. It seems we have here the recipe for a successful title, but there is nothing that succeeds in this film. <br /> <br /> Polly is very well interpreted by Aniston, without a doubt. This is the kind of character that suits him perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same problematic guy as in "Meet the parents", but in this movie, comic scenes are few in comparison to the title mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor with nothing special at all. With these two well-paid actors, things could go a lot better, but what can they do when the story and the storyline are poor? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
