I do not know at all which director George Schlatter was hoping to sell this comedy of evils. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough dapper clothes and polyester to cover the 1970s, "Norman" plays like an image of blaxploitation combined with a lot of stupid sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention a cameo Long Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of a separate married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) who learns the hard way that their son is secretly gay - and who lives with a prancing white homosexual - has enough jokes to wrist to shame one of the first episodes of "Three's Company". Bailey keeps his dignity and the confusion that reigns in Foxx is good for some laughter, but the rest of the performers are humiliated. * from ****
