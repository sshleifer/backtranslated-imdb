I have to congratulate myself for watching this movie all the way through, because it was really painful. An incapable painter becomes a fully capable hitman? This film was full of nonsense and if I mentioned them all, I would give them away. Norm Peterson, aka George Wendt, must be really in a rut for agreeing to make this film. The acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. As a sane and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from or where he was going with this film. There was incompetence on the part of each main character, there was a series of unfortunate and ridiculous events, and then the movie ended. An absurd act after another with dialogue does not make a film, it only causes a chatty shipwreck.
