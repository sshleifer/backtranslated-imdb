When converting a book to a movie, it is usually wise to keep at least some of the tone or concepts conveyed by the author, rather than completely ignoring it. While it is clear that the director had access to and followed the advice of Elinore Stewart's children, it is important to note that the children believed that their mother was a complete liar with respect to enriching and rewarding experiences. of family life. . The book details her life on her and her husband's properties in the vast Wyoming border; she recounts daily adventures with her many friends and acquaintances, even if they lived tens of kilometers away. However, the film takes a standard stance for the time it was filmed, describing this woman's experience as harsh, ruthless, and almost pointless. The director may have brought some of his experiences from the Vietnam War to this film (as some film-goers have said), but that seems like an ugly excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book and the turn into a dark, odious landscape without friends or hope. Do not waste your time with this movie; read the book instead.
