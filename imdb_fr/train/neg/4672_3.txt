This film has beautiful scenery and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too nervous as a girl and can not compete with the much more nuanced and mature rendering of Olivia De Havilland in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist conclusion also runs counter to the austere conclusion of the novel Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodies feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
