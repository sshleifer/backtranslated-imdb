I like the stories of Jane Austen. I only read two (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this adaptation, I'm waiting for "Persuasion" from my library to make sense of the story, and also, because I refuse to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense. For me, I thought that if you base a movie on Jane Austen's novel, you can not really go wrong. This will be fine by default. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, where are the characters with whom you sympathize and love? You must have at least one nice character to get the audience to invest their emotions, and that did not succeed. Of course, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to meet, but only because you know that the purpose of the story is to bring them together. Instead, I had to resist the urge to throw my cup of tea on the television and continue to watch until the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was really annoying and at the end I did not really understand why Wentworth was so impressed with her, as there seemed to be nothing there to attract her. She was gentle, faded, deaf, socially inadequate, and behaved like a sheep by following the instructions of all the others, instead of having her own mind. This can still work for a main character, if you do it right. It was not done well. <br /> <br /> The other characters showed only varying degrees of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst, with a narcissistic personality disorder in its own right. Where Mrs. Bennet in P & P had the same flaws, she was still endearing, while Mary was more of a monster show. More hateful than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very handsome and seemed to be a decent guy. For most of the story, I was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he was in love with Anne. Also, it is surely the kind of person who would like a person a little more ... alive? To act wise, not to say too much, because I reacted more to the characters represented rather than to see if the people who acted were good or bad. Anthony Head was excellent, but as soon as I saw he was in, I was not expecting less. <br /> <br /> I also found the story very confusing. It is only at the end of the film that it seems that Elizabeth is not Anne's stepmother, but a sister (I'm still not 100% on this). The whole story of Anne / Wentworth was also a little blurry. They were together but broke up and they are both bitter. How to come? I had been wondering about this for a while, and the explanation seemed to be that she had thrown it away because she was persuaded to do it by someone? But it was said "by the by" way that it was almost missed, as if it was somehow irrelevant. How can it be unimportant when it is the very heart of history? There were also a lot of names falling, but nobody really knew who the characters were. This person from Louisa for example, who was she? A friend? Family? What? It was not explained very clearly who are the different characters and their relationships with each other. Lady Russell was there, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister, which seemed very unrealistic when Mrs. Croft looked old enough to be her mother. <br /> <br /> The last kiss, yes, it was a little strange to kiss them in the street, but I did not really think about it, because I was too busy shouting "READ WITH THIS ALREADY! " on television, because Anne's lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what seemed like centuries before they actually met Wentworth's. You have a hesitation about it, but only a few seconds, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then there is the question of camera work. As a regular viewer, you do not pay attention to angles unless you decide to take care of them. I did not decide to do it here, but I noticed them anyway. For me, this means that filmmakers do not do a good job. Many conversations have taken place with extreme close-ups of the face, which should only be used when there is a really important point to make. In this adaptation, it was overexploited and therefore lacked meaning. The hand feeling held occasionally also did not work well in a period drama. The work of the camera in the race scene at the end also felt too contemporary. (Not to mention the race itself.) It was the only Austen adaptation I had during ITV's Austen season. I wonder if it's worth looking at "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" or if I should just read the books and leave them there. I'm sad to say, this is an adaptation of Jane Austen that I did not appreciate. Maybe I'll look at the 1995 version instead. The BBC is renowned for making nice Austen adaptations before, after all.
