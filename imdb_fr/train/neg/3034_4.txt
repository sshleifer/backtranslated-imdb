This movie has a galaxy of big adult stars but can not seem to interest you like an adult movie should be. Of all the stars, you can not get your kick from any of the scenes. The film is shot in a dream setting as a middle age that is embarrassing of cheese. The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talking about his child in college and the dialogue is the worst I've seen in a movie. The plot was also worse by ten. I'll stick to the amateur way. The audio comment was useless since it was a skin film, but even then it was bad. Unless you're a big fan of Jenna Jameson, there's not much here. 4/10
