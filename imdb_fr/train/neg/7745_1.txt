Where to start? special effects must be named special defects. When the director shouted "action", I guess he also asked the actors to perform the worst performance they could think of. Maybe he was bothered by the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not get back a cent of their investment and that their work would be a case study on how not to make a film. Or maybe he hated the art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not let him. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is sure is that whoever will use it in the future is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he had changed his name and deleted all previous references.
