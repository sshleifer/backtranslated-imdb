I watched the malayalam movie "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English film of the same name) for a long time. The basic story of garam masala is the same, but it is told in a pathetic way. Chic jokes are replaced by routine jokes found in normal Hindi movies (the director probably did so to suit the tastes of the Hindi public) ... <br /> <br /> I do not have not seen the English original. But had really enjoyed the movie in Malayalam (directed by Priyadarshan himself), which was at the time a heartbreaking comedy. Of course, the game of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the role of the cook) was so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> I'm probably too struck by the Malayalam movie so that I can not tolerate the smallest flaws of his Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have done too much. Paresh Rawal did a decent job - but does not achieve any goals near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But overall, all is well, compared to other recent Hindi comedy films.
