Of all the movies (and I'm a film graduate, if it's worth something to you), it's the worst film I've ever seen. I know there are probably worse things I have not seen yet, but I've seen that and it's the worst. A friend and I rented one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She is not credited! His role was incredibly small! How did she manage to make the cover !? IMDb does not even mention it in his filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case. It says something like "please, spare your other customers to have to watch this complete and totally bad movie!"
