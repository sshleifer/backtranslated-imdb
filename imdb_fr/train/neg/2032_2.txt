I gave these two stars for the impressive clarity of DV shooting, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of his character. It was generous, I know it. <br /> <br /> This film is a failure. I can not recommend it because it is neither poetic nor brutal. Neither dramatic nor suspenseful. Neither controversial nor ordinary. It's just a garbage that no horror or feather enthusiast can recommend in good faith. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, whoever you are. . .Please stay away from this horrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
