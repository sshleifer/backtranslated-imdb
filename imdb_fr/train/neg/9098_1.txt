There is a reason why some movies go directly to video and of course, the obvious reason is that if it's too bad for the theater audience, skip to the video. Of course, it would not be fair for movies that are good and yet they are also released directly on video. This one is no exception, although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne who deserves a better or at least a better agent and Sarah Thompson who deserves roles a departure from teen melodrames. The film is also wrong: this film takes place before the Cruel Intentions, so this film is a previous movie and rather stupid. It was a mess and it really is a movie that is at the same level as soft core porn movies and Ã  la carte masturbation movies. Fortunately for the actors, I hope they can erase this from their resume. So, if you're looking to see something nasty, but do not have the guts to buy porn, rent this movie as a starter.
