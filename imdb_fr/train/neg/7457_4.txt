Chris Kattan is an excellent actor on the Saturday Night Live skit ... but he should probably leave the film industry alone unless he can exercise creative control. He plays an annoying character who turns out to be slightly retarded and fast. Do you want to know the only fun parts? The things they showed in the surveys. Yes, his interpretation of taking on me is funny. Nothing else is. Especially when you can say that he is trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he should not have to try because he is one. And yet, his article "demolish the veterinarian's office" is terribly bad. This film made me develop an eye contraction. Avoid it at all costs and keep watching SNL.
