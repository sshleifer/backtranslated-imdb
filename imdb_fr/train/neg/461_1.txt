Warning: Avoid this horrible film ... If you look at it, you will be so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are their grandmother's age, what are they doing now? Try so hard to be innocent and sexy young, but do not work at all. Pam and Denise act so horribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> More The scenario is absolutely atrocious, I can not believe that anyone can have such rotten ideas. With the development of the film industry, moviegoers are not as easy to satisfy as those of the last century. I bet that moviegoers of the last century will hate that too. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I think that watching "White Chicks" from 2004 is so much better than that ... make no mistake, I thought it was the worst movie I have ever seen.
