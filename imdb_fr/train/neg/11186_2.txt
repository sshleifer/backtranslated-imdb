I wanted to watch this movie, but a weird and ridiculous scene after another forced me to turn it off. The characters do not seem to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger walks one night (in a graveyard, I believe) when he is attacked by spirits he hunts. Once past this ordeal, he walks away calmly and finds a friend who has seen everything. When asked what's going on, he kindly says "attacked by demons, nothing serious.", As if it was just a little more exciting than a flat tire. <br /> <br /> I close it when they go to ask something - a demon or something, I stopped worrying - a question. The answer can not be praised to anyone who has the energy of his death, and the priest watches what appears to be a vague boredom while a man is suspended and hanged and asks his heartbreaking question about his body. <br /> 0 stars on ****.
