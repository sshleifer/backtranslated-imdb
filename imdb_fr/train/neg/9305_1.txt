I and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. First actor .... wow ... the acting was the worst, the effects were really bad too, it looked like a movie made by a student. The plot was pretty good, but it was done. What has ruined the cinema the most is the actors. The main character was the worst actor of all time ... it's a shame that I call him the same actor ... The only good thing about this movie is that it was so bad he was funny ... so if you want to laugh at it .... but other than that ... stay away from this one. I usually like B-list movies and more, but this one ... I do not know how it was adopted to be video ... this one is the worst I've ever seen. and I have seen some badly.
