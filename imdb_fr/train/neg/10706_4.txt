Wow and I thought all of Steven Segal's movies were bad. Whenever I thought the film could not get worse, it proved the opposite. The story was good but the actors could not win. In addition, they made many mistakes about how to conduct appropriate archaeological digs. For example, you do not manipulate artifacts until they are cataloged and counted. The biggest crime of casting was the girl archiologist. She is a weak actress and I felt that her role made the film less realistic than it already was. The very idea that the Templars were underground all these years seemed to me rather stupid. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and all that, so it seemed almost depressing. I thought the characters were not explained enough. You did not find a lot of backgrounds and it made it more difficult to communicate with them.
