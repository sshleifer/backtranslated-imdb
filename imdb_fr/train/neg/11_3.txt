If you look at the Corey Large information here on IMDb, there is apparently a movie called "Reload" in production (as of June 2008) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how did such a crappy movie ever have a sequel ... and then, was Sebastian not killed at the end of "Loaded "? <br /> <br /> I watched this in the early morning hours battling insomnia, and so I drifted in while it was on. I'm sure I missed points in the plot, but overall, it seemed really low. The performance of Large was (for me) one of the strongest parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised to see everyone commenting on the pretty girls because I found the actress who plays Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.
