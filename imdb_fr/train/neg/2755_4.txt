It's the most painful collection of cliches, aligned in a straight line, with no discernible plot or decent action I've known for a long time. Canibalizing scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it was a merciless war against the intelligence of the viewer. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Even if it's not so serious to be funny and become cult like a comedy, the film offers laughter. The trick is to place the copied scenes in the context of their original movies. Gandalf can be funny to speak Korean, basil looking for a hilarious snake when compared to a kitten and the naughty henchman can provide a lot of fun by alternating Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever his name. <br /> <br /> Final result: any pleasure derived from this film is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and the imagination of the spectators, and not the director / scriptwriter. Shame on you, Shim!
