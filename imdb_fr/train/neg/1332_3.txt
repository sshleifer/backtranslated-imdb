The novelty of hearing four-letter words, Jay Leno, is the only memorable aspect of this amazing combination of police and police partners. In COLLISION COURSE, the pelican-faced comedian teamed up with the late Pat Morita to find a stolen turbocharger prototype (did the car enthusiast Leno play a role in the plot?). The two main actors are making great efforts, they really do, but Leno is not an actor and Morita's out-of-water fish routine is aging rapidly. The film is a little seductive as in the 80s, but its deserving moments are becoming increasingly rare as it fills its long duration of 100 minutes. The fans of Leno's considerable comic talents will feel disappointed; everyone will just be bored.
