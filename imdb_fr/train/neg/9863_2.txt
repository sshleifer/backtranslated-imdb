Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his supreme grip on the subgenre Mockumentary is not bothered by the upgrade at least, especially by this extremely funny shot from the RPG players. The jokes are beyond lame. Not enough substance to last the typical duration of a SNL skit (particularly rancid), let alone the horrid 87 minutes I spent watching this driv. The great William Katt (the greatest American hero, House) deserves a lot MUCH better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw it worthwhile in my mind and that's what I just said here, so I hope I hope I'll save someone from such a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: 2 audio comments; 7 interviews with various members of the cast; 4 deleted scenes; and theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> Extras for a DVD-ROM: 2 wallpapers <br /> <br /> Easter egg: put your eye on the main menu picture for a short scene
