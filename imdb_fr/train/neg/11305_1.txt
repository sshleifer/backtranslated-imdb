It is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like the film was shot in California instead of Jack Slade, Idaho, Colorado and Montana. He will fiction all that we know about this mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is horrible; there is very little direction, and lousy to act. Dorothy Malone is completely lost as a woman. Mark Steven never seems to know how to describe this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good theater superintendent. The inhabitants of his city feared him for his excessive consumption of alcohol. Drunk, he was fighting and causing other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To ensure he could never terrorize them again, the militia lynched Jack Slade after ignoring their warning to leave the city immediately. It's a horrible film. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how Hollywood stumbles the story as it pleases, even to this day.
