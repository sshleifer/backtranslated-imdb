This mini-series, also based on a book by Alex Haley as "Queen", tried to use similar formulas, that is, to build a long story that follows the life of a family for many years. While in "Queen" the result was masterful, here at Mama Flora, inspiration was lacking. First perhaps in the book itself, and most certainly in this television production. Over the years, we have set too much with too much haste, so that the saga that unfolds is superficial, superficial, not as authentic as in "Queen". The final score for the scripting in the early parts of the film was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed, the film seemed to degenerate into a kind of unpleasant Dallasian-Forsythian mix in the last third of its three hours or so. I had hoped for more; but obviously Haley was less inspired by this story than by his almost biographical "queen", and Peter Werner III can not compete with John Erman. Only recommended for those who have an appetite for these long stories of generations.
