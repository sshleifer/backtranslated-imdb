I've always been a big fan of Woody Allen and I'll always be for most of what he did in the past, but only a blind lover can ignore how dull, meaningless, pretentious this film is and especially horribly played. An empty mental masturbation based on incoherent motives. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate an alleged "Allen actor clone" is to put into the mouth and gestures of Will Farrell what Allen would have done in place of Farrell if he had been 30 years younger. The result was obviously ridiculous. And not to speak of dialogues ... what must have been philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual thought, ignoring its comic effect. How sad...
