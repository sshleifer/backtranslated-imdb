Follow the annotations of this and The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The original Matrix really pleased me. It was not a deep film, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was rather rhythmic, fun and I have a weakness for fighting in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> In the original, Neo was the secret life. of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson. From daytime, corporate drone, and night, brave computer hacker. Finally, he is finally forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine, or does he return to the safe and forgettable world in which he began? Interestingly, he discovers that once devoid of illusions, life fears rather. He has his daughter at his side and his precious companions, but he eats processed suisses, dresses in sweat and lives in a really basic machinery. Nevertheless, the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of this first film lies in the questions "What if it's me" asked the viewer. And if _I_ were capable of the impossible? And if I was "The One". The example of One, with a title as great as this, does not matter. <br /> <br /> In addition, Agent Smith created a wicked villain because he embodied all the fear of authority. we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator and ruthless. <br /> <br /> At the end of the matrix, Neo must return to the matrix to share his good news about freedom. <br /> <br /> The film fails to fully realize the ideas of the original film, and it does so with such a lack of taste, writing and editing so mediocre that I can not believe they have planned these changes. When the dialogue is at the fifth level and various long words are added randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My short list of characterization failures: <br /> <br /> The Oracle goes from little useful, if misleading, to completely obstructionist without any real reason. <br /> <br /> The major "personalities" of the matrix are unnecessarily introduced - the key master, for example, was a cute idea, but not an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses its role as "advisor" and gets nothing to replace it. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants of Sion are not particularly friendly, and you would not really want them to run the world. <br /> <br /> Special effects problems: <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are vain and intermittent. In Matrix, you thought that Neo could lose and that he had to become bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is simply the character from a point of view of a particularly poorly planned video game. <br /> <br /> The fight on the highway looked pretty fake and not very interesting. <br /> <br /> problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fight scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> The rave lasted too long - everyone in the row at the theater was watching his watch. Not because we care about good dancing and good orgies, but because we do not know the people represented, we do not care. <br /> <br /> Whatever the hack written, the creator's monologue should be excluded from the list. He despised, used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand, and was a waste of time and a killer of stimulation. The creator's speech could have been delivered in one-tenth of the time, and with more peril, "Zion exists to give the rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix." There are now too many people who do not do not believe, the womb can not stand even the inhabitants of Zion, let alone those others.You can choose a person from Zion to form the new Zion, while I clean up the memories of the people presently in the matrix. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we had a long band of sornements. If someone says it's deep, ask for a transcript and try to break down the sentences. Each is too long of several clauses and uses words with clearer and shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, it is not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I saw the third, and despite what many critics have said, skip it. It does not save this turkey. <br /> <br /> Critics who believe that the second and third films were "deep" should go to see really deep films. Maybe read a book or two about rhetoric and debate, and maybe a little philosophy. This film is not difficult to understand, but difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> Scott
