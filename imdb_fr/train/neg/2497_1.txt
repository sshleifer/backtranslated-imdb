There is only one problem with this site, you can not give a negative rating. In addition, a companion described it as a D-quality film. I say he was too kind. A piece of wood could be more emotional than the actors in this film, and the money used to produce this film would have been better used to light a fire. It's absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who supports this bloodless bath will never come back. After watching the movie for 5 minutes, the boys and I wondered if pouring bulk lorries would make the conversation more entertaining. Half a carto and a bottle of 151 later, I finally found some of this note of G acting amusingly. It's an insult to the whole planet. The director thought that everyone could find something better in this situation. He should go buy a rope. And for the actors of this film, I hope you were well paid to participate in this joke, because I doubt that you were working again. In summary, everyone in this movie receives a fine of 100,000 points and 12 demerit points from your acting license.
