Extremely disappointing movie based on James Michener's novel. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando's performance was even worse. His southern voice was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke as he looked like an old lady from the south who was coming home to sleep. Brando, so good in previous films, has been reduced here to a laughing stock. Tyrone Power, in "Prosecution Witness", should have been nominated for Best Actor instead of Brando. <br /> <br /> The film, which deals with racism, deals with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was in stone throughout the movie. He goes from anti-relationship relationships to a professional relationship when he discovers love with an Asian woman. His emotions and discussions made it difficult to see how he could adopt such opinions. <br /> <br /> Only the Lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki were supported by the Oscars for their performances. None of the performances were so impressive. Umeki's presence on the screen was short and devoid of as much as possible. Miiko Taka, who played well for Brando's sake, made a better performance in this film. She showed great emotion as an anti-American who found love with the character of Brando. His face was engraved with the misfortune of losing his father and brother during the eleventh world war. She realized that her dance was not her way out of that life she was living. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott passed from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in "The Ten Commandments" to the fanatical mother of Brando's love at first. His performance with that of Ricardo Montalban was lost. Patricia Owens, Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
