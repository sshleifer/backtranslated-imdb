I do not distribute them often, but if there's a movie that deserves that kind of attention, it's "Gas!" It's self-indulgent shit that tends towards the mood of M * A * S * H ​​and falls completely flat in its attempt. <br /> <br /> I see what Corman wanted to do - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce the role without death of Gould in the original version of the film M * A * S * H ​​with a similar scenario (in the movie "Whiffs" - look here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the brass ring with "Whiffs", unlike Corman with "Gas!" but not quite succeed. None of these films even came close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Gas!"? What is not? No one really approaches acting at a higher level than college theatrics. Production values ​​stinks. Someone else here mentioned the lighthouses magically regenerating on a van, and this lack of attention to detail. Nothing works as expected in this movie and no one cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually put me to sleep. This is not a safe cure for insomnia, but really close. On the kinematic sleep induction scale, "Gas!" somewhere between "Last Year at Marienbad" and the remake of "Solaris" by George Clooney (which was remarkable in itself for being more boring than the original of Mosfilm, although this studio seems to ignore the idea of ​​retaining the public attention by judicious editing). <br /> A wise edition would have decimated "Gas!" at about twenty minutes. The result would be useless, but no more than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they have an irrefutable quality that makes them interesting to watch. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even fun.
