I had a lot of expectations for this movie and more because it was a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy operates a call center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach his boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two fall in love and decide to flee, but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can not do it because she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and it is only then that Jimmy discovers that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a gift. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to find Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> With Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the film is directed by director for the first time, Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" must be one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Yes! The landscape is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her high-profile weight loss) looks good. But the plot is extremely thin and sometimes has no sense from one scene to another - that's why I said at the beginning that I was expecting more from this movie because it was about Yashraj production. As for the songs, unfortunately, there is not a song I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are times when we can laugh and it is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could definitely have done better while Kareena Kapoor played her role well. But that can not be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain. Finally, no matter Aditya Chopra, who has already produced and directed good films such as "Mohabbatein", what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: bad movie, do not waste your time and this is my first and last impression.
