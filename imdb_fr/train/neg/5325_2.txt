Polish criticism must be a feminist because she finds that "Young Catherine" is a fantastic and historically accurate film. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a Russian historian practicing for many, many years, I was an exception to the rule with YC, and in particular with his politically correct portrayal as the boss who alone brought Russia in a dominant direction. The truth? She was brought to St. Petersburg only to be a wife and mother and discovered that she needed to "bond" with the Dvorian, the Boyars and the Armed Forces to survive. As long as she did not dispute them, she could / could fulfill her cultural wishes (fill the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not "great", but in this area of ​​post-modern revisionism, the evidence is not very popular. YC is only a costume drama, a bit of Ted Turner down, which, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of the bad image of Russia in the West.
