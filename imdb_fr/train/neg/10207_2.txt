Alfred Hitchcock invented any type of thriller he could think of: he set the standards so high that any director who produces a thriller will be fatally compared to him. <br /> <br /> The main subject of this vehicle Bullock, all the ideas, almost everything was already in the classic "rope" of Hitchcock: the two students who commit a free crime, the Nietsche philosophy and the clues that the boys broadcast, the Master was the first to transfer them to the screen. movie-minute that was a fascinating technical tour de force. <br /> <br /> "Murder by numbers" does not take place in one piece, like "the rope", notice it. And what a supreme originality it opposes two policemen to mischievous youngsters and, you'll never guess, these two policemen are very different: in fact, Bullock plays the role of a woman who lives as a man and his partner (Chaplin) is as shy as a helpless girl. The performances of the two boys are not really staggering, not as good as, say, that of Edward Norton in "primal fear". <br /> <br /> Well, you know, "the rope" was so good ....
