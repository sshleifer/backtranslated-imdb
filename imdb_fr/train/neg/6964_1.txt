I usually watch the MTV film awards for watching a fun and witty program that features a unique awards program (Chewbacca winning an award for lifetime achievements as an example). So this year was no different. Although I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny, stupid, stupid to me. I laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies and I even liked it in Dude Where's My Car ?. But the prices of the MTV movie were just horrible. Nothing was consistent, fun or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should continue to sing and dance; he certainly can not act. <br /> <br /> I am curious to know who were the writers of this show. The performances of Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar last year were extremely funny (the only parody of The Lord of the Rings was worth watching the entire show), but this year was completely different. Has anyone understood Timberlake's comments about Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They look together in a movie, but have never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke have just entered their lame dialogue, never referring to Timberlake's "joke". And Seann was completely lost as a talent, she did not even make me smile, and yet she was laughing alone. And what was the interest of Harrison Ford's one-liners? Did they make sense to anyone? MTV writers may have thought that younger viewers will only know the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or the president of Air Force One. I am confused. And would someone tell me about the affair with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old does he think he is? The guy looks to be 30 years old and trying to act again 19 .... give it up, show a little class (as in your best speech of the best actors academy) and act to your age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 out of 4 stars, simply because of Gollam's speech about the best visual performance. It was very creative, extremely well done and caused the only sincere laughter of the whole evening.
