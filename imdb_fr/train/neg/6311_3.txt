It's a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, for people, a real realistic movie is a good thing. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, insane, sometimes. Maybe that's why people say this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Too many common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are doomed and cursed, no matter what you do end up shooting or getting shot by someone; do not let children play with weapons, it could be dangerous; and then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before this one, I had not seen such a bad movie. This may be why I have never noticed how important photography is in a movie. In this one, every scene taken in broad daylight, in broad daylight, is clearly blue and boring. They did not even bother to correct the color balance. Oh! So far, I have "rated" more than 300 movies in this database, and this one (3/10) is the lowest ever recorded.
