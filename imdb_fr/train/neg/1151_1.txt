This film was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is her main character, is anything but "maternal". OK, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband dies. She then goes to her son and meets this piece that sleeps with his daughter and ends up sleeping with him. Until this part, the film is fine. Not great, but we can watch it. The guy is charming and who can blame her? OK, it's not very maternal to sleep with your daughter's lover, but blame it for the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> She becomes totally obsessed with the guy. I think that's the part where I started to dislike the movie. She still wants to please her "old-fashioned" with snacks while working at her son's house (I guess that's the only thing she's ever learned to do), as if that's the only way for her to get his attention. The guy is obviously not very interested (in fact, it looks like he plans to sleep with her as a charitable activity) and instead of being insulted by this, she continues to beg him to go to bed with her and be kind to her when he gets very violent. "I want to please you," she told him desperately as he insulted her very badly. <br /> <br /> What shocked me in this film is the total lack of self-esteem that the mother has for herself. She tells Craig something like, "I'm just a shapeless mass" the first time they sleep together. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the feminine genre. If it were me, I would have bought a small object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and much less emotional suffering ... :)
