Dear me ... Peter Sellers was one of the most strangely talented actors. But his choice of films, for example after 1964, was very unfortunate. He did not seem to understand how to use his talents. It would have been better to work with more Kubricks from the movie world than people he knew. Among his latest films, only "The Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" impressed me among those I saw. <br /> <br /> That said, the Boultings and Sellers had already made some movies before. it does not sound so bad - I have not seen "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - at least in the sense of good use of Sellers. But "There is a girl in my soup" is really a bad movie and a terrible choice on the part of Sellers in terms of character. In his films from 1955 to 1964, one can usually expect at least a very inventive turn and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. Here Peter Sellers is trying to play a typical romantic role. These are almost vendors who play a Niven cad without joviality. He certainly does not convince, does not try as he could, or does not create an interesting character. He should have left such roles to masters of suavity such as Cary Grant and focus on those intriguing dramatic and comical roles for which he was famous. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers do not really make real chemistry; This is not an easy and brilliant story developed by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It's a very unnatural appearance, all the way through - I know that Danvers is a tough ladies' prosecutor, but it does not really change convincingly. Sellers also has a very cute way of playing "charm" ... this character really has no depth and does not really arouse the sympathy or interest of the viewer. The salesmen follow the movements in a way that one would not think possible by remembering the magnificence of his sneaky and iconoclastic performance in "Lolita". <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say about the plot, the direction or the characters, because frankly they leave little or no impression. It's really one of the most anemic, complacent, misguided and slightly dull films I've ever seen. An absence of "vehicle" for the undisputed talents of sellers. <br /> <br /> Note: - * 1/2 / *****
