This show is one of the worst of all time! absolutely no original jokes and they are still a year late. as in 2009, they will finally say something about Michael Vick's fights. all members of the cast are people who wanted to be on SNL but had to go to the bottom of crazy TV. It's an hour of crazy magazine jokes that are not funny to start with, as told by the terrible John Stewart. So if you have a problem, tell me that I love to hear the opinion of the 3 people watching this show. a member of the family said, "Osama bin Laden was hiding in a place where no one would watch Mad TV's show, there's a reason nobody's watching the show.
