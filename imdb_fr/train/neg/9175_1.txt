This is the worst movie I have ever seen. This film corresponds to the quality of films such as "THEY" & "Cabin Fever", but even these had actors of name where this one was insufficient. The "candy in the eye" of this film seemed to be one in 50 women with a bad facelift. (just an example of quality). I would have rated this film in the negative if possible. Ladies, I must tell you that men were not bad to look at, but not a lot either. If you were going to see this movie, I would strongly recommend you to save your money.
