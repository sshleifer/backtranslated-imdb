The film is badly shot, with the exception of some old, familiar Hollywood names. Other representations under unknown names (Jennifer Gabrielle, for example) are irrelevant. I have seen other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Maybe it's a reflection of the scenario? <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the performance of Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita saved the film from oblivion. However, I loved Pat more in Karate Kid. There are many good films to watch, and in short, this one is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
