Incredibly stupid, redundant and humiliating closing of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that director Rachel Talalay deliberately wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into a big, tasteless joke. This is not just the worst entry of the "Elm Street" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies of all time and it's a real shock to fans of the genre! The story is stupid, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all trouble and ?? mostly ?? visual and special effects look like those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Were we supposed to be petrified when a talkative Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game character and stuck him to the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged girl. You would think he would mention it in one of his previous adventures, but no? There is only one surviving teenager in Springwood and Krueger uses it to get in touch with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this last installment is so awful is its completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is portrayed as the main character, but suddenly he dies and the plot continues to revolve around two adults! How about that: Freddy Krueger, who has spent five full-length movies killing only teenagers, ends up being beaten by two adults wearing 3D glasses! A little like ruin all the essence, is not it? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overestimated series, but so far, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. "Freddy's Dead", however, is simply unbearable and no one should waste precious time watching it.
