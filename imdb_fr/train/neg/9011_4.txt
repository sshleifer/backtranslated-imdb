Pretty things B-movie standard. Seriously, anyone watching "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a group of people making their first film must know that one should not expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to rework the formulas that are popular. If you even give them a symbolic analysis, you'll end up ruining the film for yourself (and perhaps writing a self-defeating and defamatory critique on IMDb). <br /> <br /> I loved the female star, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I found her particularly attractive. It was a memorable appearance of B-movie. Unfortunately, I do not see where she has made movies since. I will monitor her again.
