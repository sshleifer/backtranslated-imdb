So 'Thinner' ... Yep .. This story of Steven Bachman (read Steven King) about a man who pulls his right desserts from an old Gypsy he just killed I do not know why I do not I did not appreciate more than I could have. I guess what really distracts me is the actors. I mean, who is lead? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And someone crying, can you stop calling Joseph Mantegna for all the Italian mafia roles that are? And while we're there, does every mafia have to have an Italian mother who makes pasta? The only good acting job done here is less than 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as a former gypsy. He is pretty good. But the rest, I make you all, "best actors ..."
