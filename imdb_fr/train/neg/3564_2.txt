Pet Sematary, although a good 1980s horror film, with a friendly director and atmosphere, is a copy of Pupi Avati's Italian film ZEDER. It is clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas of this director (the film Zeder was shot before King wrote the book) <br /> <br /> The cat, the floor, everything was copied, it's a case of plagiarism, but as a famous American writer, Stephen Kind, it's quite normal that he can get away with it, it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of Italian films without budget (and in part, it's shit itself ...) but the original idea, I repeat, is the Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
