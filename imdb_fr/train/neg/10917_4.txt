I'm a fan of Columbo, especially a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was missing a lot. The original plot and twists were obvious and could be guessed in advance, even years before today's modern crime drama. But it was amusing to see the crazy couch models and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, the obligatory humor of the commuters make fun of modern art for sale. The high-tech house is a version of Tomorrowland in the Jetson or Disney, and it's fun to think of the writers who invent these "exit gadgets". <br /> <br /> If the sun shines from the outside, go play, there are much better episodes of Columbo. Nevertheless, we should be grateful for the cable TV that these episodes are broadcast.
