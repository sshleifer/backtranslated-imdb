If this film was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a great movie cult classic, this might have been a success. Have you ever watched a film so horrible that it becomes fascinating with its flaws? Well, that's it. All actors should be nominated for the worst interpretation awards. It would be difficult to find another film, with this kind of production budget, which contains so little value. All since opening scenes defies logic. The dialogue is completely incredible and illogical. Ditto for the behavior and the overall scenario of the film itself. What's really mind-boggling is that jesters in a boardroom actually decided to spend money on this trash. Sensational.
