First, this movie was not so bad.It was fun ... at least for me probably for all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original, so I can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of this strange film by Christopher Reeve, Village of the Damned. Both films have different intrigues, but this disgusting feeling and this unwanted comedy exist in both. <br /> <br /> The wicker man is supposed to be a mystery / thriller / men please, do not anger the movie about women. I do not know if all this was pagan and the sacrifice was a little less good. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self goes to an isolated island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long-lost fiancee who claims that his daughter was taken and hidden by other islanders . <br /> <br /> Cage is a policeman. As an exhausted policeman, he goes to the semi-unexplored island, leaving no information about his fate to anyone in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get complicated when the big Amish Scottish women who populate the island scold her and lie about the fate of the missing girl. Her fiancee is of no help, she seems to be elusive and exhausted all the time. Cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and that he is the lucky man who was trapped to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the festival of disease harvesting in the he is. <br /> <br /> In this film, men do not do so well. A twisted demonstration of feminism? <br /> <br /> I found the film laughable, especially when a cage hits women and walks in bear costume. I think there were too many potholes in this movie. I find that the concept of angry women isolated on an island without taking care of men is quite amusing, but the way it was described in this movie was just strange. Although most women have hurt and become angry, this is clearly sexism. I would have turned off the movie with disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice. This is not a thriller, it must be classed simply as strange.
