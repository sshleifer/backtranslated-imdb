A Cinderella story made for adults who live in the land of dreams. The romance is very unrealistic, flouteur, lovey dovey, perfect, etc. The plot of Cinderella to the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dream romance with a different twist, it's definitely your movie, but for the rest of us, real-world people, I highly recommend you win three hours. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who saw the movie with me would not recommend it. We had a good time destroying the majority of unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something ... I can not believe that a film like this can beat a classic like HDDCS !!
