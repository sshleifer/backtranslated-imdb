Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyres' first novel had. Apart from history, laughter, dark humor, political intrigue, characterizations, plot and a semblance of meaning. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from start to finish. They laughed at the plot, they had a love affair between Parablane and a policeman. What are you talking about, Dr. Slaughter was described as a passer-by and who the devil was supposed to be Annette Crosby? /> Looks like they made an adaptation of three hours, then reduced it to 90 minutes. (Even though the 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please, please do not do this to any other Brookmyres book, (especially "Country of the Blind.")
