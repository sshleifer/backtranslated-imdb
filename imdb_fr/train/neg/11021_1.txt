Hallam Foe tells the story of a boy who lost his mother and lives a sort of complex of Oedépus afterwards. <br /> <br /> It lasts about 95 minutes, but would be better in ten. There is almost an hour in the center where he practices climbing on the roofs and his habits in a church steeple like Quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> There is a strange love story that follows from it. nothing to do with anything. She looks like her mother, so what? We know that he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were. They should have just put the beginning and end together and it would have been a short film O.K. Now, it's the portrait of a character who does not change. He's a guy with whom it's happening. The only active choice he has in the middle of the film is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> There is this whole story of Oedépus that is supposed to lead us to analyze his character. He paints his face, wears women's clothes and wears a dead badger on his head. A badger! You must see the end! He goes home with the badger on his head (and he is shot like a dreadful horror movie) to kill his father's new wife (with whom he had sex at first). And one way or another, they thought it would not be entertaining enough, so they put indie punk music in the background. I must admit, however, that I am a little allergic to movies that want to write a psychological complex on the nose. Looks like this director / guy / whatever MacKenzie is trying to show us that he also studied psychology at school. You are so clever! Thank you for reporting all these forgotten theories in our memories! You really dug! What a blunder! Okay so now I realize that this film is based on a randomly chosen book, but anyway .. <br /> <br /> Photowise is boring. Many talking heads. In addition, the editor has changed the colors from one scene to another, you know cold and hot, etc. Why? "Hallam Foe" is perhaps both a feature film and a test film for color-blind people. Or maybe they thought the drama would not be enough to tell us he was lonely, so they raised the blue so we could get it. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they made in the presentation. And all the "cute" sex stuff going on. All this film is an independent shot. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Although it's really boring to be a film student and see how such bullshit goes through the machine.
