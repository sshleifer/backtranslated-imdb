I read all the reviews here AFTER watching this piece of film and it took me at least 2 pages to discover that someone else did not think that this appallingly disappointing montage was NOT the pinnacle of humor in the 70's other era! If it's not the least funny comic sketch I've ever seen, it'll be fine until it happens. Half of the sketches had already been made (and infinitely better) by artists such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I had to say that a beautiful piece of animation lasting about 90 seconds is the highlight from this film, do not be close to summarizing how this 75-minute waste is devoid of meaning and strength. Seminal comedy? Only in the world where the seminal DOES really mean that sperm. Scatologic humor? Only in a world where the feces are really scattered. Precursory jokes? Only if we mean by this is a manual explaining how NOT to do comedy. Breasts and tramps and the odd beaver. Well ... if you're a pubescent boy with at least one free hand and you have not discovered the existence of Playboy. Give a break because it was in the early 70's? No way. There had been comedy sketches dating back at least ten years ago. The only way I can even forgive that this movie was done is if it was a threat. Retro? Barely. Sketches of clowns that subtly pervert children may be at the cutting edge of technology in some circles (and that might have been funny), but it's really sad. What motivated me during the 75 minutes? The pure belief that they may have saved a really fun skit for the end. I gave a 1 to the film because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients ... or maybe to lockjaw sufferers .. their jaws would finally be open in disbelief.
