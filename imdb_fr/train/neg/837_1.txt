I really saw and loved the first two a lot. Especially because the second is not simply an attempt to make another as good as the first. And it's a story alone. You do not have to know the first movie. I also liked that in the movies "Free Willy". <br /> <br /> But ... the third, here, is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The film is good, it contains fun parts. But why? Timon and Pumba were fun creatures in the first two movies. What the Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a difficult attempt to have fun even more of the first film than he already had, in addition to telling the story from his point of view. But why? I would really like to know. You know, the idea that they're both sitting in the movies watching the first movie is really nice. But what comes next is mostly useless. I guess a lot of people liked Timon and Pumba, and so did I. Yet for me, many games have been built with an attempt to be funny. No luck, most were not funny at all, at least for me. Btw. What was the film about anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more pleasure from the first movie? I tend to choose option b and am very disappointed about it. <br /> <br /> If you like to see stories like "the story behind xy", you should see Tom Stoppard's "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really funny and do not try to make the most of "Hamlet".
