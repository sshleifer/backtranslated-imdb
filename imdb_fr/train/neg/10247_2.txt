It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it's horrible. Christopher Lee is good but there is hardly, the only positive point is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not rely on the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped watching it almost at the end, it was so bad, only for hard-core b-movie fans who have brains to support this vomit.
