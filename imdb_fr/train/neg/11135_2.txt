What more can i say? The acting was, almost without exception, amateurish. The staging and continuity were pitiful. The scenario was predictable until the very last scene and the dialogue tedious. One of the features of the DVD was entitled "Gag Reel", but it could have been a description of the viewer's reaction to most movies. <br /> <br /> One of the most fun things was in the director's comments on the DVD. He said, with a serious air, that he had decided to make a film with high production values ​​and a cast of names - and that he had succeeded. With such illusions, it is easy to understand how the film unfolded. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect is the monster. The darkwolf costume was a modified monkey costume (according to the "making of" function of the DVD) and looked at it instead. The mask and the claws were hardly better than in the costume shops. The CGI effects were painfully obvious and of similar quality to a cheap video game.
