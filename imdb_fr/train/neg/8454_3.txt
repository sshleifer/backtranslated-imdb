This series has its occasional ups and downs, and the last is the case here. There is a plethora of projections, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the editing is a seriously disjointed film, the filming gets rougher than usual. Sometimes, the action slows even more as the camera follows the wanderings without words of the "little", which is lost almost early. Overall, disappointment. <br /> <br /> That said, the music and the action that emanates from the oriental spaghetti deserve perhaps the approval of the televiewers. This slice spends a lot of time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to look into the abyss of death that his father opened to him.
