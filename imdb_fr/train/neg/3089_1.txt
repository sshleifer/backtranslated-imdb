This film is so bad, it's funny. In fact, Mystery Science Theater 3000, the TV show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this movie to make fun of him. I suggest watching it (maybe on YouTube) instead of seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, do not see Hobgoblins if you are not ready to stop in the first scene. In fact, do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. His jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you'll have a lot more fun parodying or watching a parody of it than watching the movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick while watching, so save yourself. Read a book. To do the laundry. Everything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
