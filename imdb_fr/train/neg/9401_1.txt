In this very low-budget movie (I've seen home movies with better production value), the Australian group has totally stolen the "Burning" and the "Friday the 13th", a group plans to make a video clip while being on a houseboat. They are hunted down by a serial killer who was burned years ago. This film is even proclaimed "the worst Australian film ever made" in its promotional material on DVD. It's only a point of sale! Complete and clean the garbage in all the considerable ways. Maybe a few laughs here and there for bad moviegoers, but it always made me want to burn my retinas. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a flash of just tiny nipples barely existing in a lame shower scene <br /> <br /> My Note: F
