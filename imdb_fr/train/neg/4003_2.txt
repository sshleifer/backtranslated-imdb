A major disappointment. It was one of the best British police and police series of the 90s that developed the fascinating title interpreted by the Scottish Robbie Coltrane. However, this unique piece has little to add and perhaps suffers an inevitable failure due to greater expectations when a special show returns after a long break. Coltrane does not really have much to do, he pays much more attention to the uninteresting killer and, in what he has to do, he does not seem to be involved, he is almost bored. The story of the ex-soldier is written in the books and the attempt to make us aware of Coltrane's family life seems light. Maybe if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of this two-hour show, they would have written it with much more depth. Like that, skip it and look at the old Cracker of the 90s, which is far superior.
