I never understood the attraction of this show. The acting is mediocre (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the intrigues of most episodes are mundane and uninteresting, the dialogue is weak, the jokes are not funny and it is painful to try to sit even a half episode. In addition, the link between this show and the 70s is extremely tenuous beyond the dress style, the landscape and the background used for the show. It only seems to be a modern sitcom with the same old clich√© script as that of the modern sitcom. have dressed up as representing a show from twenty years ago hoping to win nostalgic viewers or something like that. "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique in a much more effective way and are actually a pleasure to watch unlike this horrible and pathetic excuse for a show.
