This film was so amateurish that I could hardly believe what I saw. It's shot in VIDEO! NOT the movie! I have not seen this kind of thing since the early '70s, when late-night networks had screened the movie of the week "horror movies" in ...... video. It looks like a bad soap opera and compliments it. Some actors give the best of themselves. Michael Des Barres accepts what he is asked to do, namely to behave as an uncontrollable addict. I can not say that it's nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski as a therapist sits on a chair for most of the film, with very little variation in viewing angles. I can not blame him for blocking anyone else, but his role is totally incredible. Her little girl's voice is working against her here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassja Kinski. She is certainly ageless and exotic, but she is out of reach with that. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwhelmed. Each line she delivers has three exclamation points. Someone had to order him to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a fierce shrew? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette, as a sweet, bad-tempered woman, is doing well, and probably the most credible of the gang. But that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It must be the worst film I've seen in years.
