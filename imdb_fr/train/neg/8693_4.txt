I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and have lived in Arlington for a few years. This film was far from giving the impression that it looked like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of a scene! Texas does not have mountains. I suppose that happens when a film supposed to be in Texas is filmed in Canada. The accents are also really bad. They should have had Texas actors to play the roles. There are many aspiring actors from Texas to Hollywood. The film is really sad, because it's a true story. I pray that the killer be found and sentenced. The only good thing is that since her death, we now have the Amber Alert to quickly find missing children after their abduction.
