"Valentine" is another horror movie to add to the list of thorny movies (think "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer"). It's certainly not as good as the movies I mentioned, but it's better than most of the scams that appeared after the first movie "Friday the 13th". One of these films was "My Bloody Valentine", produced in Canada in 1981, which I hated a lot. "Valentine" is a better movie than this one, but it does not say much. The plot: a young nerdy boy is teased and fed by two of his comrades at the beginning of the film. Then, the film moves years later, once all of its comrades have grown up, and then they are chosen one by one. The killer is presumed to be the boy now grown up in search of revenge. But is it him? Or could he be someone else? "Valentine" has an appealing cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a dull script does not do them justice. There are, however, scary moments. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
