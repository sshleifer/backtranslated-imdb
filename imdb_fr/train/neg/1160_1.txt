It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is (I think) the story of a rebel university basketball player, his tough but fair coach, his girlfriend and another student (played by Michael Margotta) who suffers from a continuous nervous breakdown . The story is not going anywhere, there is no character development, there is no one to worry about, and the performances, except for Bruce Dern as a coach, are terrible. It's hard to believe that a talent like Jack Nicholson can make such a horrible movie. Make sure to avoid this turkey.
