To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. characteristic that appeared on the cable ad nasuem in the early nineties. The only thing noticeable about this feature was Duane Jones' latest movie. Other than that, there's no reason to watch this vampire movie unless you like pseudo-nana movies posing as a horror movie. A tired vampire aspires to love and searches in the alleys of L.A. Will he succeed or Vlad will he just start again as it did for the last century? <br /> <br /> This film must have been huge, as two sequels quickly followed. They are so bad that they make this one look like a classic. I know it's a movie about vampires, but filmmakers might be used to enlightening. <br /> <br /> This is not recommended by me because I did not like it. <br /> <br />
