Well. it was not a surprise. many people will tell you it's bloody. but they all speak "shiztz", this movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who makes a drink to feel no pain, he calls it "my son". found them a little weak. you can also skip 40 minutes of the film and go to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening. there are really stupid scenes in that. and they double the hits and slaps with a stupid fake slap that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. Keep looking for Gound Hounds. <br /> <br /> Check this option if you want a similar ending scene, lasting 20 to 10 minutes, which is not as surprising and presents a random scene of the type that tries to like the rape of his mother .. yeah That's strange.
