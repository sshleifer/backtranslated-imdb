It reminded me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. He has the same idea that people get what they deserve. I think it's always them in a Crypt story. The same goes for bad acting. Very bad game. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people did not like it and that I did not expect much. Whenever I watch a Stephen King film, I do not expect much, because all his films are awful compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love the way Carrie played as if it was a true story and the whole book is a pile of reports, theories and more. It was so good. But I noticed that the two novels did not look like movies. The ends were very different from the versions of the film. I suppose from these two novels that all his novels have changed a lot and that the ends are always lame. I end of thinner is the worst. So Cheesy. I want to read the book to discover the real end. I suggest to all those who intend to read Stephen King's novels to watch his movies in advance so you can compare. And in this way, you will be greatly satisfied with the book. I intend to do it with all his novels that have been turned into movies. I'm sure if they were turned into movies, they were really good books ... and the screenplay went terribly wrong.
