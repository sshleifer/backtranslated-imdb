I know that nobody cares, but me too. This film is historical for a reason. It is the unity of two heroes from two great sci-fi movies of the seventies. Well, one is great and the other pretty bad. The big is really great, in fact it's the best. The bad is really bad, in fact it's the worst. Of course, I'm talking about "Star Wars" and star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this movie about a kid who gets fired Vette then goes to Vegas (on a leash) and after a lot adventures, finally covers it. (Since he likes to repair cars, I guess you can call him "Lube Skywalker"). On the way, he meets a whore with a heart of gold and ends up facing a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the 1970s science fiction movie "Laserblast", which is, as I suggested earlier. , the worst sci-fi movie ever made. Milford plays the villain in the lead Hamill must steal his car. I realize that nobody cares about this meeting of two great heroes of science fiction, but it is the case. And I must also say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. Mark Hamill's acting game needs strength, the plot needs deep Jedi training, and Annie Potts' bitch character is perhaps the most annoying character of all time, in all the movies I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch on weekends or night on weekdays, late at night, very late. It's one of those movies that snakes, looks for something but does not quite find it and yet, at the same time, its main purpose is, like free-form jazz, to exist simply as it is. And it does it. And what's wrong, it's not terrible, but you can not say it's not fun, because for an hour and a half, you may feel scammed, but you do not you will not feel deceived. So turn off your mind, relax and enjoy this confused jewel without any waiting, and let the strength be with you, forever.
