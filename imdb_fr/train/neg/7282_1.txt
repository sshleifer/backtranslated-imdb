National Lampoon was once a fun magazine. Whether you like the beautiful hippie honeymoon days of the late sixties or the naughty and cheesy happy days of the seventies (when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked girls) depends a lot on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that in the early eighties, the Middle Ages had killed all the sparks of anarchic humor that remained, and offers such as this film and recordings increasingly terrible spin-offs revealed new holes in the hull. Apart from a beautifully illustrated title sequence, nothing to recommend to this particularly depressing stink bug. If you succeed in the disconcerting opening segment, "Growing up myself", hoping things will get better, no luck, they will not do it. Anyone who thought that the idea of ​​a woman brutally raped with a stick of butter was a golden comedy deserved to have her head turned on a messy dog ​​board. If there ever was a worldwide shortage of picks, the inconvenience of this incoherent incoherence of lousy ideas and terrible performance could be useful for something.
