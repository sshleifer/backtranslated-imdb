I do not understand why so many people have praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most annoying titles I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen all the episodes of Season 1 and the first episode of Season 2 simply. . <br /> <br /> 1) Where is induction in a criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In season 1, Agent Cooper threw stones at a bottle. Can you guess why he did that? He just wants to identify the murderer by making this "joke" while mentioning the supernatural ability given by the Tibet dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many useless scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, Season 2 started with a "fun" scene served by a mute old man Agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper is lying on the floor (he already has a bullet in the belly). This old man is just saying idiotic comments. That's all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 seconds ... it's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I'd like to read comics rather than see this show more.
