This film was a big disappointment for me. I've been waiting for this movie for years and I followed Chaos Comics faithfully until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut half of the story, but they altered the information. The claim that Lucifer is Hope's father is false. He has corrupted his father, but he himself is not his father. The voices did not suit the characters either, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be delivered. I can not even remember everything that was wrong with this movie. Bottom line, if you like Lady Death, do not watch this movie. It just did not do justice to the comic !!
