For each series that goes on television, 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are created and one, only one, reaches the production. From such a selection process, we are led to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series. <br /> <br /> And that goes with True Blood; all the stars were aligned and what began as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a game on the screen, a pilot and finally a series. Unfortunately, the trip can sometimes be long and, along the way, many turns ultimately change what was good and pure and show that the people of the production believe it would be better for the ratings. Oh, how often are they wrong ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has become one of the poorest, least beneficent and stupidest sub-intrigues, in the recent history of television. Its international distribution of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voice but continue to stumble on their false accents of the South. Alan Ball does not have a secret for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us a naked shot each week, although this often has nothing to do with the scenario. The characterization of Tara's angry black woman fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vampires will chase her away quickly before she launches into another speech about removing white while she's attending at a ceremony for the glorious Death of the Confederate. Sam experiences a suppressed love for Sookie and, all of a sudden, we must believe that he must watch over her morning, noon and night despite years of working with her and avoiding such relationships. <br /> <br /> As for Bill the vampire, his moral conscience is quickly put back at the first opportunity to make love with Sookie and is not afraid to give him a quick snack (although it remains unscathed). We find that other vampires are not as ordinary as Bill, but are eager to be accepted by an audience as they look at life as a happy meal with legs. <br /> <br /> Despite all my efforts to undergo the first six episodes. I realized that no matter how long you watch a bad show, it's always bad. Something dies for a reason, even vampires. Maybe this show should be.
