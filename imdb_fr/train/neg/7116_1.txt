* WARNING * Possible spoilers below <br /> <br /> The movie is more boring than anything else. There seem to be some attempts to create tension by poorly lit plans of empty rooms and empty lawns, but none of this works. <br /> <br /> MST3K did a pretty good job with, but the movie is in itself Most of the time tedious. <br /> <br /> Fun Moments: <br /> <br /> When the fake skull comes out of a pile of ashes, the woman becomes hysterical and nauseous while the husband (who tries to drive the crazy woman) said in an impassive voice, "There is no skull there, there is no skull." <br /> <br /> When the real ghost skulls make the husband take a pickle, as if they were stuck between the first and second goal.
