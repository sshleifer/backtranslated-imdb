In short, the film has a slightly weaker 1st act with some forced action and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and stimulation, much like a decent second act that has managed to create tension and intrigue despite inconsistencies and performance lower casting, and the 3rd act ... there was virtually no 3rd act! <br /> <br /> Regarding the 3rd act, the film ends abruptly. There is no resolution and no path leading to the top of the 2nd act, so there was not much of a 3rd act. The bad guys are dying and that's it; the end credits Nothing shows what happens to the protagonist and the secondary characters, etc. The audience would probably have left the cinema after the movie, asking "is that all?" A real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The music was composed by David Bell, who has worked enough to serve the movie most of the time, but it's certainly not exceptional. It's just functional, but achieves it by being simply generic and derivative. It is also obvious that the score is VERY dated with the use of synthesized timbales for some percussion. What impresses me the least in the score is that certain moments of tension announce musical signals reminding that they were torn from James Horner of "48 HRS". and "Commando", especially the brass. <br /> <br /> In all, the film had potential because the basic story itself was good, but the performance was dull with a mediocre direction, a weak game and a somewhat incoherent rhythm. <There was virtually no 3rd act to properly complete the story, and this omission is major and unforgivable because it does not allow the film to end satisfactorily. This could be the scenario or possibly the production should have cut the shooting or editing of the 3rd act in the finished film due to budget constraints (but I speculate on why there is no 3rd act ). Whatever the reason, the abrupt end really hurts the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> It's good for a view if you are curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap, as well as to find out why you need 3 acts (early, middle, late) if you write scripts and make movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version to at least laugh heartily.
