I had the chance to read the book before seeing the film. It was a teenage epic, a dream of past summers, a great independent film potential or a big-budget drama. It fell into the hands of a pirate, who clearly took notes by watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything at all. The scenario loses the flesh of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low gags. I'm sorry for the actors, because the characters in the book were rich and textured, but reduced to annoying characters in the movie. Like Dylan Baker, Mason Gamble is great when the opportunity arises, but the skeleton that remains of the story unfolds like a bad one after school. The poor = GOOD, the rich = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it's worth watching to see the beach in Southern California where Gary Sinise parks his caravan which must pass for a Delaware bay. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassing turning point for the director for the first time, Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
