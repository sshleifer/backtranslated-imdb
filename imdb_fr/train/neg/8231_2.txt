MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... BUT DOUBT CAN BE REALLY GIBLI! !!. <br /> <br /> Five on the other side of the eyes can be summed up in one word ... Amateur. This film tries to differentiate itself from most movies of the type "Blair Witch shooting" ... it does not work ... it ends up looking like someone who had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist has no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a tracksuit over the five girls) and there is no violence strictly speaking ... nothing but the sounds of screams and crunches. The entire film takes place inside a van, which means that decent landscapes are out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what's been given to them, but overall, they look like pretty bad actresses ... although with the material it's hard to judge if they can really to play ... they pass all the film screaming, screaming and moaning ... so much that half the time it's hard to understand what's been said and the cameras are so bad that it's actually hard to tell who said it. This video comes as a violent torture film but actually represents only five girls in a truck screaming in terror ... which literally sums up the film as a whole ..... we then come to the end after what seems to be 5 hours ceaseless cries and the five girls are still alive ... with one finger less. The only bravo (get it ... finger ... LOL) is for poor actresses who have done their best and who have probably lost their voice (and their pride) after shooting this terrible movie. Do not judge this by the poster ... you will be very disappointed.
