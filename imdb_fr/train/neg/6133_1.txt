Kurt Thomas interprets as Jonathan Cabot a kind of gymnast who trains for a special game that involves being pursued by a group of ninjas, but these ninjas will have no chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! Taken as a whole, Gymkata is a helluva bad movie, the atrocious game, the horrible scenario and the really incompetent direction make the quality below the human standards, but this movie is so terrible that it becomes really, really funny. I mean with a dialogue such as "I know I'm going to fall asleep!" or "Ha!, your through!" only add to the dummy value that Gymkata gets over then. In addition, it's the only film that has a hero, a gymnast who finds things to move on.
