First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this movie is just like my resume. The biggest shit bag of all time. At first, Chris Rock embodies a budding comedian who has stage fright in a comedy building called Apollo. Returning home after a concert, while riding a motorcycle, he sees the woman he loves and is hit by a truck. Shortly after, he chooses the body of an old white, selfish millionaire. Then he dresses up as the Outkast band while trying to replay the original scene where he goes out as a Jockey. Secondly, he returns to the Apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body. Do you have my drift? This film is awful, it is too much effort to look like the original and, in doing so, it looks like a bag of shit. Follow my advice, do not even watch this movie.
