I'm absolutely dismayed to see that the average rating for this movie is 5.2 / 10. As far as I'm concerned, it's certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I always wonder why I'm doing it. I watched until the end. First of all, the plot is totally hopeless and the acting is really horrible. I think a totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci; As far as Mr. Kamar Del's Reyes is concerned, I think it would have been a better choice for him to stay in his "Doll Valley". In summary, it is a waste of time (and I try to stay polite ...) to avoid at all costs. My rating is 1 and I still think it's well paid, but as we can not give an O ....
