This film has little to recommend, although it is breathtaking landscapes, cinematography and the direction of wildlife, it is difficult to discuss its weaknesses in the company of such criticism rave. However, it is precisely these factors that make the absence of a conspiracy satisfactory and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this with my kids and none of us was too impressed by the end. Yes, the pictures were beautiful, the vast landscapes through the forest and the beautiful mountains, but what was happening in the foreground? The stupid narration of the stupidity of a tasteless girl who is learning too slowly a very basic lesson about friendships with wildlife - and who is doing pretty easily given the antecedents of this stuff. This is certainly not a new story, in fact, the way it is told is nothing new, and we have all seen it before, and much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. <br /> <br /> The only thing to really glean from this film is an idea of ​​how to work with these beautiful lenses and this forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
