An extremely thin "plot" of satanic rituals, or such a demon, provides the hokey excuse for donning copious amounts of sex scenes. Vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest and some other sexual proliferations are at the center of our concerns. The problem is that the scenario is so dull that endemic sexuality becomes quite tedious after a while. Who knew that a movie with an intimate meeting of goat / girl could be so boring? Well now I do it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line provides T & A (both exposed quite often); the spectators are entitled to an occasional penis. <br /> <br /> My note: D + <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: "Pick Up" trailers, "Legend of Eight Samourai", "Do not Answer the phone "," Prime Evil "and" Sister Street Fighter "(the same DVD also contains a second feature film" Evil Eye ")
