Why oh why can not anyone make a decent movie from a legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" with which I was disappointed in a year. But I must say that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel", with Gerald Butler) was far superior to this one. This one was only a little disappointing. This one is a mess! <br /> <br /> What disturbed me the most? Are these useless plot elements that they added for no particular reason (human sacrifices? Interestless love interest?), Or bad CGI, or incoherent characters or non-acting acting inspired? Worse, they made the beautiful Marina Sirtis so horrible !!! And do not even talk about this ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why did they always remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men and that he had never shown any sign of such force throughout the film? He was tossed by the two monsters he was fighting, relying on his acolytes to save his bacon. Even when he hit the arrogant prince, he did not knock him out. He was far too dependent on weapons. Beo-Wimp is more like that. It certainly was not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end on a positive note, but I can not think of another. All I can say is that if you have already read "Beowulf", you will be infinitely disappointed by this lamentable and inaccurate excuse for an adaptation!
