We loved School of Rock and Jack Black. We could not wait to see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad that I wanted to leave. My husband hated him too. The only fun parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stay in front of the cinema and tell people to save money. The writing was awful. He had all the terrible stereotypes of Hispanic people who should be completely offended. The film was not long, but it seemed like an eternity. The theater people were so agitated and silent that it was like watching the paint dry. I had my husband stay because I was sure there might be some parties who bought, but that was not the case. Save money and your time.
