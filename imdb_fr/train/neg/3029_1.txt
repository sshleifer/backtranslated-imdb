From the first moment, this "thing" is just a terrible sequence of extremely short scenes of blurry work in the camera. While the overall plot has all the potential for a thriller, the story is so badly told that I am unable to buy it. From the middle of the film, the actions of the characters have no meaning for me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea of ​​getting Edna to make coffee for them after pulling his son's arm is well below his alleged experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino does not question the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams following a phone line break. Should not she be wary for a long time of Williams making them? These FBI agents seem to have the crazy spirit of arriving with a single helicopter at something that they have every reason to consider a shooting in the mafia of the capital. Moreover, what they do by concealing and disclosing information to Cigliutti is, in a way, an incitement to murder; it seems like a goodbye to justice if the FBI conducts its investigations in the same way. In reality, they would act like that. We see a car accident that would normally have at least seriously hurt if it did not kill most of the passengers, but miraculously left them with only a few bruises. On the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino who makes love to Choco, who, from Domino's point of view, is in no way founded by previous events, but simply by being drugged up to the eyes . <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes From Claremont's phone call, Williams seems just as eager to be a dramatic dazzle. This combined with the awful and uncomfortable camera work only creates a piece that I hesitate to call a movie. I am sorry for the useless effort of the main actors, whose talent is out of the question.
