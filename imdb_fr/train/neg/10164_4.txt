I just saw that at the Venice Film Festival and I can not really decide. We have never been allowed to get close enough to the characters to worry about it. Maybe it was the fact that we are all in a personal "bubble", but these people did not make me worry or shock them. At about one hour of running, the characters were not very developed. A lot of time has been spent on plant equipment plans (forklift trucks, conveyor belts, excavators); and the slightly scary baby dolls with amazingly realistic eyes, which most characters earned for a living, were somehow more interesting than living things. An interesting experience, but in a way, it never fully materialized.
