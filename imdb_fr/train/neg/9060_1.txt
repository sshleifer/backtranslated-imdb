Surf chain and caught this on the logo. It was one of those moments "I have to watch this because it's so horribly bad", like Roadhouse without the joy. The writing is atrocious; completely stupid and the acting is uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> There is a reduced budget, then there is the abyss where this epic should be launched and never seen again. I mean, the main characters go to a ski retreat in a rented house and the house is, well, ordinary, which does not matter, but they choose to show all the guests pouring in as if was the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry but watching 6 guys watch every 10'x10 'boring piece with a futon in it and gushing is nil. I guess they did not learn anything from Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see the hotel check scene) ... wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy sound everywhere, so everything is in the routine. If it smells ... and looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> edit: Apparently, other more enthusiastic critics I believe that since I do not like this movie, I am an "obvious enemy", which I can only assume, that wants to say that I am phobic, which of course is not true. I decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the movie and not its mere presence (that is, refreshing to see ...) <br /> Of course It may be refreshing to see, but that does not mean it's a good movie, but give them better work materials and more precise direction. In fact, I applaud the effort. Frankly, I'd rather listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalog than watch again.
