A typical 70's Italian movie, original and good music, but with some quirks, an interesting but not fantastic photograph, a mediocre and sometimes confused scenario (for example, the role of the wolf-dog, and where does the boy come from? ?) with a mediocre dialogue, a good atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The reason he's still (relatively) known and sought after is probably the nude scene (including a typical 70s pseudo-coitus) featuring an 11 and 13 year old girl with a older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it is interesting from a sociopolitical point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the United States ) 30 years ago, when he is now more than taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the intimidation of one girl (Laura) by the two other characters and her discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of an aspect of teenage life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not evolve until the very end of the film and already appears very well versed in the erotic arts - there is no "majority" for her: it is a very vain girl and already conscious of her sexual charms, but eventually is just used and ends the movie crying like the little girl she is still. The boy is a totally despicable tyrant, while Laura appears as a very naive and weak victim.
