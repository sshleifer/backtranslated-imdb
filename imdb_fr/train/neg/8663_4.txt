Just when you thought you could safely return to the water ... <br /> <br /> Another computer-generated mutant croc is on the lookout for human meat, left behind by another of these establishments leading a crazy science. Gereco Biotech has fun with research on growth hormone, accidentally releasing a baby crocodile that is changing at an accelerated pace. <br /> <br /> The B-movie cast adds a fun twist to this run of the plant "Genetic error" monster movie. "Costas Mandylor conjures Mick Dundee, Australian accent, hat, big knife, works, as a croco specialist hired by Gereco's leader, Joanna Pacula (.. lost in the stereotypical role of the corrupt administrative leadership who denies any involvement in the gigantic beast she has to leave free on innocent people.) Charles Napier is the sheriff of the city whose city is in danger, and Jane Longenecker is his daughter who works at the animal shelter, Matthew Borlenghi, star of soap opera, is the love interest of Longenecker, a local artist who welds his brother is a victim of the fang.) Of course, this skill will be of great use when our heroes install a trap created for the fang, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. / > <br /> The fang itself is never convincing since it unleashes through a reserve in search of food, the special effects of a variety of low quality. As for Roger Corman's productions dealing with renegade dino-monsters, I remain faithful to Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on its hind legs, often standing up while pursuing potential victims. I felt that Mandylor and the filmmakers were accusing Crocodile Dundee with his crocodile hunter, and this imitation could amuse the monster himself. Borlenghi and Longenecker have a very good chemistry together on screen. As expected, Pacula receives his expense in a hilarious way (gulp).
