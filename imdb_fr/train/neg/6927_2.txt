Although I rated this film as a 2 for having demonstrated a total lack of effort to try to create a quality horror movie, it was a 10 on a fun and unintentional scale. I could not understand what was going on in the movie or who the characters were but I did not care, because I knew that every scene was going to have something that made me cry with laughter. The dialogue is a minimum throughout the film but I think it's because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot makes the film extremely versatile. It does not matter if you watch the movie from start to finish or watch the movie rewinding, you'll be confused. I particularly like the scene in which the inmates run in turn, beating each other with sticks. I think the doctor calls it a treatment. Genius!
