An idiotic dentist discovers that his wife has been unfaithful. So, no new story here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid and disgusting movie. If you like to watch children throwing up, or if you see a dentist imagining that he is pulling all the teeth of his wife in a bloody horror movie, go see (or rent) the movie. If not, move on (my fairy, anyone?)
