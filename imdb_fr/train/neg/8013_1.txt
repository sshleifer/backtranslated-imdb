One would think that a film about adolescence confronting its nascent homosexuality would be anything but boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it is about ten times more potent than any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the filmmaker * was planning * to make a film, but was becoming lazy and decided instead to launch a series of random images (and BORING BORING) and Go-Nowhere scenes, to stage some real scenes featuring real actors. this good lighting is not important in the process of making the film, and wrap it under the auspices of a movie "arthouse". This is exactly a kind of rotten product that allows many traditional filmmakers to poop the independent film movement, and that prevents the general public from more easily adopting independent films. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in movies that cover this topic, you'd better look at some of the great short films available on the Logo website or rent Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, avoid this long piece of dreck.
