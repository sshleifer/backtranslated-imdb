I write this review after watching it several months ago ... the trailer seemed promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. It's a complete joke ... and literally spit on the real classics of the first generation of horrors like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), to which they even had the nerve to compare themselves to the back of the cover. The producer who played Brandon should go burgers and serve greasy hamburgers ... damn it, he may not even be good at it! The lighting was bad, bad and a big bother in the movie, we could not even see the face of the actor sometimes. I do not even remember the rest of the cast, which is really sad. They never do anything to impress you and make them memorable. That's all the time I'm going to lose in this review, PLEASE, stay as far as you can from this pile of junk, even if you get it for 25 cents, do not do it not. If you want quality entertainment on a budget, much better than that ... then discover a movie by Jeff Hayes .... because it takes talent to make him horrified and the kid has it! br /> <br /> I gave this star 1 just for the cover art .... it's the only thing that is worth loving to like what is called a "movie" < br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
