Painful to watch, and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters. Two of the main characters, Cynthia the mother and Monica, the recognized girl, respectively spend most of the film in a pathetic mewing and a bitter bitch. Their characters are so firmly established that their conversion into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is incredible. It was not worth the wait. I hope that a dignified speech among the families is less of a puzzle to behold.
