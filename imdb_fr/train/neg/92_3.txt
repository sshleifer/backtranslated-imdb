Really, I can not believe I spent $ 5 for this movie. I'm a big fan of zombies and I thought the movie could not be so bad. There were zombies in there, right? I was wrong! To be honest, the film had its moments ... I thought it was cool when the guy got ripped off, but that was about it. Overall, I think it would be nicer to slide a razor blade on my naked backpack into a vinegar tub and then watch that movie again. The film could have been better if we could see breasts, but I had to watch the trailers of other films produced by this company to see that. Beware of buyers ... unless you are in masochism.
