What a shame that a director as competent as Andr√© de Toth, a specialist in slippery and changing alliances, did not understand this concept first. He could have helped reveal the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. In the current state of the film, it is a real disaster (as stated by the critic Chipe). The main issues are management, a cheap budget and a poor scenario. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept - characters drawn in different directions by conflicting forces. What was needed was a person with enough vision to gather the positive elements by reworking the script into a sort of coherent whole, instead of the sprawling and delicate jumble that it is (try to understand the motivations and interactions if you can). In addition, a larger budget could have matched studio shots and contrasting places, and take the scene of the too obvious suburb of LA. The real shame lies in the waste of an excellent cast - Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth are capped), Dehner, Reeves, as well as James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely death. Few films further illustrate the importance of an author with a vision that this obscure and obscure Westerner, who, in good hands, could have been much more.
