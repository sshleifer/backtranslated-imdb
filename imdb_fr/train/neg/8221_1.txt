This "film" tries to follow the kind of low-budget portable camera films that have proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one fails and HOW. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see how many so-called "rewards" have been plastered on the cover of this junk ..... one wonders how were these critics when they actually submitted this ... . <br /> <br /> The words do not describe how terrible this movie is. Seriously, it's THAT BAD. <br /> <br /> I watched it in 20 minutes flat, almost always fast forward. <br /> <br /> From garbage lighting to the redoubtable direction, grainy visuals to the muffled sound, Of course, without forgetting the acting game ABYSMAL, it was a piece completely and totally pathetic of the so-called cinematic realization. <br /> <br /> It's serious, it has NO quality that redeems, whatever. Save your money and watch a low budget horror movie, there are many - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name a few. <br /> <br /> AVOID this garbage at all costs. DO NOT waste your money or time on this bin claiming to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Take note of all the other comments! You have been warned!
