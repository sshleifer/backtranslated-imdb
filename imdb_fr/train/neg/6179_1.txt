This movie is the second worst film I have ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no conspiracy, climax, conflict or any other major detail needed to describe a story. This "movie" is just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his manly side and the "tough guy he really is". I completely lost my time watching this movie. The best part should be the end credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my thumbs and threw them at the producers. Whoever had the reason to give Toby Keith the chance to play in a feature film is obviously at the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could very well be the only thing you regret.
