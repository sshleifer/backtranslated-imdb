I'm sorry but it's just awful. I've talked to people about this film and some of the bad actors in it and they almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with that, the Japanese troops of the modern era are drawn in the past at the time of the Busido warriors and, with their modern weapons, are at the height of almost everything. When the troops realize for the first time that something strange is happening, should each person in the back of the transport say "Hey, my watch stopped"? Imagine lines like this one being repeated more than 15 times before you say anything and you have the film's lack of grandeur in a nutshell.
