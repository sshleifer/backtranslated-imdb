I'm afraid I do not like this movie a lot. Apart from some saving grace, there is nothing to say. <br /> <br /> J-horror has exploded over the past five or six years, but the movies themselves have repeatedly been repetitive copies and true copies of a previous hit. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning is promising with frightening scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes sewn graphically, but opens them soon after. However, after that, the descent is fast for this movie. <br /> <br /> To be nice, I'll start with the things I like in "Gawi". On the positive side, the visuals are loud and the film looks good for its type. For those who love their bloody horror movies, there are some murder scenes well executed (no pun intended). We also have some good suspense sequences. <br /> <br /> However, there are some disadvantages too ... <br /> <br /> First, and my main complaint about this movie is that the plot jumps and advance forward and backward with alarming intensity. Generally, this is not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same, regardless of their age, I was confused on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> The performances are correct, I guess (hard to say when you do not know the language), but you seem a little stiff. And for a horror movie, I do not think it was scary enough. For a moment, I was really bored. <br /> <br /> As a fan of giallo movies, I was expecting a lot of "Nightmare", but unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.
