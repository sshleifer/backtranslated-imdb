I just finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I must say it was such a pile of rubbish. The first 3 American pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not be called American Pie. <br /> <br /> As you understood in the title of the movie, Beta House speaks of a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of all, falling in love. Of course, Stifler is the guy who succeeds with girls. With his comrades, he tries to complete another seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and super wrong. It's just really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college are fighting over who gets everything (something like that). To summarize: awful actor + dull scenario + misuse of the American Pie franchise = total loss of time! This film is unbearable. I give it a two out of ten, although most of it sucks there was a lot of nudity and pretty girls, like 2 fun scenes :)
