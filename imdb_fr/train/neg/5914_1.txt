This movie is really boring. It has been banned in Chinese cinema and I understand why. It is not because he criticizes the communist regime, but simply because the film is of mediocre quality. I would never pay to watch that. I love the movies of Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am disappointed that such a mediocre film can come out of China. He seems to totally ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the film for himself. The plans of a person who does nothing for a minute are hilarious and plentiful. The quality of cinematography and video is incredibly bad. I watched this movie on the net and it seems that people really like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some moviegoers think that if a movie is not in English, it is automatically good. I do not see any reason why people would like that. it's not a film of art, it's a waste of celluloid.
