This movie is AWFUL! I do not even know where to start, I'm speechless, I can not even describe how awful it is. The blood is first blossoming, and the acting is AWFUL! The only good thing was the biker chick that saved the day. This film was ridiculous, I do not see how it could even get a vote of 1 it's so bad. It looks like it was made by high school students.
