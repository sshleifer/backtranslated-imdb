The person who wrote the critical review of this lost project must be related to the writer / director / star - or is, in fact, the same person, because it defies the rational thought that this film would please anyone not related to a very closely interwoven inner circle. What do you say about that? You want to make a movie - tell a story; to entertain; draw me with lively characters. Of course, you can do it cleverly without bending to commercial elements designed to attract mass. However, do not address the elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the public continually struggles to grasp lean narrative threads. If I am moved by a dream psychological thread, then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.
