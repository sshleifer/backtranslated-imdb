... and I've seen bad ones. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this film. The acting game is poor by Jennifer Tilly - to predict. Daryl Hannah is doing a decent job, but nothing is close to saving this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw of this film is that the plot is so weak - even if it's based on good premises - that resorted to the "stupid heroine's trick" to create a suspense artificial. When all that Daryl Hannah should do is hide, she runs in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing too much of what is happening to a plot, I think it would be difficult for a small, bleeding woman to transport a pregnant woman from the hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very lame. <br /> <br /> Save time and choose another movie.
