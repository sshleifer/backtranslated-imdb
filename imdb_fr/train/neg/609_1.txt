It was an absolutely terrible movie. Do not be attracted to Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are excellent actors, but it must be simply their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem the ridiculous scenario of this film. This film is an American propaganda document of the early 90s. The most pathetic scenes are those where the Colombian rebels defended the cause of the revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso seemed false, and her story of pseudo-love with Walken was nothing more than a pathetic cork in a movie devoid of any meaning. I'm disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining the actor like Christopher Walken. I could hardly sit across.
