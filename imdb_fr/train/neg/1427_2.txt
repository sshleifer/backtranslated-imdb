The British series Claymation putting "spiritual" conversations recorded by "average" people in the mouths of "cute" fancy creatures had at least the advantage of giving non-British viewers a semblance of humor and the kind of humor grown and rarefied that you could not get. American television. Someone made the mistake of putting it on American television. <br /> <br /> A bit like the sadly sublime American version of the sublime Brit-com COUPLING, who died in a month on NBC while the same basic scripts did not "translate" it from English British to American English, which seemed funny and cultured (and just a bit dull) in England, appears in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, as a simple boredom with puppets. There is no plot, no characters, and after one and a half episode (of the three shown in the end), no reason to suffer any more. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about the new summer series and the very short series it has shown is that the focus is made at least professionally and that it is the organization of the worst show in the CBS series, The New Adventures of Old Christine (or "how to be a horrible mother" - or a person - in an endless lesson and not very funny "), children who wanted to stay awake after their happily ran to bed instead of sitting during this show, and adults could wait until 9pm for "Two and a half men" (guilty pleasure) and "How I met your mother" (writing real quality).
