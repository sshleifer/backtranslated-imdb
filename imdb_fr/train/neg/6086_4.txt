For some reason, in the late '70s and early' 80s, the local CBS affiliated channel in New York continued to play this movie late on Friday or Saturday night for several years, usually at 2 am or almost. It is a suitable film for this time slot because it is very difficult to follow and quite strange (see other reviews for specific information on the story). Anyway, after seeing it several times at that time, just before the cable TV (and even after, but before the channel was broadcast), I continued to catch this little quirk. After not having seen it for many years, I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it's only available (from all the research I've done anyway) in a rather ugly print on the budget label "Brentwood Video" as part of a 4-pack ( 4 movies on 2 double-sided discs) called "Alien Worlds" if anyone is interested. It is usually available for around $ 10, but even less if you shop around. The other 3 films in this set are easily available in many other public domain film collections. So you do not need to comment on them here. But I did not see "Eyes" available elsewhere. Although not a "restored" version, this print takes exactly 92 minutes. Therefore, for once, the running time indicated by IMDb of 90 minutes is not correct. Even with the duration of 92 minutes, it is not uncommon for a film dubbed in English from another language to also have some of the processing time. Saving money by taking care not to double scenes at all if they are not considered important to the story seems to be a common budget practice. Would a longer version make it less confusing? Who really knows - unless you've seen it in his mother tongue ... By the way, my attempts to look at this during the day do not work and I just end it off. There is something about watching this in the middle of the night that fits this movie..or maybe it's just from my previous experiences, who knows ??
