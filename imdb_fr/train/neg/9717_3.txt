A rather obvious thriller, in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding place for nothing. I was mainly looking at Isabelle Huppert's performance in English. It was not great, but it was a strange role. I would not be surprised if it turned out that half of his contribution had been left on the floor of the cutting room with several rewrites of last-minute screenplay. <br /> <br /> The acting game is the least attractive in this film. . Steve Guttenburg seems to try to clarify his role with the charm that everyone tells him. There is a sensationally stupid sequence in which it is suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat PTSD. It's a performance without interest. Elizabeth McGovern is rather a draw with an authentic charm and character, but it's a small consolation. 3/10
