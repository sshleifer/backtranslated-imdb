I did not agree with any of the theologies of the Left Behind series, but I nevertheless found the books captivating and read 8 of the 12 of them. Undeniably good writing and interesting story. However, I did not have high expectations for the film. There was no chance that the Hollywood public would engage in a Christian series and produce a big-budget movie. So it was done independently ... and I felt like watching a very long TV show. It just did not look like a movie; he did not have that movie "experience" if anyone knows what I'm talking about. So the film suffered and the special effects limited by a limited budget and a low cost were another disadvantage for me. <br /> <br /> On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie has been terribly misinterpreted by Nicolai Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be that charming, dazzling, incredibly handsome man who spoke English with almost no accent. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found Clay Aiken's nude pencil that looked like a Best Buy employee of the month and gave him a very bad false accent. So, that lost some stars to me there. A movie is simply not convincing when the major villain does not look or sound like he is supposed to do. <br /> <br /> The acting game was going well, but there is nothing to write. Some scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (I can not remember which one) - were real seats. And some of the Christian rock music or anything was really out of place for certain scenes, like the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it was not a bad movie, but it did not do it for me. Stick to the book, people are much better.
