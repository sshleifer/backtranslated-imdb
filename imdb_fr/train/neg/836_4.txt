A fan dedicated to TLK films, the first being a milestone event and the second, probably the best suite that Disney has produced, accompanies this film. no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere. Although it is not bad, it does not add anything. Basically, this movie is a big joke ... and that's about all that saves it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
