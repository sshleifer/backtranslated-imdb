This could be a good candidate for "The Worst Flick Ever". Maybe without John Hurt, the film could be tolerated. However, the TRAGEDY of all this project is that John Hurt, one of the biggest actors on the screen, is shrinking himself in this area ... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt S ' IS SHOWN ... I take off 8 points because he did not run away fast enough. As for the rest of the distribution, they are simply terrible. Janine Turner, as pretty as she is, can not act to save her soul. And the main actor is, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment, do it. It's so bad, it's almost painful.
