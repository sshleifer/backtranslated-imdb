I am a big fan of B5, which only became known at the end of the third season. I watched faithfully all previous seasons at the time of the subscription, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought narrative arcs ever to have been shown on television. Even the filling episodes were interesting. The movies, too, were well produced and as entertaining as anything that could be shown in theaters. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to "River of Souls". Of course, after seeing everything, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen seems to be playing in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious science fiction story. The story itself might have been beautiful in plan form, even in the screenplay. However, it is obvious that the moment has come to incorporate this notion into a two-hour film. There are no special effects to entertain us in the complete absence of a fascinating story. There are places where they obviously lacked time and simply improvised the dialogue to complete the story. If it had been the regular season, it would have been ranked among the worst episodes.
