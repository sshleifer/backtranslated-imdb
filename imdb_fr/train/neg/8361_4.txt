-SPOILES- South Blade of the Border is an adventure film that has something to do with the blackmail of a leader of the big cooperative, Rosenlski, president of Unasco Inc., by David Ziegler, one of the best on the beach, which lives the life of Reilly or Ziegler on his beach Having this CD, which he gave to his brother James, has three years of telephone conversations between Rosenlski and the President of the United States involved in criminal cases. This CD gave David an edge over the international gangsters who follow him. <br /> <br /> The fact that James is a little greedy trying to shake Rosenlski for 2 million diamonds has cost him his life, but he also threatened David with losing his own. Ropsenlski wants to negotiate the CD with David by having his ex-wife Liz tell him to abandon him. Rosnelski spent a market to pay off her debts if she got away with it. David is later killed by Tony, Rosenliski's Mexican hit, with the help of a great white shark, who simply will not respond to all these peaceful transactions from his boss. <br /> <br /> Tony had taken the CD that Liz had left to his boss in a local hotel vault and now wanted to murder James, as he had done with David, and at the same time keep the CD for to have something on Rosenlski. <br /> <br /> David, who secretly hid the diamonds that James had on him at the time of his assassination, is now the target of Tony and his men to silence him forever. David also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time give his chief Rosenlski the impression that the CD that David lost is used, but use it later, without Rosenlski knowing who is behind, to make him sing. <br /> <br /> The movie "Shark Night" contains a lot of shark attacks with this huge one-eyed white shark that ends up eliminating about half a dozen cast members, including Tony. David, a firm believer in gun control, uses powerful explosives and Molotov cocktails, as well as his fists, to eliminate Tony's crew. Even the killer shark is finished by Tony but with a hunting knife, not a gun. When it came to using firearms to save his friend and acolyte Paco, a girlfriend, Juanita, and his priest, Father Mattia lives off Tony. His guns were a no-no with David. he was more a knife and a lance man than anything else. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was about as predictable as possible. David thought he had been killed by a one-eyed shark and then emerged from the crowd, after Rosenlski was convinced he had died leaving the village. David continues his life as a free and loving beachcomber, without anyone trying to kill him and about two million richer dollars. to David's credit, he had asked his friend Paco to return his CD to Rosenski, but on condition that, if something happened to him, his cousin, that Rosenlski did not know who he was and where he would be, he would unleash and let the world know about his dirty and criminal relationships.
