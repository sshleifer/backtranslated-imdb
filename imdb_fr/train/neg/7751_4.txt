First of all, the CGI in this movie was horrible. I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. In the end, when the park owner is killed, this is probably one of the worst CGI examples I've ever seen. Even the night of the undead had a better animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie had almost no plot. Why were they on this particular island? Well, it was not indicated in the movie. And why do people continue to enter the cat zone? It does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> One of the things that made the difference in this film was a very good acting. In what we could call a movie "B made for TV movie", the acting was very good. Parry Shen was particularly distinguished. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. This can be good for some memorable quotes.
