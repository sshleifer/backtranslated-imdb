I watched an episode. Yes, I have experienced all this miserable experience and I must say that this comedy is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin from Family Guy. Now, imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (albeit a thin one and less glasses), except that he is missing something that has made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he's an idiot. Sarah does not have the authentic character, nor the actress ability to withdraw her character. Maybe it's the banal and stereotypical jokes that draw her comedy even lower than her character can take her alone. Maybe it's the lack of credible leaves. His bigoted character, insensitive, can appeal to bigoted people, insensitive, unlike the mass appeal that has the character insensible, bigot Stephen Colbert. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates a boring and funny character. It lacks something necessary for the kind of satire, let alone for the world of comedy. What is missing from Sarah Silverman is remarkable. And when you do not believe it and do not identify yourself, it's not funny anymore.
