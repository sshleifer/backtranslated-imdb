Lesbian vampire movie about a couple on vacation who stays on the ground of what they think is an empty mansion but is really used as a pair of lesbian vampires. While the vampires bring an occasional victim, the couple go about their business until the two groups unite together. <br /> <br /> A great movie with two very sexy women like vampires provide to recommend this cult movie. Yes, it's a sexy vampire story. No, it's not interesting beyond women. To be honest, there's a reason why I've seen footage of this movie in horror books and magazines: it's great, but other than that ... <br /> <br /> For those who want to see only sexy vampires.
