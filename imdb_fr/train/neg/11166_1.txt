I'm sure that in the recesses of Jack Blacks, the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious, but no, this is not the case. You can say that old Jacks have the chance to play in a slender and slimy Mexican monk with the dream of becoming a wrestler, but this movie is a failure in almost every department. <br /> <br /> I sat around most of the movie thinking "Is this supposed to be funny" and "This is the Tenacious D guy, is not it?" The truth is that this movie has nothing to offer. AT ALL! It's a ugly scenario with crappy characters and a game and a really bad direction. You will see endless moments where you think something fun is about to happen, but that is not the case. I got bored stupid about 10 minutes, but it sure would be ok. It does not have. 90 minutes later, I had barely managed to avoid such a painful aneurysm. <br /> <br /> It's like, remember years ago that you saw anything with your favorite actor, even some of their first celebrity movies, and you'd really be embarrassed to see that this actor was actually in such a plop load. Yes, it is like that. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Jack Black's previous films like Shallow Hall and I can not wait to see Pick of Destiny, but go for it. If you do this again, Jack, I'll have to come and hammer your kneecap or something. At least, discuss seriously. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons ....
