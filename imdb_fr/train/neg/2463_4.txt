I do not know how to describe this movie. It's certainly one of the strangest movies I've seen in a long time. It is very disturbing at times but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and can attract anyone who loves gore and splashing. I found myself gritting my teeth in some of the scenes above. What is clever with the film is that it plays with our fears and that The Dentist is therefore quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> The humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you're a lover of weird and strange animations and you have your teeth in the air, it's just the movie you're looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and you are attracted by this kind of animation Try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a bit too weird for my taste)
