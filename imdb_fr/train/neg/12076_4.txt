You all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "to be or not to be" (not the speech itself) has been beaten so often that it is not very interesting (in fact, it was not not terrible to start). In fact, I find "Hamlet" a good game but largely overestimated. This is not even the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with "The dream of a summer night" and "Othello" not too far behind. "Macbeth (hit your table, drawers, the puck will fix, OW!)" Is not that bad either. Shakespeare has many more. <br /> <br /> I will not comment much on the film, I will dissect rather the horrible episode of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Okay. . Mike and the Bots win a deck of cards. Choose the movie. . . they ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them this, yadda yadda yadda. . . and get ready for the most boring Sci-Fi episode of MST3K (without a doubt, I have not seen any of the CC Ones). <br /> <br /> While "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" makes viewing this episode horrible because it's not really a movie, but spliced ​​scenes (I remember Mike's line of " Future War ":" Maybe it's an anthology of short films without intrigue "), the SOL Crew has many had a lot of good cracks. The same can not be said for here. <br /> <br /> The riffs fall flat, the segments of the host (as usual) are mediocre at best, and when the movie itself (which is not so bad) is actually BETTER (I mean, as a quality movie, not as a camp, like "Prince of Space") as the MST3K version, you know that the series has to be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw this a few months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried AND TRIED to be entertained - but I just could not. Only the casual line, like "Hello Queen Dilbert's boss!" (and when it's the funniest part of the episode, well, ahem) - and occasionally, I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe even laughing. The second time I tried to watch it, I did not even laugh at some jokes that I had found funny before, but I just gave up forty minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> The film is not horrible; it's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are pretty good, and although the dubbing is not the best, it is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, yes THREE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY WHY, MST3K!
