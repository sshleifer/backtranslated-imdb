Such a waste! This film could have been really decent, but writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather superficial and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good and the pageant of the late '70s was well designed, but overall it was a big waste of time. Instead, the movie to watch, which deals with similar themes and the same basic calendar, is the great BOOGIE NIGHTS.
