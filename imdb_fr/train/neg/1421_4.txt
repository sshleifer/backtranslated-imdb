I praised Lensman's doubled English version, in the hope that since it was known novels he would have substance. Although there have been hints of substance in the film, it has not generally gone beyond the level of the children's cartoon. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or he lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the source novels were light. But for some reason, there was not much there. <br /> <br /> I noticed many derivative details, loose, badly dramatized or deficient. Some examples: The opening scenes seemed to be borrowed from the "Star Gate" scene of 2001 and the image of the hyperspace Star Wars. The harvester's robot looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> He begins by trying to borrow his comic relief style from Star Wars, but fortunately (since humor does not work), he gives up on comedy and plays serious. In this sense, it is superior to the Star Wars franchise, which began with a sense of intelligent humor, then deteriorated to the point of becoming a boring fool. <br /> <br /> The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who saw a farm. The harvester was crossing the middle of an unharvested field, dumping silage on unharvested crops, rather than working from one side to the other and dumping silage on already harvested lines or in a truck. Maize (corn) was flowing into the grain bin, but farmland was drawn like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When the time came for Kim's father to face his fate, the weight was not dramatic. at the scene. This could have been partly the fault of the English-speaking voice actor, but the drawings did not show much weight either. Kim's reactions in this scene were also unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently supposed to be close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler, his name is not revealed before the scene of his death.) She seems to forget it quickly. The expression of sympathy expressed by someone shows more feeling than it does. I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in this case; there is at least a hint of feeling in Chris's drawings. <br /> <br /> Many times, villains fail to execute their orders. An evil leader often punishes these failures of miserable deaths. I can not say if it comes from Star Wars, or if it comes from an earlier source - maybe Lensman's books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene where a spaceship crashes. When it plunges to the ground, parts are detached from the ship. But there are so many pieces falling that there should not be anything left before landing. <br /> <br /> If in most cases, Chris seems to be a competent and tough space hero, there is a scene where she screams an incompetent damsel in distress. Someone strong enough to overcome Henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to scream, "help me, it's good for me and I can not reach my gun!" Instead of screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with the most personality (almost too often sometimes) is DJ Invoice, he looked like Wolfman Jack, the DJ in American Graffiti, and I wonder if he is as well expressed in the original language. > <br /> Two planets in the movie exploded, the explosions were unimpressive and seemed to owe a lot of inspiration to Star Wars, but to his credit the cause of the explosion was completely different from the main weapon of The Death Star The dialogue had a good and interesting explanation of the cause, many other explosions of the film looked good, but not the planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very tacky, as if they had been borrowed from a video game of the late 1970s. Some images look like primitive video games, and the influence of Tron is also visible. By cons, the sound effects are often quite decent, even if it highlights the parts to the sound of cheese. Art is good too, especially when it stays away from often ugly computer information. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is history. If a movie tells a good story, it can afford a lot of production problems. But the plot here was rather light. A naive boy tries to help someone aboard a crippled spaceship and gains a great power that he does not understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions fight against a powerful and irremediable enemy. He makes friends, discovers his special power and becomes a young man. If he is persistent enough and virtuous, he could even defeat the bad enemy. Details along the way can make such a story go beyond simple outlines, but there is very little in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a cartoon for kids. But then, as it seems that the main target audience is older children, perhaps it does not need to be more than that.
