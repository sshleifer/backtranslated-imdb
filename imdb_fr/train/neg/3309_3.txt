The plot, the development of the character and the gags in this film are extremely weak. A waste of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace is supposed to make the characters grow up during their struggles. No development of this type has been made possible to make possible such confused and warm feelings. Drug gags are clich√©s and much of the film does not sound true to life. The plot creates what is supposed to be a tension, but the characters are not developed enough to care. Resolving all outstanding issues takes about a minute on the screen, leaving the viewer feeling like he's wasting his time.
