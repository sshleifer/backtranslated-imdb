Do not you hate it when you order a steak but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> That's what I felt when I looked at what's called "Battlestar Galactica". Arguments can be made about its quality, but the fact remains, it's NOT what fans have ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you were sitting in this prestigious restaurant that I mentioned. You wait for years to bring back their famous New York Strip steak that you liked. When your meal arrives, you notice that they have applied the name "New York Strip" to a chicken dish. You complain, but the waiter is content to say "but ze cheeken, it's really GOOD zir"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted New York Strip - a STEAK! The waiter then explains: "You want the chef to want to do, as you zay, zomezing NEW We felt that the cheeks would be more popular, but we gave it the name of our previous delicious d√©esh". You're wondering if you'll ever find the original New York Strip on the menu, but be aware that, as the restaurant has a dish called "New York Strip" on the menu, you'll never see the original New York Strip - again time. <br /> <br /> This is the case of creating something NEW and slapping the name "Battlestar Galactica" on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series is an affront to all fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the production team responsible for this new version has obviously despised the original. BG's resurrection team should have liked the original series - it was trying to improve what fans loved but not to shamelessly sell this new series using the name Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> If SciFi Channel wanted to give us a new show, then do it! Give it a new name! Do not use the name we remember very well to try to attract viewers. This effectively deprives us of the chance to see any semblance of original in the future. <br /> <br /> We have been waiting for 25 years to see what we know as BG because we liked something about the original! We did not just want the NAME and the remnants of the basic concept. There are things we LOVE about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the BEST elements of the original were probably the ones that had been omitted. Of course, the original GT was flawed and could have used some updates. This mini-series, however, is by no means an improvement, but special effects (which are good but are not unusual under current standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will debate the quality of this film. NEW show but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> That said, I will make some comments on the merits of this new mini by itself (and not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were the best part. Efforts have obviously been made to make the effects "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at this effect". I would not say that these sequences were exceptional by today's standards, but they corresponded to the original films designed for cable television. What was the problem with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views have attempted to simulate the effect of a "real" camera with late tracking and jerky zooms. However, it was overexploited because there was no apparent SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely smarter series, Babylon 5, is the only case where I saw such "live cameras" being used effectively, when we were supposed to be watching an action by Security Cams. <br /> <br /> The script, you ask? The script seemed to have been written by a teenager, FOR other teens. The characters felt cardboard and stereotyped. Indeed, the whole story seemed to blend in with other well-known stereotypes. The only good elements of the whole story are the few elements of the original series that have been preserved. It was obvious that the digestion of your average audience on television was "absurd". <br /> <br /> Human interaction was pitiful. Rather than dramas based on subtle looks, meticulous expressions and timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious that it lost the ability to move a refined viewer. This was evident in any interaction between Adama and his son. The director has had to try to make sure that the most dense and insensitive viewer does not miss him, even if he is not paying attention. Sorry, but real humans do not behave like the others. <br /> <br /> I would not have considered this a bad show if she had been autonomous. Nothing good; he will never be worshiped by real SciFi fans or craftsmen, but he would be visible to the masses. Personally, I could have lived without that, however. I only looked at him to see how he really captured the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> This mini-series will always be remembered as a symbol of how the quality of narration has been set aside to appeal to more. How even SciFi Channel has "cushioned" its productions to meet the needs of the masses, unlike its real niche market, fans of Science Fiction. This will be the moment we asked for a steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you only one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
