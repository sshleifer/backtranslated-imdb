"Do not bother watching this movie" would be better advice, if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. It was a huge disappointment considering the mass distribution, not just of Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was nothing, certainly not the one described on the VHS box, of course. There was simply no suspense, precious little emotions and too many dark spots, most of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so messed up. It was not a good role for Monroe, although I did not need to see this character to know that she could play. "Some Like It Hot" alone was enough proof for me. But this role just did not suit him and it is not surprising that this is not one of his most popular films. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that a movie has lost the talent of comedians like Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not entertaining and entertaining is the name of the game.
