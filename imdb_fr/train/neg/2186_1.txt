... but you will wonder if we had it at the beginning! This film is as bad as the most horrible horror of today. A man wanders around semi-clothed ladies, trying to decide which one to kill in order to give a new body to his girlfriend. One scene depicts a man staggering and spilling on the board for three minutes, covering everything that must be well over ten gallons of "blood". The film also tries to give the impression that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is fake and unnatural, but the film is so badly done that it is impossible for the audience to create a sense of shock or indignation. This film can not even have its own title: the opening credits say "The brain that would not die", but the end credits describe it as "The head that did not die".
