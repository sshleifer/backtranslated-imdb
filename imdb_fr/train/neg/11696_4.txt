I started watching this movie with low expectations. In fact, I only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a novel S.K. (a novel I have never read). <br /> <br /> I'm happy that my expectations are low, because the film was not so good, but it manages to interest you. What really dragged this story is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is long, has no "nice" shots and no fright, the dialogues are stupid and the special effects are shit. <br /> <br /> The only good things are that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I guess the book has to be good) without using a lot of horror clich√©s. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10.
