The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you're a fan of Sonny Chiba, this movie gives you a lot. Chiba makes speeches; Chiba poses; Chiba chuckling; Chiba looks at the camera. Chiba hits the sushi alive and kicks them. Chiba sits on sofas and chairs and looks thoughtful / pensive; Chiba drives his car ... <br /> <br /> I love Chiba as an actor and martial artist ... but even for a Chiba fan, this movie may have a bit too much of Sonny Chiba . It is obviously a kind of vanity for him. And no, I would not put "Street Fighter" in the same category, because in "SF", he plays an amoral and ruthless anti-hero and shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and enemies. Here he plays almost all the time, and he tries to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat did not manage to talk about it during a feature film, and Sonny used his home a little. At least he could have changed his costume from time to time. <br /> <br /> The film is also ruined by a completely free and poorly made introduction sequence (apparently stuck to the front of the film for the first time). American version) and awkward bravery "(" Viva !! Chiba !! Viva !! Chiba !!) that starts things off the wrong foot. There is a surprisingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing - Sonny (or his usual English substitute) apparently could not be bothered to sing for the American version, so they had a bad dope with a totally different voice and dialect and softer is pretty shocking coming from the face we all know and love from "Street Fighter". <br /> <br /> Even with all of these flaws and overexposure, it might still be a minor classic, but the camera work and battle scenes are hopelessly tacky. I'm willing to believe that karate actually works if someone as amazing as Chiba's character is supposed to do, but the director and the cameraman have covered their bets by cutting and mounting fight scenes with a crazy weeds. spend most of the time. It's not all bad: there are decent images and compositions, and there is at least one memorable and nightmarish moment where the bad guys appear in the customer's room in a truly inventive way. <br /> <br /> And as for the real plot ... forget that. For a "bodyguard", Chiba's character is silly. The scenario depends on his mistakes and his omissions that place him (and his "client") in perilous situations so he can get by and, after 30 minutes, it is difficult, even the most credulous judgment is to think that this guy is supposed to be good. (Also, if his character really wanted to destroy the Japanese drug trade, he would have taken his client to his neck 10 minutes into the script and shook it until his teeth slammed like a castanet until it reveals its little secrets ... and a lot of useless deaths and conflicts would have been avoided.) <br /> <br /> However, on the whole, this film is very far from the bottom of the barrel. It's always Sonny Chiba, and it's always fun to watch. I paid the money to get this on a DVD rack at a local department store, and thought it was worth watching once.
