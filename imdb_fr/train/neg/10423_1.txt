so ... it's really sexist, and classist, and I thought maybe it was not at the beginning of the movie, like when stella told steven that she would really like to change and start talking about the good way and that he tells her not to change. Well, he certainly changed his tone, and it seems that other critics have followed suit. At first, what seems to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the film does not make her a hero, it makes everything sad. and it's sad that people think it makes her a hero. it may be the commentary of the film that people should remove. positive reception reflects ongoing patriarchal currents in social consciousness. yuck
