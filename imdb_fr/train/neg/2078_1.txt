I went to see this film yesterday and, although I did not expect much for this film, I was still bitterly disappointed! I really can not believe that I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was so bad !!! The scenario was shameful and the acting was terrible (although there were big names like Uma Thurman). This film relied heavily on its special effects ... but personally, they had no effect on me. Honestly, I wished that I never look at it and I strongly warn everyone against the projection of this film. This is a total waste of money and you will end up being disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, indulge yourself, but do not go see this movie ... You will live to regret it lol!
