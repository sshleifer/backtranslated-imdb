There is no way on earth that you care about these characters. A group of spoiled middle-class children take medicine at a party and get off to argue. I just saw this on TV and I did not think it was a "movie" as such, but rather a post-'This Life 'indulgence that really has no resonance or drama itself. Things like this will be ordered for time immemorial, unfortunately, middle-class lifestyle bullshit that does not get treated and takes itself far too seriously. There is David Baddiel in and this bird of "Cold Feet", you know what to expect. There was a lot of this stuff in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise ... "They are educated and drugged, friends, but a little dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships?" It sounds good! This kind of nonsense and comedy-gangster post-Guy Ritchie ... dark days. If you have taste, it will bother you to the point of violence.
