It's amazing that this film is finally in one of my lists of results. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only have I never been so bored (fortunately not for more than an hour and a half), teenage attempts with humor this feature, it's not even close to get but one of the corners of my mouth slightly inclined. After the first, very tricky part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. You hope in vain, it will only come down from there. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth telling and repeats this non-narrative three times. One can only hope that, miraculously, all the remaining copies of this film will be lost forever and Trent Harris will never put hands on the camera again ...
