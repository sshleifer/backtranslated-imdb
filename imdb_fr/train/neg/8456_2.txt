I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes, I was alone. <br /> <br /> I manage to stay until the end. It has been a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked Jean hugues anglade, but I think he needed to eat, like us, and so agreed to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters and the rest could be called "art" or something that I can not express, but that I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've seen is Crash, but I'm pretty sure now that I have enough experience to see it again. <br /> <br /> good luck !! ; o)
