While surfing the chains, we found this film with its promising synopsis. We were dismayed by the flat acting and the imaginary scenario. We have discovered fun scenes of cars, incredible shots and games that rain under the weight of tyro foam and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was to see all the recycled scenes of "Dante's Peak", where the church falls on the school bus, store windows stand off the main street, the collapse of overpass and the red truck rolling in the driveway. when the bricks fall on it. It was a funny, though unexpected, laugh, and left the audience wondering if it was not originally a low-budget parody of the disaster movies.
