First of all, I am not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema. Indeed, the usual success at the box office is to hit below the waistline. This film is not an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing advertisements imply. In my opinion, the only purpose of this film is to earn money by touching a sensitive morale (in fact, it is generally considered taboo in the country of origin). Cheap populism could provide a brief definition of what I meant. <br /> <However, the acting is almost perfect. In fact, most of the actors are of theatrical origin and try to compensate for what was missing in Altioklar. Talent! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the least experienced. (As Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation simply because he knows how to choose the distribution. Other than that, he is just a monkey of the media, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that only deals with nude / half-naked women. And just because the media boast, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and o something real artistic, I can not wait to applaud your next work. Hope this time, you manage to achieve an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In short; For> Play well, hot women (I'm kidding!) :) Disadvantages> Every thing, except the casting
