I went in this film hoping for the best. I like war musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their roles; However, the writers gave them a boring dialogue. The love-interest between them two has not been given real growth; Suddenly it was there. I did not think much about music; the best number was the excerpt we heard about Spike Jones with "The Face of Der Fuhrer". The only complete issue that Spike Jones did was little of his great musical; quite docile stuff, even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's humorous sketches were endless. <br /> <br /> There was fun: Lucille Ball was a spectator and there was a good selection of players who really deserved more time on the screen.
