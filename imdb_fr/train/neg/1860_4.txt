The 1998 Michael Keaton children's comedy of the same title was condemned for its poor quality special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George concocted for this horror comedy, it is absolutely staggering. The killer snowman seems to be made of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized kitchen gloves. What they were probably. The cast is based on this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as a city doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
