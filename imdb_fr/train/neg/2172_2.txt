Bottom of the barrel, unimaginable and almost unassailable remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows exactly the plot of the Filipino film STRYKER and is by far worse! Bad play, dialogue, effects, dubbing, stimulation, sequences of actions ... The list goes on and on. Italy literally did dozens of Road Warrior scams in the early 80s, some good, some bad. This is by far the worst, no contest. The mood of the film was not only completely dark and miserable, but being seated through it is boring. There was a good chase at the beginning of the film, as well as a cold shot of a man holding a grenade exploding. But everything about this movie stinks seriously! For your entertainment, search for a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER NEW YORK'S FALL, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX instead. They are much nicer than this garbage.
