I just finished reading a book about the work of Anita Loos and the picture of MacDonald in her angel costume from TCM Magazine was superb (awesome wings), so I thought about watching this movie. I had never heard of the film before, so I had no preconceived idea about it. I thought it was starting well, with Eddy as a playboy and MacDonald as a secretary he ignores, exists. The scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that do not stay is really endearing. I was even with the movie when Eddy fell asleep and imagined him as a real angel. But after a while it started to collapse for me. Eddy stays "asleep" for the rest of the movie, so everything is a dream. No matter what happens from that moment, it does not really matter, because it is only dreaming. The rest was rather conspiracy and useless. I had to force myself to stay with her. And the last issue where MacDonald went from musical number to musical number in a crazy hallucination was simply scary. <br /> <br /> Eddy had "woken up" earlier and the original story had continued or had he really married an angel, I think it would have been a lot more interesting. I wanted to see more of his real character. <br /> <br /> There were not really enough music numbers to call it a musical. The first songs were good, but the number of jitterbug played by MacDonald was like nails on a blackboard. Completely wrong for his operatic voice. Still, Eddy and MacDonald still shine, showing who their real stars are.
