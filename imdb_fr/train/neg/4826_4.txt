I see what the director was trying to do but he missed the target. The main actor was really good but the editing around his moments you out. The camera works, that is to say that the lighting and the exponent are a kind of amateur to which I could forgive if the direction was more fluid but it was not the case. The sound was a little awkward and it also makes you out of the movie. I see that I could see this director getting a little better in the future, so not quite right, but do not expect a dv movie as good as 28 days later. he. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yes, and apart from the main role, the acting was bad enough if you ask me. But I'm a movie buff then take that for what it's worth.
