This film was a long accumulation without a climax. People who refer to sword fighting in the end as a great must either be mad or have none. Too often, this movie has become soft. I'm not saying that soft films are bad. But no matter how much you like sugar, there should not be any space on a T-bone steak. This film was supposed to take revenge for crimes against a culture, but it ended up being a little fight. And there was only one of them who really knew what a sword is; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays it well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero", not knowing how to use a sword, and his "victory" was a shame. As a drama series, this film has its rules, but the best performance must be that of Scotland. It's a bit short of breath to be called "soap" in my book.
