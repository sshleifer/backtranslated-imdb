I just rented Creep and I was not impressed at all. I did not feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because the blood alone was shocking. <br /> <br /> I came out of my living room several times, desperate, that something happened with this movie. Have not we seen all this before? I did not like any of the characters except the guy in the cage. I felt bad for him. But again, I could not know why he was still alive and not murdered by Creep? You have to answer so many questions. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned the game references for PS2, Silent Hill, and I can see the similarities vaguely. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not a good one. Judge by yourself.
