Many people seemed to like the movie, so I feel bad about giving it a bad review. But after 96 minutes of sitting, I feel that I have to do it. Where the hell is the plot in this movie ?! I had to miss this, I was waiting for the scenario to unfold and nothing happened. Of course, the end was "a bit shocking" but they did not do it. I forgot who was who half of the time, so they did not really develop the characters. The game was really average, most of the time it was credible, but I could see through most of the time. So ... without revealing anything, I must say that if you do not like actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I just did not understand why there was so little or too much film. I can not decide which one, so I say judge for yourself. I do not even know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and everything ... <br /> <br /> Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 General: 3/10 I 'm I feel that it is too high, I stay with my vote at the top.
