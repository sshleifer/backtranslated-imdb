I do not know what they thought.by them, I mean anyone even remotely connected to this disaster.I have seen such bad movies, I have seen so many bad movies, and then there is that. but I will say no matter who the author, the script failed to put on the screen what could be the most insane dialogue. There is nothing good in this movie, either from a technical point of view, or from any other point of view.What it is permissible to do, then published should have been returned immediately. There are some pretty well known names in this movie. In fact, I hesitate to use the word movie.it, it is rather a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less sense. , I do not see why someone of dignity would appear in this.I got it really cheap, and I was still scammed.Even if I had this film for free, I would still be scammed. It's an absoluter 0/10
