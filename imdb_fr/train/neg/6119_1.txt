The muscular monkey in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team. the beautiful daughter of the team leader finds it first. The much disturbed version of Tarzan's tale has an OK production, but is paralyzed by the worst direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek is devoid of inspiration and has nothing to do with slow slow action scenes and a glimpse of his wife Bo Derek's naked body; behind the camera, he has about as much talent as Ed Wood. In search of ironic sexuality, the Dereks lack finesse, minutia and taste. They have the sense of self-parody and abandonment of bravery (they throw caution to the winds), but after a promising opening, everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who may have had balls in his mouth all the time) has the title role, but plays the third role with John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's sense of importance. * from ****
