This woman keeps talking throughout the film. She memorized each line and delivered them without natural emotion. She also has a very soft breath, and the tone of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. This film has MUCH too much Betsy Drake, and not enough of Cary Grant, who carried all that was left of the film entirely by himself.
