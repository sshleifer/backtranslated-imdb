The minute you give an "art movie" at 1/10, you have people claiming your blood ignorant, half ass-ed and artistically retarded. I will not try to justify why I am not an aesthetic retarder by listing all the "home-made art cinema" that I liked or mentioning how I gave to a "cult classic" "Unknown a 10/10. All I ask is that I be told the purpose, purpose and message of this film. <br /> <br /> Here's how I would summarize the film: Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends, describing almost absurd levels of impact. This intervention is followed by (in short, to save you 3 hours of pain), as follows: - A game show host dying of lung cancer is trying to fix things with his girl addicted to coke, whether or not he was raped was a child and is being courted by a police officer in ruins with relationship problems, while the TV game star decides he does not want to be a failed child prodigy, a the fate that hit another player in the 60s game show we see now is an unemployed homosexual, in love with a bartender and looking for money for a "corrective oral surgery", while the producer of the game show, himself dying of lung cancer, asks for reconciliation with the son he abandoned years ago and who later became a self-help guru, then same as the second wife of Mr. Producer suffers the guilt of cheating a dying man; and oh, finally, it's raining frogs (you read that right). And I spare you the incredibly long and useless monologues, literally disconcerting, that each character seems to invent on the fly with no other rhyme or reason than that of being able, eventually, to make sure that the film passes three hours and is classified in the category " modern epic ". . <br /> <br /> You probably think that I could have summed up the film better (and in your turn, do not confuse you) if I had written this damn thing in a more coherent way, maybe in a few sentences instead of one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
