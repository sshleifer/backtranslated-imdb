"Superchick" (1973) suggests nothing less than a long version of the movie "Love, American Style", a hit movie of the 1970s, "Superchick" is a piece of light duvet that always manages to entertain. And the main character here, Tara B. True, is really a kind of super chick. An air hostess (not stewardess) who is so beautiful that even the autopilot of her plane made her a pass (!), And with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this swinging winger really puts the "lai" in "stopover". With her handsome germaphobic surgeon in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her rock-star dude with creative challenges in LA, Tara never ceases to be busy. And when she does not dump these guys with all their virile energy, as the viewer will understand, she may follow a karate class, club tens of miles, fend off flashers and rapists, watch drinking parties AND stop a hijacking attempt. As I said, light fun and certainly good for a night where you feel a little brain dead and you just want to get out of the jar. The future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings a vague charm to her role as Tara and the film is beautiful enough to please. Disappointingly, Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples), the big favors of the 70s, are spoiled here in very small roles, but still have to do what they do best - show off their chesticules! Although the image is never funny aloud and does not have many metaphorical thoughts, it still manages to be fun, and I guess it's something. Strange that end credits draw attention to the double of Ms. Jillson's body, however; do not think I've seen it before!
