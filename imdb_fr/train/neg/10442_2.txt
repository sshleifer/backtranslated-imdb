Aside from the buzz on the internet, this movie was awful. I was expecting the movie to be a farce more than anything else. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror film and they completely missed it. There were only a few good games and some good lines from Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some badly animated snakes. All the jokes on the Internet were much better than the movie. Now that the movie is out, let's hope this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money on this trash can. If you're looking for something funny and fun, check out Snakes on a Blog.
