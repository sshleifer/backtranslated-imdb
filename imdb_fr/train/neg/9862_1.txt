I could not believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I was laughing because I play D & D half of my life. I had to turn it off because I had company and they wondered what shit I was watching. <br /> <br /> Finished later, and I should have abstained from the gay gay clown porn from the beginning. No, they cover the whole gamut of jokes about pets, sperm jokes, incest, racism, disguise themselves in KKK ... This movie is a horror for anyone who has ever played at D & D. <br /> <br /> No wonder he looks like this Real D & D would not let them use their game. Who would want their name attached to that?
