I'm a big fan of B-Rate horror movies and I've seen a lot of slasher photos. So I have a substantial gauge to judge this film. It easily ranks at the top tier of the worst horror movies of the 1980s. It's not as scary as Night of the Demons, it's not as bloody as Re-Animator and does not have the value Nothing Nothing Out There. That being said, this film has no value. Do not forget that the movie is a completely different movie. Still images on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this movie. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (There is a lot of violence but we've seen it before.) A murderer kills the students and occasional members of the establishment by cutting their throats and all the other tired killing methods used by horror movies). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: No <br /> <br /> on Francine Forbes - who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after filming this movie - who accepts a teaching job at a university. To be honest, it's impossible to worry, because the script does not specify any characters outside of Forbes). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (Terrible at all levels.) This slasher has the feel of a school production - high school, because the students could make a better movie than that. </ p> <p> Forbes presents a minimum of talent , just like Seminara as one of the students, but everyone is of the caliber of "extras").
