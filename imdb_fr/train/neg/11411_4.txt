The story has been reviewed several times. "a breath of life in the retirement home". Several plays, films, novels, short stories, poems, and news stories have beaten the subject, but it is still an excellent platform for the study of the character. <br /> <br /> If "Gideon" was designed with more enthusiasm, it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is completely inundated with clich√©s (even the subtitle and the summary Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost made me laugh at his ineffectiveness). Most often, the indifferent game is the drop that makes this weak film come out, but the rest is sufficiently bland so that the lack of concentration of the actors is almost useless.
