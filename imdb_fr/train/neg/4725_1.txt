An excellent opportunity for director Indy to make an interesting film about a rock musician about to become a star. It could have been a decent film if he had dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and the way he tortured his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon's. The hero of John Livien's mother suicida was John Lennon and she wanted him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on the musical genius of John Lennon and his wonderful ability to show himself so that others could learn something about their own lives, it showed that Lennon's legacy was that of a soul. confused and drug addict, who should rather be considered a man God. I'm a big fan of John Lennon and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's murderer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to remind him? John Lennon has given so much to the world with his music and honesty, and I have been repelled to see another person troubled, as the main character in this Lennon-obsessed film, and not to show his great contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory by making the Central Park Memorial to give his fans a chance to pay tribute to John. Instead, the director of this movie chose to use this site for the killer to attempt suicide. I found it disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died of a brutal and senseless death, and seeing such violence near this site was like another formidable injury for any Lennon fan. This completely ruined the film for me. It could have been a decent film, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace without his film being recalled to him by this evil murder.
