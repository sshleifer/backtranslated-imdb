Yeah, Madsen's character - while talking to the woman on the TV channel - is right: the LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist font. And this movie does not change anything about it. Ok, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even a black man, a Christian, a martyr. But it's a fairy tale, admit it. The reality is not like that. And most importantly for action fans: filming is boring. It's just shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, you will at least have something to do. The only moral of this film is this: the LAPD is good now. No more bad cops in there. If you like euphemistic and non-critical advertising for police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest advertisement I've ever seen. (2 points for the camera and editing).
