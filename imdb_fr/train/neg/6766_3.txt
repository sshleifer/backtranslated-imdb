You probably heard this sentence when it comes to this movie ?? "Herbie: completely stuffed with shit" and yes it's true. This film is really awful and totally lame. <br /> <br /> It must be Lindsey's second worst film since the confession of the young dramatic queen. The only good thing about this movie seems to be the cast of talented ones who are by far better than the movie millions of times and is the only selling point of the film. I do not see how an actor as respected as Matt Dillon could be part of this movie. Does not he read this horrible scenario before signing? <br /> <br /> What I did not like in this film is also why Herbie is surreal and fantastic as an extraordinary skill and climb the wall and go faster than a race car after all, it's just a Beatle. I know it's a children's movie, but they went too far with that and it turned out to be more silly than entertaining. It takes a bit of realism and the story is too predictable. <br /> <br /> Last words: unless the children are between 5 and 12 years old, I doubt that anyone can enjoy this senseless movie. What a waste of my money. I have the impression of being cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
