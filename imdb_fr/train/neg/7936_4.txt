Yet another film about a group of less intelligent people on a road trip that are moving away from their original travel itinerary for a shortcut or, in this case, to visit a dilapidated show attraction. The results, as expected, are not at all good, because this show presents a group of lunatic and incarnated residents who were escaped from prison before years ago. The father, who is apparently a professional photographer, simply has to stop and take pictures of the place, to find that he is still inhabited. The different members of the family move away to see the different attractions, but are afraid. The van tire, thinking that they managed to make their way on the road, explodes (surprise!), Leaving them to seek refuge and accommodation in the small town, which we discover is inhabited only by monsters (surprise!). <br /> This film goes as planned, the family being hunted down and killed by the monsters. There are retorts from the families, but these are probably some of the worst scenes in the film because they are poorly executed. There is nothing very original here, unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film. The acting is about as bad as I've seen it for a while now (it's pretty bad when your cast is overridden by the "Camp Blood" cast.) The special effects are void and the end made me want to play, punch my television. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, despite everything, I liked this film a bit, which definitely has an atmosphere "so bad, it's good "even pleasantly entertained once I've gone beyond the ridiculously cliched plot, the drama and the nerdy special effects. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can list countless movies that, if you have them seen, you've seen this before, the difference is that most of these movies are better, and although it's not a total waste, this movie is pretty bad and not really scary. <br /> <br /> My rating : D
