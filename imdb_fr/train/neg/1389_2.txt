I was very disappointed with this movie. Basically, he was weak, close to the idiot: souls that can affect reality the way they do it? A seemingly crucial mission for soul hunters entrusted to one of their youngest members? And the whole story of B with the "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the radio station was so horrible that I threw on television, "Why are you wasting my time with that?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, "River of Souls" does not go deeper into the soul issue than the original Soul Hunter episode. We see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not understand their culture. (Are there female soul hunters?) <br /> <br /> The acting was ok considering the material they had to work on and the special effects - notably the planet landscapes of the first act - were very impressive. But overall, I would say we must miss this one.
