A group of women who can not play are sitting, talking, smoking cannabis. They have another woman in a wheelchair that they hide because she's deformed and sometimes they kill someone to feed that person with human flesh that really looks like store-bought ham, which they dressed in. holding a few plastic fingers. We do not see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered with a bloody cloth. Because of that, I can not eat spam coverage anymore. Just think of a blanket of spam by a sheet to get the same narcoleptic fit obtained by trying to cross all this movie. There are sometimes scenes inserted at random of a guy who "chases" them by torturing a guy he has attached to a chair is his basement. Why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sit-On-The-Couch sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of a "superhuman" type panicking. He passes blood and hits through a wall, but what he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor related to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects. , no story. If you want to watch boring people talking deeply about anything by eating ham and smoking, then here's 90 minutes, because except for a scene where a chick hangs a corner and the foregoing. random scenes, absolutely nothing happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot to see them move, including the deformed sister, when they move into their new apartment. This is one of the few times they are not sitting on a couch or lying in bed.
