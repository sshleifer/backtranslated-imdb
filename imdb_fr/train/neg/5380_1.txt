At the time of writing this article, it appears that more than 50% of the voters in IMDb rated the film as 10 or 1. I can only assume that those who gave it a score of 10 were either actors or members of the team. <br /> <br /> They say that if they received enough monkeys, time and typewriters, these monkeys, by random gestures on the keyboard, would end up typing the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that, given the same number of monkeys and the same time, you could find one to give this film a score of 10. <br /> <br /> I patiently watched the first semester, assuming foolishly that the film would, at some level, develop the plot or the characters, or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke a barely intellectual thought. Otherwise, I was quite willing to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror, or even free sex, as a way to hold my attention. In the end, I was disappointed and, as a result, a good part of the second half was watched at double speed, while I searched in vain for an excerpt of film. Unfortunately, there was none. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" was opposed to an episode of Scooby Doo, I fear that the cartoon will win hands down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting abilities of the various cast members ranged from acceptable (at best) and embarrassing, with Brooke Bailey's portrayal of the weird and bizarre obsessed goth, London being so bad that I felt almost sorry for her. I would have liked to finish on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a second-rate punk rock feast, did not even entertain, let alone improve a very bad movie.
