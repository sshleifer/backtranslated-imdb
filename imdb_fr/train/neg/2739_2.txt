I do not know what it was shot at, but you can certainly say they did not have a budget. A bad interpretation, a horrible cinematography, a lame plot and decent special effects do not make a good movie. WWF-style cinematography will make you cry ... where is the tripod ?! The filmmakers were aiming high, but unfortunately missed their goal.
