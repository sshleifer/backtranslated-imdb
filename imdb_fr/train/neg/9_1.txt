It's one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. It tears up almost all types of thrillers and manages to ruin them all. <br /> <br /> There is not a single good line or a good character in all the mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought, and when it comes to acting, there's nothing good to say, so I'm not saying anything. Honestly, I can not understand how this type of nonsense is produced and actually published. Someone, somewhere, does not think at some point, "Oh my god, it's really a load of shit" and call it a day. His band like this has people who download illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you downloaded it, you did not waste your time or money. Do not waste your time, it's painful.
