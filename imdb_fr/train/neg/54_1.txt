The only good thing about this movie was Goldie Hawn's shot in her French bikini panties, which was struggling to stop a dozen depraved women from taking off her cotton jersey while she was laughing and cooing. Ooooof! Her kidneys compete with those of Nina Hartley. This film was released when I was fourteen and that shot almost killed me. I had forgotten all this in the naughty Roladex of my mind until I saw him the other day on television, where they scrambled his abdomen in this scene, my good sorrow, reminding me how much the woman hilarious smoked Goldie Hawn was in the 80s. Kurt Russell had to have a fun life.
