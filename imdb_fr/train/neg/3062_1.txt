Some would say something like "Baby Geniuses" with its giant baby robots or "Dumbo" with its psychedelic sequence of drug-thirsty nightmares would win the price of the most disturbing movie ever made for kids. You could say that too, but you would be wrong. And now, I bring you: Santa Claus, the most distraught family film that has been the worst since ... well, always. <br /> <br /> Since the first scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their tasteless themed songs (seriously, this segment lasts nearly 20 freakin 'long and has nothing to do with intrigue !) conclusion in which Merlin springs out of nowhere and saves the day (does not bother him, he is from Barcelona), it is the trauma of childhood at its best. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I ... just can not ... get ... those ... laughs ... to laugh ... of ... of .... .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste as a whale hungry for sex during the period of love. Nevertheless, if the inflamed homosexual demons with a severe case of excessive flu are something for you, I guess you should try. But really, this movie is not worth your time and your sanity.
