Years before this film was shot, Plummer was well established. Kinski had behind her masterpieces such as "Tess" and "Cat People" ... Must be desperate. <br /> <br /> The wicked have all the accents of wicked - * bad * accents of villain! (Plummer in particular, where did he learn to do "German"?) And most of them also have sneers. The innocent bystanders have panicked too much to make you laugh. The guy survives, among other things: * a 5 "throwing knife buried deep in his shoulder - removes him and a few seconds later, he uses his arm without any difficulty; * machine gun fire (I think someone one refers to a .50) in the leg he sorts by tying a bandage around the leg of his trousers and afterwards, he barely drinks *; several fist fights in which he undergoes several punches at the face and craning-first entry into a door frame *, a fall, back, of what looks like the third floor, on the pavement, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other derisory inconvenience. exactly 3 smart lines, the rest of The time is so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> OK, all is not bad.Plummer brings some class to his role and is undoubtedly the best actor of This film, of course, does not say anything. up, but he can do the ruthless villain without resorting to the ham techniques that most villains use here. shows his lines of type "Ve haff vays and meance" with some threat, but you always know that you watch Christopher Plummer play the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible time waster.
