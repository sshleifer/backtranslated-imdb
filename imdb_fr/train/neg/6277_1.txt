this movie really tries too hard. if you are going to make a horror movie, give it at least a reason to believe to hang the viewer. <br /> <br /> you wait and wait through the movie hoping for big explanations, but that's not the case. instead, he tries to be too intelligent and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> what was the purpose of the film? where is he really going? and more importantly, what the hell was going on. . . <br /> <br /> why were they there and how is it related to anything? just another horror of low science fiction. I love the fake critics on IMDb who say how great it is to publish related press releases to hit the film (or that people have low horizons). it's not worth your 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the film is better than the fragile film, but at least it has allowed you to reason and understand why things have happened and have a final result. this is not the case and you just have to carry tons of padding to make everything look scary. this film is about as low as when a foreigner calls. god who was lame too. <br /> <br /> great advice, if you want to make a horror, make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on, so that he has a hook for your story. Because if there is no reasoning or credibility, there is no firm grip and nothing can be scary. no disrespect for the actors or the team because they did a good job. it's just bad writing.
