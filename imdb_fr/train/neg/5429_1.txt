The film begins with a beautiful song It looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking in a suspicious way, but suddenly we are forced to do a comedy with stupid idiots routine like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like adult children Their scenes are quite amusing at first and then boring. There is an annoying plot of Tanushree's brother being killed. Towards the end, the film tries to become serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here he becomes still stupid. Then a long climax of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase in the house of Payal <br /> <br /> The film is so boring that you fall asleep <br /> <br /> The direction of Priyan is a very bad music (Pritam) is the routine except the first song <br /> <br /> The cinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene where he will pay his rent and I was happy that the actor is not too noisy like other movies, but no, It becomes as usual and becomes irritating most of the time Tusshar should not talk in a film, his dial is terrible. Sharman is the grace that saves, he is the only actor who plays very well in this film that Kunal Khemmu tries strong comic film as an adult, but does not impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan has less reach and is usual Payal is a non actress Murli Sharma is terrible
