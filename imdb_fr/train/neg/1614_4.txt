The second part of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary biography of Che Guevara discusses his latest campaign to export the Bolivian revolution. In order to keep his holy face of Che Soderbergh, he conveniently jumps to the mass executions he chaired after the Cuban revolution and the madness of his Congolese adventure ("It's the story of a failure", written -in the preface of his Congo Journal.) to fully focus on Che's attempt to mobilize his support to rise up against the government in Bolivia. This would prove to be a disaster and the last act of Guevara. <br /> <br /> What has bothered the first chapter fits together while Soderbergh slows down his film to explore the contemplative face of contemplative Guevara. like James Dean in Bernicio Del Toro's East of Eden. The problem is that Guevara has little success in converting and soon finds himself and his starving comrades engulfed in the darkness of the Bolivian jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent Aguirre, God's wrath Soderbergh does not use the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle to exacerbate the desperation of the guerrillas. He seems more preoccupied with keeping Che's nimbus above his head than with exploring the panic over the dead ends. There is a moment Herzogian where Che is sitting astride a stubborn horse who is kicking and screaming to get him moving, but on the whole, Soderbergh's staging remains flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In his two films, Soderbergh shows that he is clearly a groupie of Che and that, therefore, he remains at the center of his concerns. He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little to develop his relationship with key players in his saga, including Fidel Castro. To make matters worse, he does it with a slow, unbiased approach that never catches fire. One might think that he was sufficiently imbued with Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that radical change is much better emphasized with a radical style.
