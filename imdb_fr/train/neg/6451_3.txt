"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) gathers a high school group for a meeting in the booth where his twin brother Wes disappeared. While they are there, a man-like reptilian creature (who reminded me a lot of the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON Gillman) is waiting in the desert, choosing the right moment to separate them one by one. Kat (Chase Masterson), a motorcyclist like Ellen Ripley, owns an underground military bunker in which she practices experiments, while also serving as a place of safety to protect herself from the bloody. Kat knows more than she says (she also lost a child), but there is another twist of novelty that most members of the group do not know. This creature might be more human than they realize ... and its ancient identity could shed light on a deception that only another person has hidden since Wes' death. Kat holds the key to many mysteries that remain to be solved while the group stays close to the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, much of the film stays away from the creature that jumps through the air while watching blur screen when looking through his eyes. The film contains melodramatic Dawson's Creek type, which often prevents any real tension that needs to be incorporated into a little monster movie. Management is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of arousing alarms. The cast is rather lifeless and uninteresting. The pretty Maggie Grace (remake of THE FOG) could be the only draw for this movie.
