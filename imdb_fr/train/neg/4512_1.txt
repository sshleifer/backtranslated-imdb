Having lived in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even explain what a Geisha is. Unfortunately, we missed a good opportunity to bring Japanese culture closer to the Western public and to help demystify the country of origin of Zen, samurai, Kyoto's geisha world. Some of the most poignant moments of the film are those where Americans are presented in a Japanese environment. The dances of the geisha were not authentic. Chinese music was used far too much. A minor but essential detail: the proper use of incense sticks was not found. Sakura's scenes were almost darkly kitschy! Interestingly, some Chinese actors have been very convincing as Japanese.
