METAMORPHOSIS I'm going through the Chilling Classics 50 film collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the series. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS appears to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire", which also featured a scientist seeking similar results. In modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working to decipher the human genome to create a serum that would prevent aging. Under the pressure of the administration to publish his papers; and, to produce results (or risk losing money), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! Thinking at first that he had not experienced any undesirable side effects, he finally discovered that the serum had actually altered him in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The actors play is scalded; and, the performances left me with a very diminished interest in the film. The score is frantic. And the science behind the experiments and their discoveries is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous ?? the best. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the end turns into a thirty-minute gag, which is seemingly endless. Without saying too much, I'll call this one "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Black Lagoon creature and the isolated hearth."
