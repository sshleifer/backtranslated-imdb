This movie had potential, but what really makes it bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I had never seen it before in anything and there may be some Crouse fans who would like it in something else, but his performance in this film is bad. <br /> <br /> His delivery is robotic. When she pronounced her lines, it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines and was simply reading the list in her head. Thus, his voice has very little inflection. I can not believe that someone so bad has been given a lead role in a film. She must know someone in the business. <br /> <br /> Now, I hate to be so mean to her, but the commentary must be "too" long and her performance is what stands out most of all. <However, I liked where the story was going, so I kept looking at it. The first part of the script looks like a good movie. But the end was also disappointing. Maybe if she had been better, I would have liked.
