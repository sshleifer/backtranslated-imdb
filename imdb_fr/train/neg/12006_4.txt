OK the director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY The director Nikhil Advani after his debut with KHNH makes his second period and waits <br /> <br /> He makes a film of 3h30 + who loses patience, time.etc The spectator has 3 hours of sleep watching this movie <br /> <br /> OK, they had 6 floors so it was necessary but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Anil-Juhi convincing but boring, TV soap operas do not show such stories? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Govinda- Shannon who is funny and works well <br /> <br /> The story of Akshaye-Ayesha is once again credible, but it quickly becomes boring and l focus is on comedy more and more. worse, not just terms of interpretation, it does not make sense <br /> <br /> We have the story of Sohail-Isha to make you laugh and sometimes it's because of the boredom created by most other stories <br /> <br /> We have the story of John-Vidya a good story in all respects <br /> <br /> But at that moment, all stories come in fragments, the spectator gets bored and falls asleep. The highlight is not attractive Especially the highlight of the story of Salman-Priyanka Nikhil Advani is doing well in places, some stories are well managed, but weak in places. The music (SEL) is good, but too many songs The cinematography is nice, each story is told a different look, a texture and it works <br /> <br /> The actors Govinda rocking, after a return of dismissal with BB , he makes you laugh and love him in this film, despite his age and weight, Anil Kapoor plays his role well. he looks out of shape and John tired excels on his side, Akshaye Khanna exaggerates for a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too scathing and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissed > <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve a prize for this shocking film? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not only act, he speaks as if he were in his sleep and this dummy accent, oh my god, Priyanka exaggerates Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is fine Shannon is fine
