This is not nasty video, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were probably tired of it all in Britain. This is 75% of a rehash of The Boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason - no matter what it was. <br /> <br /> At first, I was confused because I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) could have been different Lacey, but her psychic view of a man with a boogeyman similar to that of the first movie was problematic . Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After witnessing a murder in a bathroom and see also the address, Annie, his psychiatrist and a para-psychology student who looks a lot like the guy on cheap novels and ads butter, head to the house and, of course, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later, a murder takes place exactly as she described it. Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered. <br /> <br /> Then, the film goes on a rehearsal of the movie The Boogeyman with some additional footage that we have not seen in the original. Notably, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes have been cut, but 90% of them are there. Why restart this film? Did they find the pictures in the trash? What was the goal? <br /> <br /> We'll never know and, even though the psychologist told Annie that she was cured, we all know that the ghost will never die.
