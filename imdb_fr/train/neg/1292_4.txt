Ok ... it's not the worst film I've ever seen, but I've heard a lot of good things about it and I was really disappointed. I could see where the filmmakers came from and they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were not very different from each other, that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting, etc. . . (Well, that's my presumption, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Anyway ... the movie bothered me. I watched a lot of very long movies, but this one just seemed to hang out again and again ... basically because I just could not bring myself to take care of the characters. I kept thinking .. who cares ??? I also found the actor play quite dead and the dialogue tense. I understand it was in the nineteenth century and all, but most conversations seemed rather unnatural. Nobody seemed to feel emotion in most of the film, except during melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "romance" in the story did not seem to be supported by anything other than "I'm a guy and you're a girl", which I do not really consider to be a romance, and yet I felt that I was led to believe that these people were in love. Oh well .. I guess it's all "all this horror around us, we have to hang on to" something like this, or something else. I was also hoping for a kind of dynamic between the two best friends (who initially seemed interested in the girl) but it was abandoned. Maybe avoid a love triangle cliche. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Oh well .. Daniel Holt was pretty much the only character I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I did not really hate Jake, but he looked a little too ... without a head, I guess. Jack Bull, I did not care at all. And I'm pretty sure you're * supposed to hate just about everybody, except for the poor, normal people who are sheared from side to side. It was rather graphic and there was this story of "the horrors of war", but I saw many other films on the same theme, better done. (I loved The Patriot, for example, even though it was a little manipulative emotional) But, as I said before, I'm cynical. What can I say? :)
