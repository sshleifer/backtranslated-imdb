I have never seen anything as horrible as this movie since long enough. The movie was boring, long and long terrible plot. The special effects are shit - it's like watching a movie in 1999. It's a total loss of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing at Lt.Speirs, he was not that bad. In fact not bad at all. But in this movie, his acting was not convincing enough, it was bad enough and there was no chemistry between the rest of the team either. Moreover, his eyes seem empty as if he did not feel it. This really surprised me because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> In any case, do not even bother watching this movie. It's a big waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, do something other than watch this movie. Believe me, you will regret it!
