I have never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of the awesome Hen Broon from the "Sunday Post" comic book page in Scotland.) In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laugh at him. I want to tell Chase that his best films - such as "Mighty Like a Moose" and "His Wooden Wedding" - have inspired a fandom that is fiercely faithful to him ... but I'm sure even most hardcore fans Chase will agree that very early and very roughly 'Married to Order' is just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - greedy, awkward, merciless, without anything - is a young swain hoping to make love to the beautiful Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this movie as his daring father, who disdains Chase as a "mollycoddle". Leo White, who did an outstanding job as a foil for Chaplin in Essanay, is here as a rival. <br /> <br /> Actions involving an Ingersoll watch are underway. I was intrigued by the fact that the brand is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one of the main flaws of 'Married to Order' is the casting of Rosemary Theby as Rose: she is supposed to be a classic broadcast venue, but Theby - the flat chest , hawk face - - is physically bad for the role. Theby (Harry Myers's wife) has had a successful career as a film actress, but has never been a credible place. The film historian William K Everson treated it with a lot of negligence in one of his films. <br /> <br /> I'm going to rate "Married to Order" to only 3 out of 10, and I'm a charity ... I still suspect that Charley Chase has something that everyone has, but I still miss it.
