Any film that starts with a cow doe can not promise much. Regarding the kibbutz stereotypes as they were 50 years ago, well, I was there and it just was not like that. OK, all the kibbutz only had a small piece of something shown in the movie (like young people invading the kitchen at night), but you can not show that the entire kibbutz is filled with all - shall we say - naughty features. Every kibbutz had its own problems, but practically no kibbutz had them all. Israel's views were great. I still remember my youth in this garden of Eden called Emek (valley). Yes, and the acting was good too, so you see that it was not all black - just a misrepresentation - probably on purpose too.
