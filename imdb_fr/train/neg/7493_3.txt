I could not believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly, the context of the Nuremberg trials becomes clear, step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but suddenly, in the last minutes of the first part of the series, the public can in see more Shocking and horrible images that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is important for people to see such images (although I strongly disagree with those who say there is no minimum age at which children can being exposed to this kind of material), but in this movie he was completely ridiculous. It was only to improve the impact of an ordinary television series. It was supposed to shock the public, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move us with well-prepared scenes, inspiring dialogues or interesting insights, the public is being tortured with horrific images of detainees in a skin-and-bone camp. This shows no respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
