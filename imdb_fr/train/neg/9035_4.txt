Being born in the 1960s, I grew up watching TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 70's and adored the scary movies that were regularly airing, including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "L ' Satan School for Girls "," Kolchak The Night Stalker ", etc., but this one is just silly. This is obviously the writer who tries to take advantage of the horrible murders committed by Manson a few years earlier. The film stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" famous as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family meets hippies who, for whatever reason, decide to terrorize the family. The reason is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist stance is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat them or something, do not sit there and moan. The acting is rather nil, the story is incredible, etc. Susan Dey is cute in a bikini, but that's about it. Ignore it if it is broadcast on television.
