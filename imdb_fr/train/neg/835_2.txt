After watching Lion King and Lion King II and taking full advantage of it. I thought Lion King 1.5 deserved to be watched. What a desappointment ! Disney must be desperate for revenue. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they have lost the agreement with pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they have just retrieved film clips that remained in the editor. floor (or a trash can) and stick them together to make a fast <br /> <br /> dollar. Unlike LK I & II, who both had a strong history. <br /> <br /> This film has almost no history. Although characters and animation are always fun to watch, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. Some of the pieces could have been good disk fillers on the original offers. <br /> <br /> Disney - You should be ashamed to put this trash can to make money fast! <br /> <br /> Next time take the time and effort and put our a sustainable job.
