After finally watching this film in its entirety, I am completely taken aback by the adoration he has received from critics and internet users. Is it the worst western ever? No, I would not say that. But "the last great American westerner", a phrase that I saw applies more than once? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A film that tries to tell a story like this needs credible characters who talk about a credible dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is one of the most ridiculous and clich√©d that I have never seen The film can be measured in grunts per minute; as in, how often is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There are so many examples of that that bothers. The cheesy lines come to you in the waves; predictable, non-original and often. <br /> <br /> If a bad dialogue does not bother you, why not make bad fights? Few Westerners can show that gunshots are totally incredible while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It does not matter if there is a comic side to this kind of shooting, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone, the very rigid and very stiff choreography of the beginning of the game is another reason to leave this film on the list good Westerners. The final confrontation redeems the director somewhat on this point, but at that moment, the film disinterested me so much that I could not save him. <br /> <br /> Apart from these defects, I can say that the visuals are stunning. the film is well shot and the settings are superb. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if you are looking for the latest great American western, do yourself a favor: rent instead Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
