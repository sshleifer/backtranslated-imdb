The author begins a "journey of discovery" of his "roots" in the Southern tobacco industry because he believes that the film (completely and rightly forgotten) "Bright Leaf" tells the story of a of his ancestors. This is not the case, and he does not actually discover any interest, even moderate, in this absolutely idiotic and complacent glorified home movie, suitable for projection at drunken family reunions (of the director), but certainly not for a commercial outlet - or even noncommercial. A good reminder of why most independent films are not taken up by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and of interest only to the director and his immediate entourage. To avoid at all costs!
