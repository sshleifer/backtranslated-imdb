This show is dull, lame, and basically tears all sorts of things to make it "original". First of all: the animation is so ugly ... Johnny is hideous ... and everyone is boring. The twins look like Dexter's teen Dexters, and Johnny looks almost like a smarter man, Dee Dee (also from Dexter's Lab). Second: The intrigues ... are terribly lame, which makes them hard to follow. The gags are tacky, and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little ... especially when he tries to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but these alone turned me off. <br /> <br /> Third: The entire song begins with extracting the melody of "American Idiot" from Green Day. And, although I'm not a big fan of this band, I find it really stupid that they accept the same overture melody and subtly modify it to make their own music. <br /> <br /> to the point ... it is a big big ugly trouble. 1/10
