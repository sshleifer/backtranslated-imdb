Tobe Hooper made good films, so I was sure it could not be bad. I did not read any reviews and I tried to watch this humorous film without wanting to. It made me laugh sometimes, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes almost CRY for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I noticed that 3/10 because his "horror" movie of 1990 and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the movie, I was thinking of something like "they just can not add other things in this movie ..." ... but they did it. <br /> <br /> Some say it's a kind of Firestarter clone but really 't. It's based on that idea but that's it. It's a combination of horror, comedy, strange things between religion and god, funny gore, simple effects, dramas, terrible actors, incredible storyline ... and more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * The story: The government is trying to create ultimate weapon using nuclear energy or something that does not work, the child was born to 2 people tested. When the mother sings for her child after birth, the husband and wife are burned and this is a SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. The government buries everything and lets this child live among other people and ... then, after x years, this kid is an adult and realizes that he was born for a reason and that he can burn things with his brain. So everything goes incredibly messy nothing really explains anything and .. Well when the government realizes "ok now it can put this fire in working order" they take it to the normal hospital where is a nuclear substance what they are going to use on this man BECAUSE they could kill him, no they can not shoot him no! .. and argh, I guess that's enough to say, I promise there are 100 other strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to laugh, look at this one. Gosh.
