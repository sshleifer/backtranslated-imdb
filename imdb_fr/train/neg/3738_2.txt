In any case, that's what the title should be. <br /> <br /> This film combines guns, explosives and blind killings to create the flop of an action movie. Let me make my point in a series of questions: deal type responses. <br /> <br /> What's going on in the film? People are dying. <br /> <br /> That's it? Yes. <br /> <br /> What's the plot about? What intrigue? <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of the film? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> How are the characters? Extremely flawed and contradictory to their own personalities. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good in this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras to film it. <br /> <br /> If you like murder and greed, watch the movie. If you are repelled by such an infrequent "entertainment," then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> In short, the plot stinks, the characters are not worth it, the scenario is completely resistant, and nothing goes together. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, directors and those who contributed to the making of this film are certainly not "facts".
