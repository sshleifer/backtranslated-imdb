WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see them all, The Hamiltons did provide a shabby entertainment, which he did not do. have fun at all !!!! I thought it was common to the semi-bad acting, the stupid plot, the plot, and the twist at the end of the film, which was very delayed, this film was bad! !!! Okay, so supposedly, these are people who eat other people.Yes ...... notice that I told people not to humans, not because they are not human, or to wait for me think they are, OH NO WAIT, they did not tell you !!!! So, okay, are these people cannibals, or are they imbr√©s, or what they are !!!! I mean, maybe they are just "THINGS" who came here to see what people are tasting or cannibals who have eaten So if you think The Hamiltons is good, I ask you why , why, why, WHY, WHY, why was he so great, because this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE? for me it was just horrible !!! A big BOOOOOOO for Go see The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail or Borderland for a show !!!!!
