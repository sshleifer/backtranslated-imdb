9, the movie I had been waiting for months ... was little more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the lack of history of 9 and by the strange development of his characters. All the awesome action sequences in the world do not compensate for a single unsympathetic character. <br /> <br /> The strange, almost thrown in occult sequences, was not only moved, but exasperating. The story is about robots and scientists ... Why does it suddenly turn into a wannabe of necronomic horror with mystical symbols and lines of green magic ghosts instead of giving answers to what might have been scary story devices? > How, what, when, why ... questions that only bode well if you care about it, and it becomes less and less likely that you do it as you move away from the theater. <br /> <br /> A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth .... I would watch this colored pencil movie if the story was good. But the filmmakers used the magic of CGI and Tim Burtons to attract the crowd. What ... is what attracted me but failed to earn my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been great ... with some extra rewrites and a little more respect from his own creators.
