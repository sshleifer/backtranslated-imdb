I must admit that I burst out laughing when I saw a critic comparing that to LOTR. Well yes, if you exclude the dwarves, the cast of thousands, the big special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the chic direction and all the rest. What leaves you with walking. And then, does this film work? If Mr. Piano succeeds, it would probably be three hours of uninterrupted hardcore stroll in the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so, those pesky Martians come up for a few seconds to stop him before he leaves for another walk. . You have never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really amounted to a budget of $ 20 million, most of that amount should have been Mr. Piano's shoe because he had to cross many pairs with all his walks. This explains why there is no more money for decent effects, a video camera or appropriate actors. Honestly, it's like watching a weird fetish video for people who like to go for long walks in period costumes. Even fast forward, it's a looonnnggg walk. <br /> <br /> As for science fiction, I think putting the Martians in the film was a mistake: they only hinder the march, which is clearly much more interesting for the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano charge to walk his dogs?
