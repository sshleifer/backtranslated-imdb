Maybe not, but it's awful. Even the fantastic cast can not save him. Okay, I admit that it started quite funny, but it seemed to tumble as soon as they jumped these girls in the house of generals. Bill Murray, who was a quick-witted and humorous man, became a bastard who shouted things that were not funny in the street, it was like he was trying too much to be funny. His character stole a weapon (a motorhome?) And ended up being a national hero after invading another country and killed God knows how many soldiers, to laugh. A good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US military and shows how arrogant and stupid they are, even unintentionally. In fact, I felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda shit could really be released.
