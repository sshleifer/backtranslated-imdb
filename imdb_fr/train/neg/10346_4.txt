One would think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter, this film would have been much better. Unfortunately, the film suffers hard-to-believe characters as well as a major conspiracy problem that gives some of the characters a fearless air. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the arrival of Ingrid Bergman within the Stoddard family. Everything is so fishing and swell - the family loves Bergman and things could not be more perfect. Until the mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market collapses in 1907 (destroying the fortune of the family) and Bergman is forced to return home to France. This part of the movie is a bit sticky, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after improving the family situation, Bergman is back. The four boys are now all grown up and there is no reason imaginable for rehoming her as a governess. But, briefly, everything is inflated again. But when the First World War occurs, all four go to war - that's it! In the middle of this, one of the sons (David) brings back his new wife (Susan Hayward). The character of Miss Hayward is as black and white as the others, although they are all good and puffy, she is obviously a horny devil. To make matters worse, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war. <br /> <br /> And here's where the movie gets really, really stupid - a stupid brain. Hayward begins an affair with one of David's brothers, but when the father sees a silhouette of lovers, Bergman enters the room by another entrance and claims that it is her, not Hayward with Jack! WHY?! Why would a sensible person do this to save the buttocks of a visibly malevolent and complicit woman? It was exactly the kind of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the gutter whistle once and for all! This is just a case of ugly writing and drove me crazy ... and probably did the same thing to the public in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a missed opportunity after a missed opportunity for Hayward the pain of being exposed. This goes against common sense and makes the film a silly melodramatic mess. As expected, however, the truth ends up being revealed and everyone is swollen again - happy to be a great and wonderful loving family, without the Hayward slut. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the fact that it writes badly. Hayward's case made no sense - at least in the way it was handled. And, having characters that are so fucking good or bad (with nothing in between) makes this movie a second-rate soap. The only thing that saves him at all is the acting game --- they tried the best they could with a turgid script. Suffice to say that the authors of Columbia Pictures who shot this film should have been hit with a dead chicken!
