The Tooth Fairy is talking about the ghost of an old, distorted witch who draws children home to get a price for their little tooth, then their life. The first minutes introduce you to the beginning of the legend of the Tooth Fairy in 1949, then switch to the present. The used horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid actor. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and some other scenes, but all in all, the bloody scenes were bloody but fast, which reduced the effect. The candy for the eyes is very good for both sexes. The work of the camera is good. The dialogue is fair but cheesy. I expected the film to be sparse, small budget, slasher with very few redeeming factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
