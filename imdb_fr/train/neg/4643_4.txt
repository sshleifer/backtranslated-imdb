I rented this film on DVD. I knew that the film would not live up to what he had promised me on the back of the case, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts rather well, the principle being that snuff films are broadcast by cable. However, the main character has nothing to make her feel sorry for her, and the end of the movie really lets you hang. There are far too many unanswered questions. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, but overall, it's a very mediocre movie, but I guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rent.
