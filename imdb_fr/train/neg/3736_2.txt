It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams has his place as a rhinoceros in a tutu, although his performance was still pitiful. Kurt Russell was more believable but was still awful. The plot left a lot to be desired and the rest of the game was so terrible. The only thing this film could have was the trailer, which made me lose 90 minutes of my life, which could have been better spent trying to lick my head. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and burn that movie if you have it. Otherwise, just do not be happy.
