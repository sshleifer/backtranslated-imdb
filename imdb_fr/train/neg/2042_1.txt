Zodiac killer. 1 in 10. Worse ever acting. Not really worse than acting. David Hess (The last house on the left ?. None of the seventies ?? "praise it is really good) is the worst of the group (a pretty fierce competition but it's incredibly horrible.) One would be hard-pressed to comfortable to find a movie participant at home with such clumsy camera presence. The movie actually stops on the screen when it is on the screen. <br /> <br /> The film has really no redeeming quality that Mr. Hess can ruin. It is filmed with a home theater camera and, at first glance, a very old complete camera with a micro-boom. No post-production either. Come on, there must be a shovel that a computer of five years can use to clean this image. Throw out weird archive images on autopsy and aircraft carrier takeoffs, and here's a visibly clogged image. The images of the autopsy are interjected in the same way that the Italian cannibal movies tell of these terrible animal murders. And the images of the Navy are supposed to be an anti-war statement (Because we know that all the bloodthirsty maniacs are joining the Navy) What is Lion's Gate doing in releasing this waste? That would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the zodiac killer (last seen in Dirty Harry?), Not the one from the seventies ??. Praise it's really good) Someone gets shot in the belly at LA and the cops assume that the Zodiac killer is back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder and where the relationship between the young murderer and the old man resembles that of a congressional page? a congressman locked up? The haircuts and production values ​​of the eighties respond to a secondary plot of Nambla. Sign me up.
