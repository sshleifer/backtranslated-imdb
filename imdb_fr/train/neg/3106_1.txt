Whenever I list the worst films I've ever seen, this movie is still showing. He has no redeeming quality whatsoever. It took an act of will to get through the whole affair and I would prefer to shed my own blood rather than having to sit down again. <br /> <br /> What's the problem with that? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see him at the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show on a Saturday night. The only ones in the theater were myself and a group of noisy, unruly and rather unruly teenagers sitting somewhere behind me. They were obviously having a good time on a Saturday night and had come to this "comedy" for some laughter. Before the movie began, during the previews they laughed, joked and made noisy comments. It was annoying limit; If they had continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the film itself, I might have said something, but I felt tolerant and empathic of their fiery pleasure, so I let it go. And they settled when the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this so-called "comedy" to the effect it has had on me, but also on this turbulent group. <br /> <br /> During the entire film, not a single person in the theater laughed. Not once. Not me, not the unruly kids. Absolute silence, outside the soundtrack. And when the film was finished and the lights were on, we all slowly left the theater in a slow, dark and absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> This is the effect that this "comedy" has produced. No laughing, no pleasure, but an absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing film, and not at all funny. Preachy, complacent, indulgent, depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I consider Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" on the list of the funniest movies of all time. I'm always absolutely amazed by the fact that this same man could be responsible for the least funny film ever recorded. <br /> <br /> In short: if you feel too happy, make a whirlwind in this film; otherwise, do not say that I did not warn you.
