I totally agree with the last speaker, maybe it's the worst movie of all time. I also had to move quickly in most of this movie. Michael Madsen had to make this movie a favor to someone. The quality of the image is grainy. And what a little plot there is, it's just stupid. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if I could score lower, I would like. Do not waste your time on this movie or you will regret it.
