One of the worst movies I have ever seen. How to define the "worst?" I would prefer that both eyes be torn off and that I have to tap, rather than look again at this pitiful nausea. One way or another, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a movie that shocks both Elvis fans, Mary Kay sellers, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and the rest of the world. humanity with the slightest intelligence, with a farce of bad quality, so forced that it deserves to be abandoned. How could Elvis Presley Enterprises allow the rights of real Elvis songs to be used in a film whose central premise seems to be "The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is a dead man" beyond me. The most difficult part of this mess - and it takes work - is the mutilated script: in 1958, the words and songs of Elvis he spoke / performed in the 1970s are quoted! Worst special effect? This Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis' tomb, potentially the most photographed / recognizable in the world, looked like a pyramid with a golden disk glued to the top and was somewhere in the middle of a park. Potentially, the widest audience of this movie would be Elvis fans. However, galloping stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, not the FBI's references ... and I could go on for a long time) actually belittles THIS conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. It's really a horrible film, horrible.
