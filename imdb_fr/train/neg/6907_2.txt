No clever writing here because it does not deserve it. Not an art film. Not even one of these "hidden" jewels. You know, like those movies you hear about through a friend who has seen this incredible movie in downtown where he shows all the good independent and artistic films. <br /> <br /> Just put it in the Christmas boxes and throw it away quickly.
