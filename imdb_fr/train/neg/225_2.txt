SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is fired by the girl Kate (Andie McDowell) because she mistakenly believes that Jed has an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends. Kate thought they caught them in the act. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, then sits in the middle of the road to put on his shoes. Then he gets crushed ("crushed", one of the meaning of the title) by a truck. And die. <br /> <br /> "And then he gets hit by a truck." Can you imagine a scriptwriter submitting a script with this plot element? Until then, it's a comedy that wants to be foamy, but has no real fizz. Everyone except Jed is just boring. And then they kill Jed, and everyone is sad, until the end, where girls learn to love each other and support each other, rather than destroy. I give him 2 pouah.
