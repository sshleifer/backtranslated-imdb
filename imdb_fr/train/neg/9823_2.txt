There is an interesting discussion in this film. Is a corporation good enough or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that without God's guidance, being a morally good person is not enough. At the beginning of the film, there is a sentence that says: "You and I can look at a morally good person, but both know that she will go to hell". <br /> <br /> Even though I'm not a Christian, the discussions about it throughout the film were fascinating, but not in the film's intentions. I left the movie feeling stronger than being morally good enough * enough *. The arguments and discussions presented were strongly biased to such an extent that they broke down under the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when it is inferred in the minds of the ignorant and the ignorant. As George Carlin's character in Dogma puts it: "Hang on while they are young". <br /> <br /> The basic principle is also very interesting. A biblical scholar of the 1890s attempts to publish a book saying that morality without God is acceptable, as long as morality makes sense. Do you just tell a child not to fly? Or do you tell him not to fly because God tells you not to do it? (Do not worry about telling the child not to fly, because, how would he feel if his marbles were stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle, wishes that his school's recommendation help sell the book (to spread the world). However, unanimous consent is required and one scholar opposes it. At the beginning of the film, he spoke in a very interesting discussion morality for moral reasons against the argument of the words of God. To prove his point, he creates a time machine (put in the film only to make the plot work, which suits me best) and sends Carlisle in 2002 to see where to teach morality without God will lead us. <BR /> <br /> As it should, he has his opinion and is modified by what he sees and has reversed at the time of his return (because he comes back, it's not really a spoiler, it's a movie bible after all). <br /> <br /> As for the film as a film itself, it is quite slow and very badly played. What was * not * necessary in this film is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to try to find out who Carlisle is, even if he did not hurt anyone, did not commit no crime. What's wrong in the movie just showing Carlisle's opinion, showing his vision of this "sinful world" and making it with a new point of view? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are some points in the film that tell me that I am happy not to be a Christian, or at least to say to someone "It's God or nothing" . Three at the end of the film bothered me ... first, when the two "bad guys" stuck Carlisle just before he jumped, Carlisle made his * unique * act truly despicable ... he simulated as if his jump in the time was imminent. Jesus, and that makes them the "bad guys" (who are also Christians, curiously), think they just missed the rapture. <br /> <br /> Second, after Carlisle's return, he finds a boy in which he scolded himself at the beginning of the film about not stealing (without mentioning God, the child kept the balls and ran away), and told him so. the time that flying is wrong because God commands it. Like Carlin's quote above, scare children and incite them to religion is a misstep in my book. <br /> <br /> And finally, the epilogue. Another tactic of fear. Carlisle asks the inventor how far they can go in the future, and he says he does not know .. the epilogue shows him trying to distort a Bible in the distant future (at 2100), and it fails .. it continues to decrement the years by 10, and trying again, and by the fade out, it is about 2030. Throughout the film, Carlise mentions that he felt come late of the world, because the world was prey to sin and the loss of the name of God. Alarmist tactics have been used for thousands of years. In the enlightened age, the church would also have lit up. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to have seen this movie. Although I am fairly certain before being morally good enough, I know it now for a fact. If you are not a Christian, tell him how happy you are not to be as ignorant as those in this film.
