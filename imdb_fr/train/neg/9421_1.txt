If you like to watch Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel, then you might like to watch Burt Reynolds in another film so bad that it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version, so the VHS version may be better, but the night and dark scenes were so bad that everything looks red. I first thought that my DVD players were messed up. It was not. If you insist on watching it, I recommend setting the color of your TV until it is black and white. If you do not do it, you will never be able to go through the movie. If you do, it will simply remind you that a poor film is trying to revisit the style of Pulp Fiction.
