It was a disappointing film for me. This came to me through a box called "Classic Black Film", a gift from someone who knows that I usually like movies of this style (I insist that black is a style, not a genre) . I do not think it's a black film at all. There seems to be a tendency nowadays to label and market every black and white B film made from 1947 to 1955 as black, and the label does not always match. Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), persecuted male protagonist, and most of the action of the film takes place inside. These are pretty much the only black elements I've seen. There is no ubiquitous paranoia or real reason to sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was too dressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to ruin this film for potential viewers. However, I would like to know what other movie connoisseurs have to say about it.
