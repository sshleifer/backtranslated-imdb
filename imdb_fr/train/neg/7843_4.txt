It is a weak continuation: it misses the interest and the lightness of the magnificent "Man Called Horse" in almost all the aspects and, compared to each other, they hardly seem to be of the same kind. <br /> <br /> The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke various Indian ceremonies, but seems too difficult to contain the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, after losing its country of origin, modern life has invaded paradise and they live in misery and poverty. This is perhaps the point to remember: the first film took us to a place where we would like to be, a simpler time. This brings us to the broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and the savior, which contradicts the idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first lies in the fact that the white man learned and discovered that the real civilization is based on values ​​rather than on Western materialism. In the second film, this is almost missing and we end up with a weak film. <br /> <br /> A huge disappointment.
