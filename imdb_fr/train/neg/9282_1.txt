This film is unworthy of the title of Omen. It's so bad that it really damaged the classic nature of the first three. It should never have been done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They do not even spell correctly the name of Damien Thorn !!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all Omen movies. Shoot it from the shelves and burn it.
