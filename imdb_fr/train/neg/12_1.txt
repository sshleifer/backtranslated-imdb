All I could think of watching this film was slop grade B. Many spoke of its redemptive quality, it is the way in which this film describes in a realistic way the effects of the drug and the individual and of their subsequent spiral into a state of perpetuation of unhappy events. Yet, in reality, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) have been overused and therefore unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, it was dull, unimaginative, improbable. and convoluted. You can read most of the other stories on this movie and they will say pretty much the same thing as me. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some of the actors and actresses are attractive, but faced with such a boring action ... wear a movie so far. The action is mediocre and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and an ultimate shootout towards the end. <br /> <br /> As others have already said, the movies "BAD" are interesting to watch because they are "bad", you enjoy it. This film, however, is a void. It's nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, if one really needs an educational film to deter people from using drugs, I would seriously recommend many other films addressing such issues in much more effective ways. "Requiem For A Dream", "Trainspotting", "Fear and Disgust in Las Vegas" and "Candy" are just a few examples. However, you should also watch some lighter movies on the same subject, such as "Go" (all in all, both serious and funny) and "Halfbaked". <br /> <br /> Finally, the one who will perhaps buy this film, delivered by Vinnie Jones, was stolen in 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To say that a little of this good movie was corrupted by 'Loaded' is vile. <br /> <br /> Overall, I strongly suggest you save money and time by NOT seeing this movie.
