I am a big fan of Porsche and the car was the best star of this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, the now dry star of drug addict children of the 80s is as sweet as usual, and comments the return of minor characters / actors would be useless; Needless to say, they were all very mean. It's a cool movie, like a journey back in the 80s - with strange clothes, good shots from the backdrop of Colorado, and a very harmless but mind-boggling plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, please, do not take it Do not waste your time watching this unless you like the movies of the 80s, Corey Haim or, like me, the old Porsche (it looks great) because life is too short to watch poor quality movies.
