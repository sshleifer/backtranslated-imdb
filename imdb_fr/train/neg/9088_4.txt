It has been said many times - especially by me - that watching a film by Eric Rohmer is like watching your painting dry. it seems that Mr Rohmer is upset about it (he does not deny it, but then how could he, he wants it only) so that his new film, which could also be his last, Inch Allah, takes place so far in the time it's like watching the cure dryness. The great people who gave you the New Wave, the Cahiers du Cin√©ma have already named it one of the best films of 2007, so that should give you an idea. Reality is not a priority of Rohmer, so that in the 5th century in France, we have at the limit a castle that would not be moved in the Loire Valley, while the only other home we see is a rough wooden hut. The story portrays nymphs and shepherds and, as he often does, Rohmer threw him with strangers who followed one another. The overall effect is that the annual class room of a special needs school was filmed by accident. One is almost tempted to say: "Come back Godard, all is forgiven", but even this lamentable production can not make me say these words.
