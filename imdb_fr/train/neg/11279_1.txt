Words can not really describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least there were some nice pictures and a good moment caressing the chin here and there to keep you from falling asleep. It's just laughable! Terrible scenario, mediocre direction, terrible game and you know what? I can not think of one thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it is not too long. If you want to have fun for 100 minutes, go to the dentist and go for a root canal treatment - much nicer and better value (provided you need it!). Incidentally, I have to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. IT'S TERRIBLE!
