I knew that this movie was supposed to be so bad that it was funny, so I started waiting with that expectation. I just thought it was so bad it was boring. The whimsical theme song is fun for about 10 seconds, until you realize it's smart, apart from its intentionally irritating quality. See things splashed with tomatoes ages in about 30 seconds. There is nothing clever or funny in the film, except for the principle. It could possibly contain a comedy sketch of 3-4 minutes, but it's just not a feature film.
