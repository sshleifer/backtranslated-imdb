. . . And that's a bad thing, because at least if it was a Troma movie, there would have been gratuitous violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandonment, which could have improved my rating a bit. <br /> <br /> Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) -wannabe with almost flat humor, little else we have instead is a very tame (PG), barely lukewarm, and low budget (Roger Corman produced it with a director unknown to the logic that made Gremlins work so well - fantasy logic or not, no suspense, no adventure, no violence or nudity to compensate. <br /> < The problems with the movie are inherent to the storyline - let's face it, no one could deliver these jokes to make them fun - it seems that the biggest blame must fall on the director's lap, Bettina Hirsch. could have been more entertaining in his hands. <br /> <br /> After all, it starts like so many great adventure movies, Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru for Simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist theories about the links between ancient sites and extraterrestrial civilizations. For example, he thinks he sees traces of laser cutting on old stone. They are therefore in Machu Picchu looking for additional evidence of Simon's theories when they occur in a secret chamber. Inside, they quickly find the animal they later call "Arnold", one of the titular eaters. <br /> <br /> They take Arnold home to their small town in the California desert. Simon, who thinks Arnold is probably an alien creature, must attend a colleague's conference and he plans to tell him that he finally has an alien specimen. Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left on Arnold's charge, but since they have not seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unattended as they jump into the bag. > <br /> Meanwhile, Simon's brother, Cecil (also played by Korman in a dual role), owner of a successful snack business, wants to buy Simon's house and land - they are adjacent to his. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil decides to steal Arnold. Things get progressively out of control, and snack foods, which have a poor average to match their cravings for junk food, are starting to invade the city. <br /> <br /> This is better read in a summary than it plays. the screen. The best shots of the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, as when characters drive to the outskirts of the desert city. The interiors, with the exception of Cecil's house, tend to look like poorly decorated and cheap decorations, and more importantly, they tend to show that Hirsch is not very good at blocking and setting up plans. Oddly enough, given the scarcity of production design, Cecil's house is a real gem, imbued with the frightening style of the 1980s down to the smallest detail, and Cecil's son-in-law, Dude (Jon Stafford), was funny counterpoint. Too bad, therefore, that it came out so quickly from the film. <br /> <br /> In any case, Korman is a fun actor, but he seems much better here as Simon than in Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up being absent for most of the film. Cecil, who is physically distinguished by a ridiculous wig and ridiculous hairs, is not only the "evil capitalist" of the film, but he is one of Korman's inconsiderate and rude classics - it's one of his specialties , often capitalized in "Carol Burnett Show" (1967) sketches. Unlike "The Carol Burnett Show", which had a tendency to succeed because filmmakers Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a well-thought-out method of pushing skits to the brink of chaos, Hirsch directs Korman too far, and Cecil's character does not. Do not Work as it should. <br /> <br /> There are many other issues related to the director, including the insignificant rhythm and editing, which completely undermine any suspense or dramatic and convincing impact of the film. Even the scenes that should have been rented to give a boost to the drama, such as when snacking harass an old lady on the road, are far too clumsy to have any significant effect. <br /> <br /> History as it stands also poses serious logical problems. Where did the munchie in the room at Machu Picchu come from? The movie trailer seems to indicate an answer to this question, but it was modified at the end of the editing. A more serious problem is that, unlike Gremlins, there is no clear reason for cravings to pass cute and cuddly hair balls to threatening monsters. It just happens. Moreover, since Munchies has been kept PG and the violence remains muted, when the creatures are in their monster phase, they are never very threatening. They are also easily shipped, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> Of course, most of the film is not suspense, horror, drama or anything, but humor. It's more like a parody of Gremlins and the countless scams that ensue. The only problem with this is that the movie is just not funny, although I laughed a few times. A surprisingly high percentage of jokes are bland pictures. Too much of the remaining material consists of non-sequencers. Given the bad timing of Hirsch, everything falls flat. It was possible to make a film that, while fictitious, was both funny and frightening, hilarious and disturbing, corny and suspenseful, all at once, like Ala Killer Klowns by Outer Space (1988). Too bad, then, that Munchies is far from that.
