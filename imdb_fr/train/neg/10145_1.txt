Steven Seagal seems to be wandering through a horrific film shot almost entirely in close-up to hide the total lack of budget and resources. Taking into account the technical flaws - the silver F / A-18s and F-14s take off from a carrier for an air strike and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this film more credibility than he does not deserve. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing about the movie is the generic titles that disappear in a flash, which are likely available to all Final Cut Pro users. Put all your creativity to your credit, place Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
