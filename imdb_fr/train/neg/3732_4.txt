Maybe because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen it since I was in Grade 7 in a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression ... and most of my friends. He served his purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly terrified by what Christians converted after the rapture suffered when they did not receive the mark of the beast. I do not want to ruin the film for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention the details of the scenes, but I can still imagine them in my head ... and it's been 19 years.
