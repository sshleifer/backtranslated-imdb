Wolfe's original novel - in fact, the goal of the whole story - is that things happen for a carefully calculated sense of opportunity. The goal is survival in a particular lifestyle. The novel is full of mischief. The only relationship that sounds emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that only touched him. Apart from that, everyone is looking for what they can do with advertising, power, money or self-aggrandizement. <br /> <br /> Wolfe has been criticized for hitting all the characters and social strata of New York City. . His answer was a denial. After all, he lived in New York himself and belonged to a neighborhood promotion committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications he would need on his resume to deny that he hated New Yorkers. (Wolfe holds a Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale and is not a model.) It is these supposed weaknesses that made the novel memorable. Nobody was good. And Sherman McCoy went bankrupt, a professional protester for social justice. The film rejects all this and imposes on history a moral framework that simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Each event was not only possible but perfectly credible. Wolfe might have been a great cultural anthropologist: he knows how to enter a system and record the details. <br /> <br /> Yes, one of us could have found ourselves, like Sherman and his mistress, stuck in the South Bronx, threatened by two black kids, and escaping after colliding with one of them. This scene is perfectly transferred from printing to celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after this scene, the film no longer seems to trust his audience and sometimes becomes frenetic in his attempts to spell his message, as nebulous as it is. <br /> <br /> Sherman could accidentally hit a child and be arrested for it, as he is in the novel, but he would not return immediately after he was released from his incredibly expensive condo, would fire a shotgun, and starts shooting in the ceiling with, as it does in the movee. In what is supposed to be a fun scene, plaster on the ceiling falls on all the guests of the party and they scream. It just would not have happened. The film left the undeniably detailed reality of the novel in the dust. Wolfe's sensitivity, the work he did to capture the real, was lost. Instead, we get a noisy, fantastic and stupid scene that does nothing but wake up the audience. Similar empty scenes ensue, shouting at Wolfe's verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> The film also fails because it introduces much sin and redemption into an amusing story of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in Hell" at the opera. We receive lectures on the redemption of a poet with AID. We see a lot of guilt at Sherman. A black judge who preaches at the hearing and delivers one of the last speeches about how we all have to behave ourselves. A journalist who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman gets away by breaking the law with a silly smile. The scene rests on the film as a jester cap on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film presents not only trivial and non-original points, it overestimates them, as if the audience was unable to absorb the subtleties. <br /> <br /> It's not the actors' game direction that is poor. The film is not bad in these respects. And the photography is pretty good too, including two pretty spectacular shots - the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. This is the script that is completely botched. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is about satisfactory, both in design and execution. He keeps some of the little details of the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is called Marshall. Who the hell would name a Marshall dog? He almost completely lost his attention in the second half and, overall, was hardly worth watching. <br /> <br /> Wolfe's cynical right wing may be offensive to a lot of people, but he has the cajones to drop his percepts out. Alas, the writers and producers did not have the courage to take them and thus missed the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers.
