The plot is so manipulative, totally relying on the most incredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each parental decision. The kids are great with regards to the charm and delivery of the lines, but as I said, the whole plot depends on that every adult is a complete idiot, and therefore, in this case, more sense of his actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the acts of total mistrust of boys). Why would charming little boys have taken a baby from the shore? How did the baby get to the shore and at the same time did he explain that this was the LAST place to research? Why the boys would they NEVER informed and instead that even if a baby is gone, nobody told them to run with food and diapers with all the excitement and literally wherever he searched? There is no possible justification for asking the public to believe it. Asking to believe that this would be the subject of a trial (even in an informal setting) is too insulting to be stripped.
