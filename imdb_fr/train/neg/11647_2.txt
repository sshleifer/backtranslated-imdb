BOSS CRIME is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian police series partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. A film easily forgotten. Even in spite of a good car chase sequence, this movie seems to work almost aimlessly. A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. Unwritten laws and mafia code ethics make it difficult to trust anyone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence produce the same result. This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics. Just the look of the movie recalls the price of the American drive-in. Even the popular American actress Telly Savalas can not improve the caliber of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also plays with: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
