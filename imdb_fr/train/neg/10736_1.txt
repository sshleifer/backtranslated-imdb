The film starts off enough with an intriguing scene, three people drink and chat in a bar. All invent stories a little scandalous. As the film unfolds, it turns out that the most outrageous story is true. However, beyond that, the film is not very interesting, except for the stage in the bar and the stage where the main secret is revealed. This revelation barely occurs half-time in the film and frankly, there is not much left to see. The rest of the time, the director lingers in a Russian village abandoned by god and peopled by pitiful old ladies. Of course, these are fascinating and somewhat shocking pictures, but admiring them goes on too long, sacrificing any plot or character development possible. I found this film as another example of ugly or lazy shooting, where instead of trying to make an interesting story, filmmakers focus on strangely fascinating images and in a few unrelated stories (example: story a meat trader) to let the viewer understand all the nonsense. On a surface, it has an artistic appearance, but in this particular case is only the lack of talent.
