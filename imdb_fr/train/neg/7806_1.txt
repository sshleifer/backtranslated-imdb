Poor Michael Madsen; he has to kick himself to know that people have learned about this horrible movie. I really can not think of anything worse than I've ever seen, except amateur porn. It's so bad, and everything here; wooden role play, bad scenario, crappy moral end, you hate it and it's in this movie. <br /> <br /> My question is: "Who the hell has put $$$ in this piece of doggy doo?" Could have seen Michael's sister, Virginia, naked in a scene, but I do not think that even that would save that fool ... <br /> <br /> For a cool guy who made some great movies, I want to know what crazy church sponsored this piece of crapola.
