If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. The Omega man comes to mind. At the studio's merit, they avoided the sprawling, useless, big-budget technofest that characterizes movies like this. In addition, the facilities and facilities were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to move away from an infectious and fatal fatal disease. What is wrong is ALL the rest! I'm tired of endless, stupid, careless, weak, ineffective and arrogant characters in a movie. That describes just about everyone in the movie at one point. I rented it and I found myself screaming on TV several times: "No, do not do this!", "Why are you so stupid", "Watch out!", Etc. A real lack of character development is evident at about halfway point. A movie SHOULD give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you are really interested in what happens to them. This one does not do it. In addition, the end of the film should have been longer and longer.
