Here is one that you can look at with an impassive face, with a scenario so bad that even Will Ferrell would not be there. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. The punch-dance. Rod "needs to go to his quiet corner" and before anyone can tell Kevin Bacon, he is losing his passionate and overworked temper under the tunes of a group who would like to have the faux metal chops at long hair of Europe. <Br /> <br /> 2. You are the voice of John Farnham. In one of those epic sequences where the star and his teammates follow The Slomo Walk in Main Street and the townspeople follow on their heels, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the filmmakers even meet this Australian performer? A major Australian singer (and a real talent) who became known in the early 70's for Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, the John Farnham's hymn is so bewitching, he has shaved mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two highlights in the film - both ruined in any case by a neglected writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit. <br /> <Andy Samberg is Rod, a stunt rider who has never jumped. This may have something to do with driving a moped in the dark. Or his fake mustache. Yeh, someone really found that funny. <br /> <br /> Without a jump under the starry mantle, he anticipates an extravagance of 15 buses - which would surely kill a comedian of lesser bad mood, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously eliminate cancer and no matter ... who's watching these movies for conspiracy anyway? Along the way (as usual for stupid heads in these comedies), he marks a healthy chick (Isla Fisher), which must surely be delayed to consider the exchange of chromosomes with this loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost phoned for her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
