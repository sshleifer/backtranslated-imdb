(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about the heroic women of German Nazism. But it is much too long, it is not touching and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good acting. <br /> <br /> The narration is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers the events of her life. Okay, now we have a point of view. Then there is another woman presented who does the same thing. What is confusing is that they both remember events experienced by other people! Come on! It's a lack of knowledge of basic storytelling ... How can Riemann know the fate of the girl's mother and her interrogation, for example? <br /> <br /> The scenes are presented in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, the scene where Riemann proposes to Fabian. When did it happen? The scene seems to unfold in the 20s ... <br /> <br /> The character of Riemann is of course a talented pianist, and even a baroness! Sensational. His brother comes back from the eastern front, he received a "Ritterkreuz" that he shows in certain scenes. So, he is a war hero and remains a good man who has preserved his conscience. And he became aware of the massacres committed by the Germans. He even made pictures! And it's true, cliche after cliche stacks and that's why the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically, Von Trotta made a film for a film that could have been decent. And in the end, everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way to put Goebbels in bed and - da! - everyone is free. This is not a historical fact, but a pure imagination despite the so-called "true story" of the beginning. Like "Sass", it is vaguely based on a real event. <br /> <br /> It's sad but true, it's the typical German film nowadays. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
