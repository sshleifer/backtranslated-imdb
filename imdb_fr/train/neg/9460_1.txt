This film upset me! When I think of Cat in the hat. I think of the cat in the notebooks. You know, a few years ago that parents read to their children. Well, I thought this movie would look a lot like that! But to my surprise, nothing looked like books! Insted, it looks more like a comedy movie for young adults In a party, a cat talks to a gardening tool (hoe), a cat talks to him as if it were his hoe (agin adult humor). the name of his car, it was a little bit tempting for a children's movie. under the note you will find: sweet cude humor and some double-meaning. I think that means in short adult humor. I wish I could return this film! Wal-Mart said they would not do it because the movie was open. If you are thinking of buying this, I suggest that you maybe rent before you buy.
