This film is not interesting, except for the first ten minutes. Rhythm and editing are a perfect introduction to a set piece, even better than Gosford Park. Then he slows inexplicably, loses interest and begins to look like a traditional French film to finally find it with the love relationship between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle, there is too much margin and tips in the story, several open discussions are not ended. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ******* AHEAD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. He was faithful to her after her relationship with her many years ago, despite her remarriage and her establishment in Morocco. As a builder, he now rebuilds his own life and recovers his own by taking the mask of Cecile's wedding. Having accomplished this, he is buried (literally) as a result of an abnormal accident and becomes comatose. He only wakes up after having burned their old picture, a sign that they have reconciled with the past and that they can resume their lives together. ******* END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> It is not clear what vision this director wants to see us because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are many radio broadcasts on the overthrow of the former Iraqi regime. Cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by a dog (fidelity) as soon as he meets his boyfriend, while the girl with whom he lives seems to be sick (of that?). His sister is traditional Islamic and has a relationship with Cécile's husband. This depicts Morocco as a useless delay, despite all the building, a strange colonial vision that almost glorifies the past. He describes Islam as backward and extremist, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end, this can be described as adding local color and art to art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material, they are so familiar that they are able to play an additional role in every scene: raising an eyebrow, body language, radiant pride, awkward behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of French cinema in today's world. With some notable exceptions of course.
