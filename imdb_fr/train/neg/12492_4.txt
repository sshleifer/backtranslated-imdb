This is one of their movies that has an awesome video box but has some camera wire and unknown actors who are talking with a bad dialogue. It's so dark when the murders happen that you can barely see it and that the movie is hard to understand. The only star is Vanessa Sanchez of the WCW (Tygres at WCW before she goes to bed) and she is a good actress. I like low-budget movies, especially those with errors because they are fun to watch, but they are not cut. This film is acceptable to see if you like voodoo and sliced ​​heads, but it's not a blockbuster, but if you need something new to look at and then rent Severed.
