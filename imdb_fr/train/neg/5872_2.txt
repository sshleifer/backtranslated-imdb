I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking they were police mates. They are but Busey is in the opening scene and then reappears only 40 minutes after the beginning of the movie. Although every scene he's in is great. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> The plot is amazing in this movie. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who stalks and kills sex phone operators. At one point, I think it's his Busey. But it turns out that I'm only partially right. Busey is not the murderer, but he calls and harasses women by phone. Why? I do not know. In no way is he connected to the killer, he just does it for kicks, I suppose.
