I decided to watch this one because he was nominated for an Oscar this year. Like many people here, I guess, I really wanted to love this movie, but I was bored and disappointed. The first scene was OK, but all the rest of the film in camera mode "shaking hands" is really boring. <br /> <br /> I guess the main reason for making such a movie and naming it for Oscar is: <br /> <br /> The American "military machine" (people who earn money on war) urgently needs an excuse or justification for the war in Iraq by yawning something (somehow) patriotic. <br /> <br /> The "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of ​​"love war like a drug"? .. Oh, please, go! How boring! <br /> <br /> look at this to get an idea of ​​the decline of the film academy ...
