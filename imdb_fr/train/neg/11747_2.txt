Although the press was supportive after playing at Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much of that. One - it's a Canadian film with a very small budget. Two - it's written, directed and performed by the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it's Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But despite the fact that I look at it with lower expectations, the disappointment turned out to be much greater than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> In a word - bad scenario, bad acting, terrible staging! Do not waste your time and money with this turkey. He claims to be a comedy, but I only laugh twice. In addition, there is a terrible music that sounds. How that attracted attention, I'll never know.
