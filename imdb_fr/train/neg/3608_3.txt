I have a nice collection of movies in progress, and this one has been added. Number 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> The title made me leave at the beginning. Splatter University. I thought it would be a great horror movie. Was I already wrong? Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it could have been much better. I love all the movies, but this one was funnier than scary. <br /> <br /> Poor audio quality, poor quality of action and poor organization of shots are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is ideal for a good laugh. If you're looking to make fun of one of these movies, then this one is one!
