I do not often give notice to a star, but the computer will not let me make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The first titles tell us that we are already in deep water. Although it is a low-budget film, 17 producers are credited. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, the abusive husband Kenneth returns home to his family, in a gated and upscale community. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), let the kids have fun all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 when the movie was released. Uh, are they his children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della goes to the mall, a long scene that could have been cut. To stave off the idea of ​​the eeeeeeevil male aggression that rages in the universe, it passes before football players in uniform and plays in the pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Sure. For a bonus, she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer attached to it. <br /> <br /> However, we have a bit of suspense in the driving scenes. It's raining and the traffic is bad. We first see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then later, Della tries to drive and talk at the same time on her mobile phone, turning around completely to check the cluttered back seat of the phone charger. <br /> <br /> She wanders in the mall, sees an old college friend trying to buy things but her credit card is refused - that's it, maybe her husband is cranky because it goes bankrupt, but it's too complicated for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> On the parking lot She often runs up against the most ridiculous gang in the history of cinema. A white boy (Lukas Hass looking at his career going to the bathroom), a black, an Asian and a Hispanic. Imagine a company of Up with People that has failed and you will get the idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a rifle, she gives them the attitude. A policeman from the mall comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head, shooting several times. The parking is congested as it can be, people everywhere and no one notices it. Della escapes into her car and instead of choosing a police station or a well-lit security zone, she goes to a construction site, where she kills the four bad guys one at a time with the tools (literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> The MAJOR fin is in front of her. <br /> <br /> She goes home. The car collapses so she crosses the driving rain. Check the kids down, and when her husband asks what happened to him at the mall, he shows him the gun and shoots him at close range. <br /> <br /> The experience of the four punks was supposed to lead to personal empowerment for Della. Instead, we know that her children will likely spend Christmas in foster care or in a group home, as the state will recover them while she responds to a murder charge. The four punks can be classified as lawful homicides in self-defense. The husband, different story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw this on a cable. If I had seen him in a theater (was there an exit?) I would have been furious. As things stand, I'm just sad to see talent like Ms. Basinger's and Mr. Haas's wasting on such garbage. <br /> <br /> A very good thing, though. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Ms. Montford has not had any credit for writing or directing since her adoption. There is justice in the world.
