A film about a number of filmmakers, who want to make a documentary about a new kind of surfing in shark infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies including animals or vicious monsters, I thought maybe it was my kind of movie ... it was not !!! This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it! There is a lot of accidental humor in it and the nasty beast is an incredible joke. In the final scene, the main characters * roll *, the feet move visibly in the air! It's ridiculous! Good to laugh anyway. If it was only the lack of talent between the actors, the embarrassing and stupid dialogs and the hilarious crocodile, it would at least have fun, but it gets worse: I guess the film makers have noticed as he was weak, so they put together the old idea of ​​"selling sex" ... Totally, I mean TOTALLY without any reason one of the leading actresses shows her boobs to the beast. And somewhere around the beginning, there is a kind of "makeup" meaningless. This is the last ingredient that made me totally unhealthy. It's amazing how people spend time producing such garbage! If you are looking for a real waste of time: watch this movie !!!
