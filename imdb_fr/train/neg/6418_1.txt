Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror movies. I never look at them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to finish it. Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than that ... the movie? Anyway, we did not really expect it to be good ... we just went to laugh about it. Nice with me ... It's hard to ruin the movie for others in the theater, but since it was just couples talking and going out, it did not matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes 2 Other people left to sneak into Borat, a movie I would have liked to see again. The movie was not scary, and not stupid so it would be funny ... it was boring. It was not terrible, like "Baby Genuises", it was terrible ... not at all entertaining. To avoid. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not an expert, but it seems like the problem of the horror industry nowadays is that you can have a boring and not scary PG-13 horror, or you can have a horrible R horror movie too bloody or too disgusting for people. <br /> <br /> Want a horror PG-13 who fears but who is funny? See "The grudge". Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it may bore you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
