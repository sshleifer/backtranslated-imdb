The scenario is so laughable ... It makes the replicas of actors rigid and unrealistic, not to believe. There are repetitions of sentences - "my sweet little divine girl" and minor variations of that phrase that comes to mind ... and it's just a sloppy soap opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Worse, the music is so FALSE! Plus, Bluesy's main "theme" is horribly picturesque and totally wrong for that. And it is overused mainly because the instrumentation, texture and layout of this theme never change, even when the emotional context of the scene changes. <br /> <br /> Thereafter, whenever it appears, it comes out like a sore thumb. transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The music is old-fashioned, and it's as if the author is writing music for a soap opera or a sitcom - a low-budget Canadian sitcom of the 80s - and that makes it we're still about to launch an advertisement. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, there's a lot of suraction and it's really amazing that many of these characters only use ONE guy. from the NY accent - a thick Bronx accent. I do not know if this is the limited ability of actors to only know * a * New York accent - or the ability of the director to notice such a flagrant anomaly. <br /> <br /> In In the end, it is the amateur scenario with its lead lines that makes all this "film" ... blow. When a foundation is unstable and unstable, it can not be built without its defects being exponentially more damaging and unflattering.
