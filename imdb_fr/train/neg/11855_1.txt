It's one of those movies that goes on the cable at two o'clock in the afternoon to entertain the bored housewives as they iron. The acting is second-rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to doze all through the movie. And may God help Gina Gershon. His accent is too exaggerated. It does not look like a real English woman. It seems forced and bogus, a bit like acting. She should stick to what she does best, a scammer in the lesbian showgirl who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are not better. They are two-dimensional. empty, tasteless and silly. How should we assume to care about these people? At one point, Christy Scott Cashman gets lost in Central Park. Really? It's not that difficult to navigate in Central Park. Just follow any path. Not only did I not care about any of the characters, but I hated them outright. Fisher Stevens was the only reason I stayed with this wreck of a movie. Even his brilliant humor could not save this dying fish. Each scene is typical of the romantic comedy and there is nothing left to surprise us. The scenario was awful, just like the actor. If you catch this fish, throw it back!
