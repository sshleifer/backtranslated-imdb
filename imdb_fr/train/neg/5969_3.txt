*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you think to watch this movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is so predictable that it makes no difference if you read this or not anyway) <br /> <br /> If you are wondering whether to see "Coyote Ugly" or not : do not do it ! This is not worth the ticket money or the VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", one could say. The plot itself is as superficial as possible, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American dream. The beautiful girl from a small town who is having great success in New York. The few desperate attempts to give the film all its depth fail, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" of the relationship of Violet with her boyfriend, etc. McNally (director) tries to arouse public pity and his sadness has no chance of succeeding in this attempt because of the bad scenario and the superficial game. In particular, Piper Perabo fails to convince any of Jersey's fears of singing in front of an audience. John Goodman, who represents the small glimmer of hope of this film, is the only good thing (and funny enough) about "Coyote Ugly". <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. First film "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this ... what has become of great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? It was true Bruckheimer. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a superficial movie with pretty women for a casual evening, you should go see "Charlie's Angels" (it's a lot funnier, entertaining and self-ironic) ) instead of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 of 10).
