Wow ... where to start ... picked it up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99. It's three dollars that I will never see again ... never ... and for what? I'll tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring, and anxious discussions in college that seemed more appropriate for a movie for life than the horror movie on the box. (That the marketing droids who designed it burn in hell for all eternity). Follow this with a little cheap gore (not even a good gore, you see ...) and a plot plot in the end that comes out of nowhere, and that makes no sense. Ugly, ugly, ugly ... <br /> <br /> Are there qualities that redeem? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, there were six breasts involved, but it's not worth the trouble that I've been losing three dollars for a long time. Without them, it could have been on Sci-Fi at, say, two or three o'clock in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
