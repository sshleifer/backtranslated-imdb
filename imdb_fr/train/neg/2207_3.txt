Hammerhead is a combination of mad scientist and killer shark film genres. Jeffrey Combs interprets the mad scientist mentioned above who develops a creature man / hammerhead shark. Oddly enough, this being is actually his son, whom he has turned into this monster to prevent him from dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of associates is invited to the private island of the scientist. They end up being used as baits or shark companions. For some unknown reason, the IT manager has been integrated into this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he turns out to be an ingenious, but somewhat overweight, Ramboesque hero. I assume that he learned to handle an assault rifle as part of his day-to-day work as a front-line supporter. A typical day for this computer scientist likely involves repairing someone's network connection followed by a call to shoot down the wrongdoers. Or perhaps a call to repair someone's PC must be programmed between physical confrontations with terrestrial human-shark hybrids? In any case, it is amazing and saves the day. He even had the girl. <br /> <br /> The shark man is a slightly lame creation but OK, I guess, judging by the effects in general in this movie. And the film is moving at a decent pace. It's a complete hokum, of course, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and you expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflict experienced by a man turned into a deadly fish lander then you have no one to blame except yourself. In this case, there are firearms, gore, girls and maybe even a helicopter that explodes. It's bad, but not as bad as you might say.
