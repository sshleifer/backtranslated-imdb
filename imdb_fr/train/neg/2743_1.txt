I must admit that I did not finish this movie because it was incredibly stupid and not worth seeing. I looked at him in a room full of children who, too, did not make fun of stupid and rude humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with the sphincters and genitals that he crushes the real story I grew up with. THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR CHILDREN! Besides the fact that the content is so brutal, the movie is just stupid, poorly structured and without intelligence. What a loss of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were young and you loved it, do not waste your time watching a movie that sabotages it so much that it makes you angry. Buy your books the book instead.
