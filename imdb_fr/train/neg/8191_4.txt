"Fred Claus" somehow avoids becoming this year's "The Santa Clause" by having at least more fun moments than Tim Allen's, but that does not mean the game is worth it, which makes it it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Over holiday movies, it's artificial and sentimental. But in reality, this could be the least of his worries, because "Fred Claus", boasting of having David Dobkin ("The Shanghai Knights", "The Wedding Crashers") at the helm, contains almost a really fun time as he clumsily walks between a boorish vehicle Vince Vaughn and a blurred Christmas film. In the end, that does not represent much of both. And with a cast composed of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, he is even more disappointed that this one is disappointed. <br /> <br /> Vaughn plays Fred's brother, Nick (Giamatti), tall and very old, who Once upon a time, he and his parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) left him after getting tired of support the favoritism of his parents towards his younger brother. Nick grows up to become Santa Claus (and as the voiceover says, the time freezes over you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a tired repo man in Chicago who has a hard time getting remember his girlfriend. The birthday of Wanda (Weisz). <br /> <br /> He is in trouble with the law and has had to call his younger brother (who looks strangely at least ten years older than him) to get him out of jail. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help in the North Pole toy packaging industry. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism runs up against Santa Claus and the always-happy nature of the elves, even as an efficiency expert (Spacey) checks the operations of the toy factory, too happy that all operations in the Arctic are closed in case of failure. <Br /> <br /> The film, as it says, has its moments, but the padded walking length stretches them throughout its duration. Between them are heaps of Christmas film clich√©s that have been better treated in, say, "Elf" and the sentimental attempts are as endearing as last year's fruitcake. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as usual, wears his rude charm at the table, but Dan Fogelman's sterilized script REALLY prevents him from doing his thing. Giamatti, under the big suit, brings an old and jovial charm to his iconic character, but unfortunately has to play the supporting role for Fred. Spacey brings his face, but his tricks usually end in a vague wave. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Fred Claus" becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those who participate deserve. Of course, there is worse way to start the season in the cinema, but there are certainly better ways.
