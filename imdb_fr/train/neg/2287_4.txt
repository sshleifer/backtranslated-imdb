I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and I do not really remember it, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy. <br /> <br /> She really did not think what she was doing was bad, even when she left the company to find her religion. <br /> <br /> The photos she took were certainly tamed by today's standards, and that's funny to see men with cameras get all excited and politicians pontificate about misdeeds pornography. David Strathairn (good night and good luck) played a vital role in this regard. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an exceptional biopic about the most famous pin-up of all time.
