If the film that suits you best is easy, regressive, indulgent, anti-establishment and anti-civilization, this film is ideal. Very poorly scripted, with dialogues often inaudible and a portable camera held in every sense, it is a film that presents the world in a simplistic Manichean way: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors ) are insensitive and moaning and predator monsters at worst. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is an infantile (literally) primitive (criage) and infantile (literally) regression in a primitive cave-like space in the woods, utopia taking the form of a rave feast . wood (naturally ...). Shows all the weaknesses of a first movie, and much more.
