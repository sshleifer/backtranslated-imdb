The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "Woman". I do not know if it was intentional or not, but if the German public had a good laugh during last year's Fantastic Film Festival, during the screening of this film. <br /> <br /> But these are the only laughing festival the film has. Not that it was meant to laugh, it's a horrible movie for heaven's sake! A horrible film in more than one way. It's a pity that a place like this was spoiled by horrible, even unbearable moments, for the spectator (definitely not for the faint of heart !!)! And it was not even necessary to show all the things shown. I do not even go into a moral obligation (because movies do not really have that kind of task or function) to discuss what is shown here, but it's a new hollow in the "torture movement "which has developed in the world. last years!
