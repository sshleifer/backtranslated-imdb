When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a good horror film, but it was actually quite different, representing what I would describe as a first sci-fi effort . Karloff and Lugosi both play against scientists (respectively Rukh and Benet) - competitors until Rukh wins with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was at least a little rough (so science fiction, focusing on fiction), but Rukh exploits a kind of Andromeda ray that allows him to look at the earth "several billion ago years." In prehistoric times, a huge meteorite hit Africa, leaving deposits of a substance that scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. Much of the film is rather tedious in Africa, in search of meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and exploits to create a great weapon, unfortunately becoming infected with a kind of disease that makes him great weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both very good here. Lugosi takes a role in which he is quite good, although I frankly found him a little unconvincing - especially during the scenes taking place in Africa. The story also worked a little and, even though it caught my attention, it did not captivate me. Since this is actually a sci-fi rather than a horror movie and this science fiction was in its infancy, I guess the film has to be a little lax. It was OK - nothing more, but nothing less than that. 4/10
