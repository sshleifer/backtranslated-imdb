I do not think you can be much worse than that. Gather bad actors, fake members and three stupid stories, and what do you get? This useless excuse of tariff B for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the poor video quality and the acting of the actors is really pathetic, especially when you import the 25-year-old usually grandma bun on little ears. Moreover, the man is fine, but the woman is rather ugly. "It fits you well!" DO NOT! The werewolf in this one was the best of the three, I would say, but it's still not impressive because it's a bad suit. The woman's face afterwards was pretty decent for Halloween, but not for a movie about werewolves. <br /> <br /> The more you tell stories, the more it gets worse. There are two lesbians in this next who are completely delayed from his ridicule. The set "I also want to be a werewolf" "How can you do this to me ?!" Was stupid to say. You asked for it now, overcome it! We will not even talk about the werewolf ... it's a rat! <br /> <br /> The third is nonsense ... almost 45 minutes of racing and annoying storytelling make up this story and the entire poster has still not made it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, too bad ... who could not even hear some parts was stupid. The effects on the animals were either rats or pigs, which was stupid. They could not use the lion sounds? I guess no, GOOD movies use that. Well, if you like B rates, it's good for you. I have this movie since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and I'm going to buy ALL Werewolf movie and watch it more than once, but it's just me. If you prefer the good ones, do not waste your money. I beg you!
