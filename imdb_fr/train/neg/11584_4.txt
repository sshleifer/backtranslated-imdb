About twenty minutes after the beginning of the movie, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were pretty dull. Sometimes something nice would happen, but things would slow down again. Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded and the end of this movie was not bad at all. However, it was by no means sufficient to justify sitting for the first 90 minutes. So, I would say that the film was generally mediocre and that, considering all the talents of the casting, I would say that it is a disappointment.
