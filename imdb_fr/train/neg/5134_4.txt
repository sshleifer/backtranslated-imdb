SCARECROWS seems to be a failed horror meets a supernatural movie. A gang of thugs commits a paramilitary payroll robbery at Camp Pendleton, California. They board a cargo plane that kidnaps the pilot and his daughter and asks them to be flown to Mexico. On the way, a greedy thief decides to bail out with the money that lands in a cornfield watched by strange scarecrows. They are not just banal scarecrows ... they can kill. The acting is not better than the horrible dialogue. And the attempts of humor are not funny. Very small budget and shot entirely in the dark. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
