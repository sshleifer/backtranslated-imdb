Good movies can not only be based on a beautiful garden and a hilltop. Surprised to see him won two awards. Extremely overestimated. I first saw this kind of film from China, visually stunning, but also with something captivating to say, well, there are more than 10 years and I'm sure there are still others. He's not one of them, I'm afraid.
