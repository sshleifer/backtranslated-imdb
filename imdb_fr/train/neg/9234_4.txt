Redo today, this film would be a black comedy very disturbing and very disturbing. Criminal harassment, obsession and a network of lies and manipulations give 1948 a burst of innocence are not cute. Drake plays the stalker, an impassive user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the victim of criminal harassment, alternately angry and unconscious. <br /> <br /> Extremely disturbing; I have not been able to watch classic novels with the same suspension of disbelief since. <br /> <br />
