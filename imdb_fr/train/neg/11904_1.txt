The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar Hotel suggested that the Wenders had lost their vision, their ability to tell fascinating stories through a map of the moving image. I fear that The Land of Plenty seals the coffin by being an extremely unimaginative, obviously sentimental and clich√© film. The characters are completely flat and stereotyped, writing, intrigue and direction are at best amateurs. For the first time in a long time, I was eager to see the movie come to an end so I could continue my life. The delirium torn by the war of the uncle, the patriotic abstract looking at the sky at the end ... everything seemed so simple and pathetic, hardly the work of a filmmaker who had once done an irresistible magic to the screen. What happened? I'm afraid the days of experimentation, insightful writing and interesting filming opportunities are no longer behind him. Let's hope he gets his inspiration back ... At the Toronto Film Festival, where I saw the film, Wenders was there to introduce it. Completely devoid of humility, he offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you'll enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he can not be more wrong
