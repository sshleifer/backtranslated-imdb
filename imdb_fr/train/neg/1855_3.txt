It's the craziest movie I've ever seen, but in all honesty, it's watchable and rather funny. I do not think the filmmakers wanted it to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer who is sprayed with a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow (in the middle of winter). He then turns into a killer snowman that is enough to make you laugh alone. This movie is really stupid but it's funny. The killings are hilarious. I would not advise you to buy it (as I already did - the cover looked good!), But if the film goes on TV one night and you want to laugh, then hang in there .
