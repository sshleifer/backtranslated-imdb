Unmissable and immemorial remake of a famous old English film. Although it is excessively decried as a total disaster (which is not the case), it never creates tension and does not betray its televised origins. Richard Burton somnambulum in his role, and the closed face of Sophia Loren (in this film) also does not show much passion. (**)
