Do not waste your time and money with this one. The half-decent troupe might let you believe that this teen thriller, although it is about to break any record, could entertain slightly for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> It will not scare you, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. You'll wonder how this movie ever finished production. Yes, it's really poor.
