It is not so much that the SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION has little potential. Indeed, the phenomenon of the under-explored title is quite intriguing and, at least for the first half, this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way that the horror of the '90s can not disturb. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's disruptive performance and the intricate plot, this potential thriller loses its way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, presented here before his built-in horror fan base has accumulated, is the average guy Sam. Of course, average guys do not stay long in horror movies, so after a well done presentation, we see the different parts of Sam's body ignite. Soon, it will ignite other people, to the dismay of the girlfriend Lisa, incarnated without memory by Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> While the title of the film evokes a monster delighted with fire, director Hooper chooses to make Sam an unenthusiastic killer. This approach gives the film an extra human depth that would otherwise be lacking, but it also prevents us from actually fearing the human flamethrower. We wonder if it would have worked better as a nasty direct effort against everyone in the manner of a nightmare on Elm Street. <br /> <br /> SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a nice symbolic effort when everything is said and done. This will bring an added attraction to Dourif fans and those who can not have enough horror from the 1990s, whether good, bad or in between, but only on slow nights.
