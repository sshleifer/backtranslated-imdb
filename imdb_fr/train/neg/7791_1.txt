I saw the unedited original German version and was surprised at the seriousness of this film. Thinking I saw my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and others, nothing could have prepared me for that! It was really painful to sit around during this movie because there is no script, no good acting and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than just white makeup and their old clothes, their good outfit would not be spoiled by ketchup and marmalade stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then watch it, for all the others, do not do it, you'll regret it!
