waste of my life, .... the manager should be embarrassed. why people feel that they need to make worthless movies will make no sense to me. when she died in the end, it made me laugh. I had to change channels several times throughout the movie because I became embarrassed to watch such a mediocre acting game. Let's hope the guy who played Heath never gets back to work. In addition to that, I hope that the director will never make another film and that his salary will be taken again for this shit. {0.02 out of 10}
