I do not see many reasons to enter this film in detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of "A Season in Hell", recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, taking pictures of American prisoners who would still be held in prison. horrible camps and return without engaging the enemy. <br /> <br /> Big luck. What if he did nothing more than sneak in, take pictures and sneak? Who would come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> This is essentially a celebration of Stallone's muscles. In preparing for his mission, we see his muscles well oiled inflated. (They are oiled and protruding everywhere.) There is the ritual of attaching black leather, ugly rifles and even uglier knives. The black pistols are cleaned, assembled with powerful slaps and almost as greased as the muscles of Stallone. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough weight to pass a lock through the enemy's forehead. The knife is sharpened with slender picks. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his prisoners of war are betrayed by one or two of Washington's suits, cynical politicians who, you can bet, have never had the same high school fight. No courage, you know? Just sit with your feet on the desk and drink some foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The film does what it is planned to do, but what has been decided to do is fantasy. The popular myth of the mid-1980s that there were countless numbers of MIAs silently guarded in miserable camps by North Vietnamese is deliberately drawn to the myth. The stickers were ubiquitous. (Free our MIAs.) Why would they keep them? This has never been fully motivated, but perhaps to turn POWs into slave labor - in a country that has absolutely no resources other than labor. Or perhaps for their propaganda value as an instrument of humiliation of the United States - a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world. <br /> <br /> As a captive, Rambo is treated in a medieval way by the North. Vietnamese. Drenched in his neck with pig excrement, he pulled out his wrists, his muscles still visible. Then, not content with the subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought to play the role of the Gestapo officer - "Vee haff, it's for you to memorize." High-tech type, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just the remains of pork. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until "this country loves us as much as we love it". another myth that veterans returning from Vietnam would be uniformly spit and cursed, that's why I guess we elected so many people to Congress and appointed others to senior positions. The last three presidential candidates lost were part of this despised group. At least Rambo's aimless drift gave way to a sequel, which arrived fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> The action movies with Schwarzenegger, Willis and others have been hastily put together, but Rambo has no sense of humor. He walks slowly in his fantasmatic ideological marsh, kills without pity, barely speaks, barely speaks, barely speaks. Talking is a sign of weakness.
