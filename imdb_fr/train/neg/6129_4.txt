Judging by this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not put Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great comics on screen mute. There is simply not enough. Perhaps he was developing his style but was sabotaging himself by taking his first big hits too seriously. In any case, all of his tricks are reminiscent of the hottest funny men, but Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's prodigious ingenuity are lacking. It also undermines his personality by dressing and walking like the character of Chaplin's tramp. His marks are childlike innocence, a timid approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity by looking perplexed, fluttering his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his index finger. The comedy in Langdon's films is a result of fate that has thrown various obstacles on his journey, which he tries to overcome in a shady or naive manner or with a minimum of physical appearance, such as throwing stones on an imminent tornado for the hunt, stall a ruined building two by four or rocks by dodging lifting a leg so that they roll under it. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a running race across the country to publicize the shoes of a competing company, he manages to win by pure luck. There is nothing here that has not been done much better by the Big Three.
