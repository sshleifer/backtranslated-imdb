A gave him a "2" instead of a "1" (awful) because it's undeniable that a lot of visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into special effects and illustrations. But that was not enough to save him. <br /> <br /> The "sepia" genre with faded and faded colors has been done many times in other films. Nothing new there. I can see that there were some hat tips to other old classic movies. OKAY. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But a movie must be fun and interesting, not something that would make you sleepy. <br /> <br /> The script and the scenario of this film was terrible, the characters in two dimensions. Slow motion. Some scenes were nice to watch, but in the end, overall, it was rather boring, I could not recommend it.
