For those who love depressing movies with lousy characters and a sordid story, this one is for you! From the dull atmosphere of New York, which presents itself as an extremely sinister and almost hopeless place, to two main characters devoid of any moral sense, this film is a real negative point. <br /> <br /> The awarding of the academy was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, who had just released his freedom to show what he wanted, with all the codes abandoned morals, wanted to celebrate this fact. The filmmakers were then like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited spending account at the local candy store. Thus, Hollywood gave viewers (for the first time probably) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, nudity, homelessness and other images and sounds as wonderful as its twisted brain would think as being attractive .... work. <br /> <br /> He also hoped, I am sure, shock the public in general. Well, it's been successful at this level. The spectators were stunned by what they said and heard and the Academy, proud to be able to display garbage and earn money at the same time, could not help but pay tribute to this golden junk. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, I found this film fascinating too. However, seeing him again in the 1990s left a bad taste in my mouth that I never looked to see him again. <br /> <br /> The acting game was good, but so what? Playing in several movies is good. Nobody ever said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly talented in his youth playing crazy lunatics. He was a bit like the Johnny Depp of his day, playing characters such as "Ratso Rizzo" in the movie, and then "Rain Man" later. Yes, "Ratso" is a character you'll never forget and "Joe Buck" (Voight), a character you want to forget, but the story is so sordid that it crushes the acting game. <br /> <br /> This film is not "art" and it does not deserve its many prizes; it only increased the envelope in 1969 and that is why we remember it so tenderly in the hearts of filmmakers and critics. It's two hours of blasphemy and ultra-sleazy religious beating, glorifying crazies (Andy Warhol is even caught in the act - unsurprisingly) and generally ignoble people. <br /> <br /> I liked the catchy song, "Everybody's Talking '" that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was wrong because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it ... and few people have ever heard of Neil (who is their loss). And as mentioned above, the name "Ratso Rizzo" you stay! <br /> <br /> The film is a landmark event but, in a negative sense, I fear it is considered "official" by Hollywood. He went down to the toilet and has been in the sewers ever since.
