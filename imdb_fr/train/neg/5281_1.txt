The humor in Who's Your Daddy is so bad that I actually closed my eyes in some scenes. Close-ups of cum are not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so rude and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching Who's Your Daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling.
