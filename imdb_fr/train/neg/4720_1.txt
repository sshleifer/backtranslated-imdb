When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda again in action. Although Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main reason for the dissolution of Yugoslavia, this is not mentioned in this "documentary" by Bogdanovich whose name indicates that he is Serbian and that his film is far from being goal. This is a lie pushed by the Milosevic regime. All others are guilty. Only Serbs were right and were victims, even though most of the war criminals tried in The Hague are Serbs, even though the Serbs committed genocide against Bosniaks and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, all recognized The break-up of Yugoslavia could not be avoided because the Serbs did not want to release control of their nationalism over the Yugoslav federal government. For example, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia have been forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests. are interested in an objective documentary about the break-up of Yugoslavia, and documentary-based facts, that's not it. You should watch "Yugoslavia: The Death of a Nation", the Discovery Channel and the BBC.
