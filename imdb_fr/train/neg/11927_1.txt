Without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I persevered to the end, because there must surely be something here, but no. Intrigue, when it is not about clichés, goes to the point of non-existence; the dialogue that is supposed to be from the street is simply trivialized; characters never develop beyond sketches; the sets are clichés. Worse, given his co-director, photography is not terrible. <br /> <br /> The comments expressed elsewhere that enhance this feeling alongside Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are far from reality; The lives of the saints are devoid of innovation, let alone depth and shade. In short, their job. A ruthless publisher might be able to shorten the time, but it's a sixth-generation, one-million-pound film project; disjointed and swollen with his own pretensions. The fact that he has received funding (surely only because of Rankin's name) while other small films are competing for financial hardship is depressing for the British film industry.
