It was probably the worst movie of all time, seriously. I could actually do better myself, it was not even well configured. It's as if this film had a budget of $ 5 and there was still money. Do not look at him. I did not even go through this movie, I had to turn it off. I gave it a 1/10 because it was hilarious that the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but in reality it became a very bad comedy. Basically, a group of girls crashed into a car, broke a lighthouse and the owner of that car chased her. What I saw was a woman with a gun telling a bunch of girls to undress, what is it? it must be a kind of nerdy porn movie too.
