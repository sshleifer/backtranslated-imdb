I saw this work at a film festival in California. God, what was the director thinking? Film teachers should use this film as a case study of what NOT to do when making a short film. First of all, this project makes absolutely no sense. The film takes place partly in "The Waystation", a stupid stupid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> The acting game is more than bad. So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy. The lead actress Julia Reading is a step below the actor in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's as if the director had no idea how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than acting was the dialogue, which bordered on the absurd. The writer (which I suppose he is also the director) writes each character as if he were auditioning for a nasty comic. <br /> <br /> The overall value of the production is pretty good, but to be honest, with such a bad movie it's easy to ignore. The design of the production is rather good, even if the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar. The costumes and makeup are ok, and I understand that the production was running on a small budget. It's just when the characters are talking or they are trying to advance the plot that the movie is taking place in a crappy crap. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is awful. It's as if the director / screenwriter has watched a lot of sci-fi movies and threw all the parts he liked into a mixer. My only hope is that he used other people's money for that, because if he used his, he's an idiot.
