Being the only film I could see at the Nordische Filmtage in LÃ¼beck this year, this year's festival will remain for me as an absolute record. <br /> <br /> This film, announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick shit! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have saved the film. For example. the plot: after the first 15 minutes, it was clear that John was sick, the neighboring girls were not real and he had killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting until the blood runs for me has nothing to do with sex), but unfortunately, it's not the only disgusting images to be shown. Everything else has been copied by other administrators, for example. Lynch, but of course without genius. <br /> <br /> To summarize the entire film and save time and money to other viewers: a guy loses his girlfriend, his girlfriend comes home, the latter kills his girlfriend and gets upset Then, a guy imagines hot but crazy neighbor girls, a guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or at least he thinks it), in the end he realizes that he is crazy and his girlfriend and his new lover are still in his apartment .. bad story, bad actors, pictures, which make you want to throw up ... 1 of 10 (1 point for the fact, you realize what point you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish - at least one advantage of the evening - and you can not choose 0 point here).
