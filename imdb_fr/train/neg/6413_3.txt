My friends and I went in this movie without knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we went out, we were only a little more informed about what the plot was really about. Although this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, I certainly would not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. Ask perhaps a friend to rent it for you (it's not even worth the cost of the rental) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When a movie is so complicated that you have no idea what's happening before In the last five minutes, there is not much to say about his defense. The acting was ok, more than you expect from this movie, and some of the shots were good, but everything was bogged down by a lame plot and a mediocre storyline. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually so bad that as soon as it came out, I went to buy a ticket to see a good movie just to clean my mind. I recommend that you all skip the first step and watch a good movie instead.
