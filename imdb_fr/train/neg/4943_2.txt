I watched 3 episodes of Caveman, and I do not know why I keep going, except perhaps to wait for it to get better. <br /> <br /> For me, this show only pumping advertising without real humor. As we sat watching these shows, we all speculated on what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> The episode of the woman cave woman with an attitude was actually a big, yes, for us. she is rough in a theater and acts harshly on strangers, and to tell the truth, she needed a slap. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very good critic, taking everything into account, but I must say that Cavemen is comparable to the old show, my mother, the car. I give him a 2, just because they deserve 1 better than a 1 because they actually spent money there.
