It's hard to know what was going on in the minds of Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the film is presented as a comedy, but there's no real joke next to the names of raw characters (Capt B. Dick, Sgt Shaved Balls). The rest of the film is a (probably) unintentionally amusing affair with ridiculously unsynchronized voice-overs ("actors" essentially reading their lines without any feeling of feeling), "futuristic" computer screens full of spelling mistakes and a plot scenario. almost meaningless <br /> <br /> Even though 65% of viewers gave this film a perfect score of 10 out of 10, it's the complete opposite of what a good movie is. It may be interesting to watch with friends, but this film deserves only a "2" out of ten ... slightly higher than the lowest possible score only because of the fact that the writers were able to convince blacks star in this film.
