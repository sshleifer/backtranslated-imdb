The idea is to do something interesting in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked. Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest longer than that. When we come to a point, it is so morally monumental that I thought I misunderstood. But I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of an Osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time and who worked at different times without realizing that they shared the same dwelling. His friend asks "But what about weekends?" Sean does not have an adequate explanation. Sean then tells the story of his own similar problem, namely that he is not sure that his girlfriend is still living at home because he works during the night and works during the day so they never see each other This has been going on for three weeks. But his friend does not ask, "Yes, but as I said before, what about the weekend, you have to see it at that time." It does not make sense. you, Sean, do you take drugs or something like that? "But let's be generous and assume they work every seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean check if soap and towels have been used. (In fact, oddly, he begins to carry the soap with him.) But what about the conditioner and shampoo, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush of his girlfriend? Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drinks? Is there anything missing? Did we buy? In the bedroom, was the shared bed made or not? Are his clothes being used and exchanged for clean clothes? Is the laundry basket fuller? In the toilet, is the seat raised or lowered? Good sorrow! <br /> <br /> And to top it off, Paul decides to leave his job early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home. Why does not he just call it? <br /> <br /> But the situation is getting worse. In the last act, although no one told Vincent where the rest of the group was heading, he managed to find them. Lenny's love and Sean's girlfriend seem to be the best friends and also manage to find the group. There is not the slightest attempt to explain these extraordinarily improbable coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the dialogue is good, but not good enough to compensate for weak characters or lame history. I heard one of the actors interviewed and he promised "no weapons, no drugs, no corsets." I thought "awesome". But after half an hour of boredom, I screamed on the screen, "I want guns! I want drugs! I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> It would not have taken many things to solve these problems but on the official website, the director boasts that the film was not mounted to the screenplay. That's all you need to know.
