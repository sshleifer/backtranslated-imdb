I saw all kinds of "Hamlet" s. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and to the point, Laurence Olivier was the best - hands down. But now we come to the version of Bard's film presented by Maximilian Schell. <br /> <br /> For one of them, it is a dubbed version of a German television production of the venerable chestnut of William Shakespeare. But if there is a slower, heavier, sluggish and less staged version somewhere, it must have been played at the primary school level. <br /> <br /> Having seen it on MST3K is helping, with Mike and the robots, to joke good shots against the old boy, piercing the abundance of black and white television, Shakespeare and wisdom (? ) Germans acting Play in English and make it look like a rejection of Ingmar Bergman. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs. Best lines? "I'm going to unleash the Great Dane", "I do not believe," breathe "", "Meet the Beatles", "Hey, dad, will you help me with my science project" and, my favorite, during a party - "Garrison Keillor leaves Germany (YAAAY !!)". <br /> <br /> But Schell also plays Shakespeare's biggest character, like a department store model, but not as expressive. No doubt he is an excellent actor, but here he stands out about as well as Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice". Never seen that one? You GOTTA watch these two movies on a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a case where it is true that you are much better than reading the book. At least the book is not doubled by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> A star only for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good night, prince not so nice.
