The plot has already been described by other critics, so I'll just add that the reason I wanted to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her glory. Without a doubt. the sexiest and prettiest examples of "totty chic" having been committed to celluloid. From his time and his era, only Jane Asher, also exquisite, is getting closer. What about actresses with musicians brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this film will not disappoint. She has a beautiful figure and none of this is left to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very poor and makes its time, done at a very cheap price. The song that covers the opening credits seems to drag on and is appalling.
