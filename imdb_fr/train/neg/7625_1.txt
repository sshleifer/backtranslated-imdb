This is your only spoiler warning. What a state of sadness in our cinema when non-professional objects like this one are considered "worthy of an Oscar". <br /> <br /> I divide the content into three levels. The first is the theater. Here, the viewer is stagnant and the power lies in the presentation of the actor and, above all, in the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good writer because he or she knows the meaning of words better. The best playwrights know how to create images that the sterile scene can not show. <br /> <br /> The second level is a movie. In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer does not sit in the same place all the time. With film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to a strong writing. In addition, the film can handle everyday elements, such as sound and color, in an almost surreal way. <br /> <br /> The last level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated on paper, then reinvented by the reader. A novel can contain many more details than one could conceive for a movie studio. <br /> <br /> That's why adaptations can go, but never down. The novelties are never better than the base film (see the tens of cents available in your local bookstore), while the film can not transmit the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Films can rarely be turned into pieces and parts can always be transformed. <br /> <br /> As for "The Last Picture Show", it fails. It's a film that should stay on the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything. The characters speak and act in the same way, it is pure futility. Add to that an unpleasant soundtrack and you have a totally unassailable movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in my high school theater class with twenty other aspiring thespians. The instructor was delighted with the sadness of the film. What is sad is how stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious. If it had been in color, the scenes of impotence, the party by the pool and the old prostitute would be considered an excellent comedy. Look what Lucas did with "American Graffiti" a few years later. <br /> <br /> American high school must start teaching the film ABOUT teaching rather than trying to teach WITH the film. Two powerful films in pictures: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Trust them, not that. This is the last one I want to see. 1 out of 5
