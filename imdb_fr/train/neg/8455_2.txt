"Arahan" does not add anything positive to the Kung Fu genre. To compare this confused film with the inspired madness and quality of Stephen Chow's films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First, battle scenes are not new. All that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fights in smart animated pictures need logic. It seems useless to serve shots that have no damaging effect, as in the following "Matrix". <br /> <br /> Attractive lead actress So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen but never convincingly defeated the physical demands of the role Ziyi Zhang had done easily in "House Of Flying Daggers" . Having a martial arts background is very useful in Kung Fu movies. Embodying inexperienced actors in these areas is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in "Asumi"), unless you are a very talented director, which proves "Arahan", but Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
