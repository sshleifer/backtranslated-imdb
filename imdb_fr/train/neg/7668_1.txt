As soon as the attacker started, I knew we had problems! The premise is at best laughable. The scenario was even worse, if that were possible. <br /> <br /> The acting was steep and the actors had a sense of inexperience. You expect more from Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as if from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she was VERY amazing as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff have chosen a shabby movie to try to stage their returns. <br /> <br /> The continuity occurred throughout the film. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> In the end, I want to find 90 minutes of my life. They can keep the money, but leave me time! Such a waste.
