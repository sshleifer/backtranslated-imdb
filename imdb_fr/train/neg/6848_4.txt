I must say that I am quite disappointed by this movie "horror". I was not even scared looking at him. It's not very disturbing either .... I was able to guess the end of the film ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a really scary movie. .. I would like other movies to stop copying (eg, the trademark: long hair). Please, give me some originality. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie.
