As I sat in front of the television watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could have done with that!" Chances are, you too. It starts to intrigue. A British park warden living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a pretty, dark-haired brunette (Lisa Zane) whom he met in a park not long ago. Then, one day, she disappears. The police are unable to find documents proving that she has ever existed and Firth does her own research. So far, so good. Just when he is about to give up, he turns to his best friend (Billy Zane), who stumbles upon his old life in the sordid Los Angeles underground: drugs, discos and movies, then his story of mental instability. . At this point, Firth's life is in danger and the film falls apart. None of the characters in Lisa Zane's past are really interesting. The film is moving slowly and there is very little action. There is a secondary plot about the missing drug money, but it's only a throwaway. No lawsuits, no cliffhanging sequences, and no suspense. Just a few dull blows and a lot of boring characters talk. One thing to note, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear in a scene together. At the end of the movie, you are torn between asking yourself what could have been and trying to stay awake.
