Scary Movie 3 is so stinky that it's hard to express it with words. This makes movies like Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar-winning films. Let's just say that. <br /> <br /> The original Scary movie was a lot of fun, one of the best 90s parody movies from a big team that has a world with Do not be a threat to the south-central while drinking your juice in the hood. But what happened? After the tragedy of Scary Movie 2, I thought the cast and team change would help, but it's even worse. <br /> <br /> In 20 minutes, I smiled twice. Not a laugh, the jokes were recycled and the originality was obviously not a factor. The fact that at this stage of writing, the majority of users of this site voted 10/10, made me feel physically sick. When there are big films like School of Rock out, which actually have funny jokes, whoever wastes his gut money like this needs his head examined. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
