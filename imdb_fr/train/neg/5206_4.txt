Adapting the theater to the cinema is often a bad idea, because they are two different mediums. Do you think it's a good idea to make ZULU a play? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats are sitting in a tent panting "Blimey there are thousands over there" Great movie and bad play <br /> <br /> For a play to make good cinema requires two essential elements <br /> <br /> 1) An excellent distribution that creates chemistry on the screen <br /> <br /> 2) An excellent dialogue <br /> <br /> > On paper, Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles. The story revolves around a hit-man played by Palminterri who breaks into a house to kill a woman embodied by Cher, most of the actions taking place inside the house. I could not take both characters seriously, although it was perhaps a fault of the script that could not decide whether he was trying to be serious or funny. Since the story is very static, it is of the utmost importance that the dialogue shine and once again, because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay, it embarrasses most of all, the bulk of the conversation revolving around sexual acts. if you want to see a beautiful translation of a play transferred to a big screen, give up FAITHFUL and look instead at 12 ANGRY MEN
