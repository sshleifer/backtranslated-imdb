I have never seen a comedy that is a chore to sit down ... not a laugh in it. Ok, maybe a little laugh for the Michael Clarke Duncan as a tall, bald and black bald virgin. But the rest was shocking. In addition to being empty of laughter, the "skits" drags on! Avoid this one if you appreciate your time and money. HORRIBLE!!! The worst!!!
