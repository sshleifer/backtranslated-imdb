I have heard about this film for many years and finally had the opportunity to see it. A massive massacre of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 finally led to the closure of a cheerleader camp. In 1982, Bambi, a former student, opens it with new recruits, including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they are murdered by the killer, until there remains only one. That's when we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the film, Tom Smothers plays a terrible accent as a Canadian Constable and Paul Reubens prepares his Pee-Wee Herman schtick. Overall, the plot is not very developed and quite lame, but some fun scenes occur, including the House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. The end seems to be united, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is good for about ten or fifteen minutes in total, the rest can be covered quickly. Catch it maybe on TV, but it's not worth buying.
