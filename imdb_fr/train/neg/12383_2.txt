Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian girlfriends come to mind, the story was lame and derivative, the focus on the girlfriend's racial background was clumsy at best, and the loved ones were mostly described like stereotypes, not like real people. I found myself wincing uncomfortably at several times supposed to be fun. I can hardly understand why the local paper here at SF said it was a good movie, and I wonder why the WHO has published the critical review here on IMDb. Very disappointed by this movie, and crazy by the way, I was at the theater to see it, based on the faulty connection with Garden State, which is a much funnier, more inventive and touching movie than this one . I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and so small that I almost left, and some in the audience actually have DID. THAT was followed by a stupid climax at the cemetery, which I saw coming 10 minutes before that happened. I really do not like being misled to spend my money so needlessly.
