of Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> A gang of crooks. The perfect plan. Everything is going wrong. They have problems. The police are outside. They are cornered. What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar to you? <br /> <br /> The film seems to want to be a combination of the theater workshop, the "independent" film and the theater. <br /> <br /> These are the kinds of things that actors like - it's a bit like a studio or a play, because it's basically about focusing on the actors who play ... acting angry, tense, frightened, conversing, plotting, planning - giving the interpreters a lot of leeway to really ruin everything. <br /> <br /> A trio of crooks, a leader, a moron, a brother, proposes a great stratagem of heist. .. and a monkey key is thrown into the works. To top it off, there's a bit of a "bender-bender" and one of the crooks thrown to the rear of the windshield. <br /> <br /> The cops are on their tail and fall into a poetically named bar (and at first) "Dino's last chance". <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, is trying to stay focused on actors' performances and dialouge delivery. He looks at advertising a bright red cigarette from a steaming and smoking Bogart. And he really keeps all the violence on the screen. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome scenes of violence would have given the film a definite advantage. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it is moving too slowly and is getting preparation errors in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems too dark and lost in thought to be an endless tag. Joe Mantaga and these guys are effective as a thirsty, routine police lieutenant who has every inch, but he has not been given much to do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is credible in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to shed blood. <br /> <br /> And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or try to find a way out. <br /> <br /> Spacey does not have the ability to create a lot of tension and maintain it. The characters are arguing for the most part, trying to think of a plan ... and they are too quiet and articulate. There's even a scene where crooks play billiards with a swarm of armed cops right in front, ready to hit. At one point, one of the crooks even calls the police who is right in front of the bar. Oh, brother. Oh worth it. <br /> <br /> These cops will either blow them up or lock them up. Should scammers not be a little scared, a little worried? Meanwhile, all the real action is going on inside. <br /> <br /> Someone pulls a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off the screen and there is still a victim to endure: well, sad somehow . But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway should also have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is doing well in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> A cop who listens for a package of matches at the absolute worst moment is a pretty look. The same goes for a scene where someone passes through the rear windshield. <br /> <br /> The dialigene obviously tries to take a David Mamet approach. It is also profane, but never so realistic or so insightful. <br /> <br /> The film gives the impression of too much it's really ... a low-budget film with an actor behind the camera who for the first time directs other actors from a screenplay "not bad, but requires some extra rewriting". Spacey shows that he is not a terrible director, but he lacks feelings for "shaping a film" and one has the impression that he has just shot an actor. <br /> <br /> These actors are all talented and could work with the material. but they all feel irrelevant. As I said before, the movie really suffers from a broadcast error. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that bad actors have been chosen. I think they found the right cast, but put them in the wrong roles. Changing the roles would have been extremely helpful. <br /> <br /> Have veteran actor Joe Mantagna play the platoon leader, Gary Sinese, the police's angry lieutenant in front of his raven giving orders and barking. his troops, keeping Fischter in his role as "bloodthirsty bastard" and Matt Dillion as sacrificial lamb. It would have been a great improvement. <br /> <br /> When some actors play directly, it works. They can even win Oscars for this. But often, when actors direct, they tend to focus solely on performance. Just shoot the actors who play. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good showcase to make it happen. An excuse for that. <br /> <br /> Hostage situations are pretty much the same in real life, just like stories of transition to adulthood, so it's only natural that movies about them go from one point At a point B. <br /> <br /> There are some very good entries in this genre. Spacey himself appeared in a similar film about the hostages: "The Negotiator". <br /> <br /> This will certainly not become a cult classic, let alone one of the 100 best AFI. and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that will play better on television. It's not worth going out of your way to see. <br /> <br /> I give a 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Spacey's other credit, "Beyond The Sea", would have been better. effort. Hmmm ... maybe that's right. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> by Dane Youssef
