Christ, oh Christ ... One looks stunned, incredulous, and perhaps disturbed, as this mournful exercise of joyless embers unfolds with all the spirit and dexterity of a paralyzed Galapagos turtle. Can such things be? Does this film really exist or was I the involuntary guinea pig of a shady international pharmaceutical company, sipping my coffee without knowing that it had been enriched with a dangerous hallucinogen? I saw a lot of movies and a lot of bad movies, but nothing prepared me for that. in the end, I had become a wreck heckling and crying, tearing the carpet with teeth, like a dog, scratching the walls, screaming until my lungs were sore. I pleaded desperately and frantically for mercy (to whom this call was addressed, I do not know) and longed for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Jesus crying, memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm the most vulnerable, when I'm least able to handle it. I shudder, I fall into tears, I bite my nails until my hands are covered in blood, but I can not quite banish the terrible flashbacks from my mind. I am haunted I am damaged. I am a man's shell. <br /> <br /> Other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film actually, in fact do, exist, or b) I am only a victim among the legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is rather staggering is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal, or at least not been traumatized by this ordeal. Maybe they are part of the operation. God the damned, the maniacs! May God curse them all in Hell !!!!!!
