There is really not much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's pretty harmless, but it's a little more than a dull 1970s heist movie. The movie is not as smart or as sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a retreading of the tired old story of the casino robbery that was made to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the burglary plot was designed by a 3 year old. The plan involves three women ?? One to dismiss unnecessarily and in full view the outside of Circus Cicus, one to pretend to be a waitress, but to cover himself with a blanket at the first opportunity, and one to expose his cleavage. That is just about everything. Complicated, huh? Aside from Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. Lady Las Vegas co-stars Stuart Whitman. When he does not sting Stevens, his involvement in the film is highlighted by one of the craziest gunfights of all time. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie. It has that feeling of the 70s that I still enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas around 1975. But the movie itself is too dull to be rated higher than a 4/10 ?? and it's probably exaggerated. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a perfect waste of cleavage.
