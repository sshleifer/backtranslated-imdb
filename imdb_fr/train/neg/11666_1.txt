As sweet as I can, I sincerely believe that this film is a waste of time. I did not find the film "warm, emotionally satisfying" that others did. I found it boring, with music that distracts from the movie. The story was lean, the characters too drawn and the pedestrian direction. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm going to write a little more about this movie, so I'm doing the 10 minimum line. There is really nothing more to say and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minimums, so that's it. <br /> <br /> An enthusiastic young child finds an emerging talent, looking for time with his aging and embittered mentor despite the caricaturist homophobia father. An aging and bitter mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. the conflict arises. Although I do not think it's a spoiler, I've added the warning in case someone thinks too much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Generally, I find the film boring and pretentious. A waste of time. Honestly, I do not understand what seems to be a fuss, especially on this website, about the transcendent quality of this film. I think it's really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller said, "I'm wrong maybe."
