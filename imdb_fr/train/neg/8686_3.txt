I mark this as a "spoiler" only because of some of my comments on the content of the show, not the content itself. <br /> <br /> It is obvious, from reading these comments, that these Republicans tolerate somehow the show. but scorn it, while Democrats seem to taste the so-called truth. A reader even (it seems) actually indicates that he thinks that these events occurred or could have happened when Bush was in primary school. <br /> <br /> But as for the content as I see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must really be really Bush haters. In the episode I last saw, s02e03, it was shown that the program had to be put in place long before McCain became the favorite for the nomination; because, the other former runners before are all featured. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention, was the use of adding closets. I thought the series must have been made in Europe or the United States, because I do not know any home in the United States that does not have an integrated closet, and most likely among artists. <br /> <Looking at the series, yes, I'm caught off guard, I'm amazed to see what must be a terrible desire of writers to do everything in their power to annoy our president. Certainly, there are problems that most Americans will agree on, but that's not a reason to be so obnoxious in public exhibitions around the world. Maybe the trend has now been defined by this show and this network, so that if Obama or Hillary enter the country, would they continue to produce and broadcast the same kind of "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just one more comment on a commentator's comment. If there had been a kind of change in the 2000 election, according to this author, he was so sure that there would be a totally different and acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. With regard to the events of 911, I think it was put in place when Clinton was president, and I do not see how, if Gore were president, things would be very different.
