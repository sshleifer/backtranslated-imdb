William Hurt diving scientist ??? US agents in charge of the investigation abroad? Did the tainted patient kick his foot after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper missing and not killing Hurt (just the hurt) but the second shot "kill" is dead? Waste of time. It is ridiculous to compare this to the fall of other critics. Oh and at the end of the movie, they decide to start wearing gloves, with the exception of the "evil" agent. Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the "handshake of the virus". What? BTW ... when did IMDb ask for 10 lines of text? I just babble here. Does not this simply remove the content of reviews if you need to have x lines?
