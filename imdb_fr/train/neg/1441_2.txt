I chose this movie only on the cover, thinking I was on an adventure at the Indiana Jones and Doom Temple level. Unfortunately, I had a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn I had before though. This yawn was so great that I could hardly find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The film was so light that even the stereotypes were terribly portrayed. This gives the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach this to your children. I do not. Stay away from this one. If you're looking for family entertainment, you might find something more inspiring elsewhere.
