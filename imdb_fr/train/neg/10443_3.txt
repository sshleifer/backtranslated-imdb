I saw a first showing of this film in New York and I was very disappointed with my friends and just about everyone. The movie was not even so bad it was good; it was as lifeless as a victim of a snakebite. Samual L. Jackson seemed surprisingly tired and the snake effects were weak. It made me think of one of SciFi's films, except that the cheesiness of this film was neither funny nor even camping. Everything seemed worn, flat and overtly formal. I am shocked to say that I really think that Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes that it's a piece of s * it and that it plays with, but the film can not get started, it's a scenario that has no fright. This is the worst kind of lame film: it is without joy.
