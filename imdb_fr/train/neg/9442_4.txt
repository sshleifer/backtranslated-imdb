I tried to like this slasher, as I try to enjoy all the slasher movies. I mean mindless murders mixed with a bit of nudity and a bit of suspense, how can you go wrong? But I think Unhinged is an example of this formula that goes wrong. The main problem is the horrible behavior of the three main girls who have landed in the house. It was as if they were sedated, and that prevented me from becoming more interested in their fate. The film aims at suspense and goosebumps, but the direction by the numbers undermines it and leaves the film rather dull. It's a shame, because if the film had been better executed, it would have been excellent. The story and the characters are rather scary and there are moments of dark and strangely humorous interaction between the mother, the girls and the girl in the old house. There is nudity and occasional bleeding, but not enough to give the film the boost it needed. The final is pretty twisted and scary, and gives the film a big boost but unfortunately, it's too little, too late. So, in my opinion, to avoid, unless you really like obscure movies. There is a lot of potential, but the film does not provide enough to be worth it.
