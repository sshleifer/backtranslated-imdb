One wonders how the script was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other performers are doing a decent job, but since it's neither comedy nor the romantic thriller, it's rather disappointing. <br /> We get the impression that if one of the sons had been sued, it could have been something worthwhile. It is nevertheless interesting to see the story of a story made just before the United States is directly involved in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics had anything to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes, but to end up with something that does not please anyone. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it has historical value.
