Describing this film as waste is unfair. At least searching through the trash can be an exciting hobby. This film was neither captivating nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon knows how to act as he should, and no doubt has a bill from the IRS to settle when he accepted this scenario. The crazy science story of 'Hollow Man' has already been told, better told, without resorting to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs that you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK, they were marketed under the name "The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)", hence the title of the film. <br /> <br /> Clever special effects, a deplorable scenario, a non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
