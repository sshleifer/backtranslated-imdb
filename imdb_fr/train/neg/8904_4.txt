Personally, I loved "The Prophecy" of 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, brilliant, and although the film was not flawless, it was a scary and very original horror movie that entertained immensely . This lower suite of 1998 is still to watch, but mainly because of Walken. Walken is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors of the moment and he stands out again in the role of the late Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays here for the second time. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could be once the determining factor of the celestial war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, "The Prophecy II" also includes a group of terribly annoying characters. Valerie's character was pretty annoying, and Danayel made me even more pissed off. The biggest pain in the ass, however, was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who did not keep quiet. Still, the performance of Walken is not the only redeeming quality of the film. The whole movie is pretty sad and well shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. The scene of Gabriel's resurrection at the beginning is also quite impressive and constitutes one of the coolest moments of one of the films of "Prophecy". "The Prophecy II" is nevertheless the weakest of the three films of "Prophecy" with Walken. Definitely a one-man-show by Christopher Walken, entertaining, but nothing else.
