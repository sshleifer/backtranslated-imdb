I like comics. Although I have problems to fully understand the stories? the visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and degradation. So I thought I knew what I was doing. Surprisingly I understood the main plot ?? but some extremely poor decisions have been made for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really bad "human actor" in close up? ??Why?! It did not work at all !! Horus - and the other gods of Egypt - have been successfully made in computer graphics and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think that with real actors, this film could have been a cult movie. <br /> <br /> What a pity.
