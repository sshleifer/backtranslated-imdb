That could have been interesting? A haunted house story in Japan, from the point of view of a newly installed American family ?? but falls flat because of a too simplistic treatment and the inadequacy of the actors and the director. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem that I often encounter with the modern popular revival of these native dishes, namely the fact that the spirits are proving bad for no reason other than that expected! In addition, it does not bring much to the department of fears ?? a giant crab attack is just stupid? as ghosts usually inhabit a specific character and push him to act in a totally atypical manner, like Susan George, a seductive diplomat / family friend, Doug McClure and Edward Albert, thrusting with force! <br /> <br /> At some point, an old monk comes to the house to warn Albert of the danger if they stay there ?? finally, he is called to exorcise the place. However, history must be repeated and tragedy is the only result of the tense situation duly created ?? leading to a violent but unintentionally amusing climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to death! At the end of the day, it results in a waste of innocuous time ?? tolerable at only 88 minutes but, under no circumstances, essential visualization.
