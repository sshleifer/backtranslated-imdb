At first, it was a "cute" movie, and in the best case, it became too dark and had mediocre songs. <br /> <br /> There is too much talk of King James in English, which is not only annoying in today's world, easy to interpret. Can you imagine today's young people trying to listen to this film? Forget that. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is friendly as "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was also accompanied by her beautiful appearance and her beautiful and long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie with a happy ending, and I can not hit it. It may be worth a rental, for historical reasons or if you're a big fan of Crosby, but overall, it's not that bad.
