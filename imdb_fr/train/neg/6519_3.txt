Filmed in a documentary style, but you can say that the participants were coached. A recently divorced young filmmaker (Myles Berkowitz) sees an opportunity to animate his love life and to enter the world of cinema at the same time. He intends to make a documentary about finding love by filming twenty dates, including ramifications. Comedy is at best unequal; the rest is incident after incident. Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the attractive Elisabeth Wagner will also participate. In search of credibility, the chore Tia Carrere will make its appearance. This will suffice as a manual explaining how NOT to get a satisfactory date.
