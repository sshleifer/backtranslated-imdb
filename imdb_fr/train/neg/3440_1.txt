never look at this movie ... it's the biggest pile of movies I've ever seen. and that's saying something. the acting, the scenario and the shooting were absolutely desolating, it is THE WORST WORLD FILM !!! seriously, does it not even give you a success as it cost me 99 pence of sainsburys and it was only made in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie, you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... although if you really want to watch it, you have to watch the "scary shark scene" ... maybe the best play I've seen in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously it's the biggest loss of 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
