The only thing scary about this movie is the thought that whoever created it could do a sequel. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, "The Tooth Fairy" was downright horrible. It looked like a misinterpreted children's movie that was getting confused, with a "Wizard of Oz" melting and a happy childhood ending with some effects of gore and swearing. <br /> <br /> Half of the distribution seems completely useless except to be easily there to be murdered in a certain way. The brothers' sister, Cherise, the aura reader, and Mrs. McDonald make absolutely no sense in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for interesting stories but could not seem to be bothered. People who watch the movie know that the characters are there for a bloody death scene, but go, at least, TRY and have a slight plot for them. The story in general is weak with an erratic behavior of the characters that makes you wish they were all eaten by the witch. <br /> <br /> Add the weak scenario and the weak ones acting together (the children are especially made of wood) and the film finishes a complete failure. If only MST3K could have tried this one ...
