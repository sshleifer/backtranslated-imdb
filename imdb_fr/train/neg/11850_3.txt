Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a bit of humor to his characterization. They form a nice team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but the resulting film is very dull. The opening and closing are surprising. The highlight is a summary of the plot's development points. <br /> <br /> *** A Cry in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark
