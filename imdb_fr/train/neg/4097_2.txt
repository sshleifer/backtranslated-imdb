The bad news is that it's still really terrible. I gave him a 2 because from time to time some of this parody of kitchy briefs actually looks funny. <br /> <br /> She is supposed to be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker" and the progress has to be rewarded. Or maybe I drank a lot when I looked at him and felt generous. Anyway, "2" that's it. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty quickly. It takes elements of most of Kill Bill I & II's key themes and fight scenes, hacks them, makes them dumb, messes up the dialogue, and messes up about an hour of really horrible amateur video. <br /> <br /> You'd better smoke a lot of powerful thing if you want to enjoy this one. And bring that DVD back to the video store on time! You will really hate yourself if you have to pay late fees.
