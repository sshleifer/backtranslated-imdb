This film was supposed to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The game was terrible, horrible and nerdy and speaks of a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again and I will not recommend it to anyone. What a waste of time! First of all, as soon as the film started, I realized what I was doing. All they did for this movie was copying scenes from many other horror movies and grouping them together in this movie. The stuffing phone calls, the halloween night, a psychopath and a knife! It's absolutely ridiculous. I was not afraid at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. When it comes to filming, it's rather hilarious to see how they tell how terrific and scary it was. I mean, how not to realize that the movie is a cheap scam of "Scary Movie" for example. Get at least some good actors and maybe it would have been a good horror movie.
