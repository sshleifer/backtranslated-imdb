Not the greatest Paul Naschy movie to remember. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I have ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came because the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> This film is described as an adventure and a horror. Forget the horror - there is none. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be king. <br /> <br /> The film mainly turned to Graciela Nilson, who only made four films in two years and disappeared from our regrettable loss. Where has she gone?
