I am very surprised to see such a high score for this film and for the few criticisms that there are to be positive. I saw the movie and I was pretty disappointed. I did not find it very nice at all. It was slow, and lacks entertainment value. Even the scenes of murder are dull, with real close-ups of generic stabs that do not look good at all. And the supposed good end is really not big, I saw it happen, then the end seemed just clich√©. This film may not have much mention, but it is overestimated by the little it receives. I would not recommend this movie.
