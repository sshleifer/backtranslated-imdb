This film abandoned by God tells the story of three stupid millionaires who gather a group of people to play a deadly game. The winner wins a million dollars. First of all, the acting is terrible and the film has absolutely no meaning. It's not at all scary, it's so stupid that it made me laugh, which is why it earned a single star. The film is not violent at all, but is rather sordid and focuses mainly on women's breasts all the time. , and some characters are very annoying and moaning. Moreover, the monsters of this movie are so fake and fake, and are not scary, which makes you want to throw something on the screen. Last but not least, the end is terrible. I do not want to give it, in case you're strange enough to see this piece of junk. AVOID ANY PRICE !!!!! <br /> <br /> Uncategorized (but should be R) for nudity, profanity and Mild Gore.
