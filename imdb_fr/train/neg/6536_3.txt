This DVD seems to be for someone who will put it and read it in an endless loop in the background. It's organized as a series of Grand Canyon music videos on various pieces of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TD's music is dull and the transfer to DVD is rather blurry and dark. Too expensive a DVD for what it is.
