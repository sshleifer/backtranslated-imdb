Losing Control is another offer in the erotic thriller genre that could be considered the pulp fiction of the film world. Usually, they involve a backdoor route leading to murderous intent, interspersed with copious undressing work. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by women of amazing beauty who invariably inhabit this imaginary world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers a blockage from a writer. It's by chance (or is it?) That she meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages with her in sex more and more risky. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim firmly refuses to terminate the case. His agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks it will do wonders for his book sales. As in most films of this type, the outcome is coming to an end, but some things do not match. I've seen enough of this kind of movie to think, so no change - but I like them. They are so little demanding. <br /> <br /> The casting performances vary. Doug Jeffery is wearing the movie as a psychopath / sociopath that you do not want to go through. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince the woman at risk. Clay Greenbush as PI did not convince either. <br /> <br /> Finally, a warning about the DVD being reviewed. The cover and the disc both indicate a 93-minute life, but the operating time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes seem truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is interrupted just as she begins. 4 stars.
