Herbie, the Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, led by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become NASCAR champion. The only champion on her way is current champion Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do everything in her power to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love bug was not so good. Even as a child, I remember not having loved him very much. I had some hope for the future however. I mean, the cast is pretty good and the trailer looks like it's a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better than he was before. The movie is pretty weak for people over 12 years old. He will probably entertain the kids, but that's it. <br /> <br /> I realize it's a children's movie and they could all have made the movie a little more interesting. . There was very little laughter and it became boring towards the end. Most of the actors also seemed dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was fine like Maggie Peyton. It usually gives better performances as in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance among everyone. He was very good as a villain, even though he did not have much work with him. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and do not do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson directs and does a good job. She tries to keep the movie interesting but she works with a weak scenario. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would you be surprised to find that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two movies make light movies, but they fail to make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not completely their fault, but I hope next time they will do their best. In the end, Herbie is a safe and predictable family film that deserves to be watched if you're a kid. Everyone has an interest in skipping it. Note 4/10
