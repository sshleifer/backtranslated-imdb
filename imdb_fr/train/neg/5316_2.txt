Throw a bone at this lame dog. Sooo bad ... you can still watch. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic villain who escapes being sprayed by an overzealous spaceship commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a shuttle crashing on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the dead or living villain. John Phillip Law plays a ranger / park who calls for caution against these two visitors from far away. The costumes are outrageous and the script lacks intelligence. Vincent surely took the money and ran. The law is the only sign of effort. Too bad he's almost comical. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
