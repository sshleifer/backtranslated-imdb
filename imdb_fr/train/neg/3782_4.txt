Here is the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually stunning animated film of the current version of home theater. The illustrations and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend you give this film a visual only visual appearance. <br /> <br /> And now, the bad news. I really think so when I say that animation is the only thing that matters for this movie. You may remember that "the Spirit" was mistreated by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who says it's because Disney is more established and has better publicity can write me a four-page essay titled "Why did not the Lilo and Stitch script stink"? <br /> <br /> Despite the incredible new animation technology presented in "Spirit", the story is almost * surprisingly * dull. There is a lesson here, and (needless to say), this does not apply only to animation movies. You can have the most breathtaking visual effects that have ever been in the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we make fun of your characters, it's a bad achievement. As simple as that. The animation is always breathtaking. I can not wait to see what someone with more imagination is doing.
