I read the book a long time ago and I do not specifically remember the plot, but remember that I enjoyed it. Since I'm sick home on the couch, it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It's a movie for life. <br /> <br /> The film is populated by actors and actresses of grade B. <br /> <br /> The female distribution comes from Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show, but there are many commercials for the show and I understand the basics. Is there nothing original anymore? Of course, but not on all of life. <br /> <br /> The male actors are all pretty effeminate, but the girls must have a husband, I suppose. <br /> <br /> In a scene, a woman struggles with a man, for his life, and what does she do ??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women like that, but let me tell you something, girls ... It's not as easy as it always looks. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad. I've had chills once or twice so I have to credit someone with that.
