Probably one of the craziest slasher films of all time, misinterpreted and poorly written. <br /> <br /> THE INITIATIVE Five students stayed behind during the holiday season closing a dormitory, but someone has plans and starts killing him. by one, the main suspect is the terrifying gardener John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or could it be one of the five characters. <br /> <br /> ACTING Not so bad not so well besides Daphne Zungia who dies too fast and should have been the main heroine, and the rest boring though Laura Lapinski, the main heroine, sometimes has its charm and you feel sorry for it in the end. <br /> <br /> THE KILLS Can not really see why they banned that, the dead usually look fake, a guy has his hand cut in half at the beginning that really looks fake, but the others are pretty mean as a girl gets run over by a car, a girl is boiled alive and another burned alive. <br /> <br /> GLOBAL Not really a super slasher neck ld have been much better
