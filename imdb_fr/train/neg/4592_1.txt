This film made me very angry. I desperately wanted to strangle the "scientists" and the invisible filmmakers. Very, very painful to sit down. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst case. The little valuable information on chemistry and brain function and quantum theory is lost in a sea of ​​older horses. The worst offenders were crack quilts Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead a life of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, lives at a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes with which I fundamentally agree are presented in a manner so heavy, awkward, superior, pretentious and predatory that I have felt the desire to disavow them. I think that's what made me so angry, the fact that they took what is really profound aspects of established scientific thought and branded them with their new age hokum. Much of it is based on the mistake of applying the concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Appropriately, the dramatized parts of Marlee Matlin are amateurs and clichés. <br /> <br /> I refer people to Bill Bryson's excellent scientific study: "A brief history of almost everything". Current and well-established science is full of profound wonders about life and the universe.
