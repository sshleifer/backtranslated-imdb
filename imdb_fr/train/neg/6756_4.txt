Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name of the legendary Full Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, his arrival in this independent studio took place at a time when production and budget values ​​are at their lowest in years. However, during his short career, Hamilton has established himself as a creative director who manages to create inventive and original stories. Now, that does not mean that his films are good, but at least they are different from those of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In his debut, "Bleed", Hamilton presents a creative touch. the sub-genre slasher. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets the job of her dreams. Not only that, but it seems that she also found a boyfriend in Shaun (Danny Wolske), it seems that life finally smiled for Maddy after many sad events. Until a party with Shaun's friends, they tell him that they have created a "club" where members must kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> Of course, they're joking, but Maddy desperately wants to fit in, that she's actually killing someone. After this event, someone starts to kill the rest of the "club" members one by one. It's up to Maddy to determine what's going on, because everyone could be the killer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character, beautifully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. This is a very interesting twist on the genre of having the main actress among the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good that it's a shame that Hamilton did not develop the story a bit better. The film is sometimes very slow and overall, it's the idea of ​​a good idea spoiled for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strange in the sense that all women are very good. , while the male cast is painfully bad. Danny Wolske is terribly wood and his performance as yuppie is quite stereotyped. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. In addition, there is a lot of nudity (men and women) and the distribution is very beautiful, so it's really an advantage. <br /> <br /> The small budget hurts the film in the effects department, because there are very few bloody scenes and are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); Nevertheless, given the budget, the film has at least a beautiful appearance. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's most recent effort, the "Delta Delta Die!" sex business, is a more elaborate and entertaining film. Although this one is not as bad as other more well-known movies, it still has a lot of flaws and may only be interesting for Debbie Rochon fans or independent film fans without a budget. 4/10
