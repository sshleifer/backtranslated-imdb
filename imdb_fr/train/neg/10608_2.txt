I do not think any Van Damme movie will ever beat Universal Soldier but you never know. This film was good but not as good as the 1st. VD returns a Luc & has to fight again. He tries 2b funny here but it's worth a smirk. VD has a child of Ally W. this time, well. He showed a picture. 2. Goldberg was cool, he made his famous move. He forgot what it's called because I do not watch the fight, it sucks. VD & Goldberg have had good fights. It was the end as the first but it was not so good. VD is doing his best in his career, as always, HELICOPTER KICK. Even so, the final end should have been longer. Anyway, it's worth visiting, but it will never go beyond the original.
