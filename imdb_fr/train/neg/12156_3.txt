Jesus Christ, I can not believe that I lost my time watching this movie. I only watched because I have a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost upset me. It is absolutely awful! I could have watched Survivor Series 93 about it. <br /> <br /> The main type of this movie was so bland and generic. I would love that the big Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove "runs his ass through a window." I was furious every time he said "lake" and "cabin". I would give him a good kick. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely great. A real angel. But she could not even save that joke from a movie. Unfortunately, she could not even act like she was crazy when she took this drug truth. It was hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also loved the moment Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. It reminded me of a time when ... so much the worse. <br /> <br /> You can still watch this movie because of its horror.
