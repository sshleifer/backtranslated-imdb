This film could have been very good, but is very short. Cheesy special effects and so-so act. I could have looked beyond that if the story was not so ugly. If there was more than one background story, it would have been better. The plot is centered on a druid witch who is related to this woman who suffers from migraines. The film hangs out again and again and never explains anything, it continues to walk. Christopher Walken has a role, but he is completely insane, like most movies. This film had potential, but it looks like a very bad TV movie. I would like to avoid this movie.
