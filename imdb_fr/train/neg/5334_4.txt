After a few years of skinny cows, Elvis had a rough time in 1968: not only did he make this special "Comeback" TV show, but he also became a father and starred in two rather decent movies ?? SPEED AND LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A SMALL. Therefore, personally, I can forgive him for the misstep of STAY AWAY, JOE who, at best, appears as an interesting miss and not so bad at all. Of course, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing ?? like an Indian father worthy of the Elvis character and a silly bartender who also watches Mr. Presley - but we're glad to see Elvis surrounded by Hollywood's seasoned talent, like Katy Jurado (the Mexican wife of Meredith), the two Jones ?? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez who is particularly amusing as Thundercloud's sarcastic leader and Meredith's stubborn father who still wears his old chef clothes! <br /> <br /> While there is a surprising lack (if it's not a mistake, given their usual blandness) of songs, there does not seem to be a shortage of free spins for all, where the Indians males went to the bottle while Presley her female talents behind her back! As you might expect, the typically "western" landscape of Arizona is a major asset here and the sleepy sleepy, the gore-bull is not only a good asset, but also an important part of the plot. On the other hand, the culminating episode of "destruction of the house" is the one we have seen too often since and which does not work very well here ...
