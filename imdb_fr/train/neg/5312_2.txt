Director Fred Olen Ray said the film featured a cyborg hunter (Teagan) commissioned by goalkeeper Jan-Michael Vincent to track down and execute the escaped extraterrestrial convict, Ross Hagen, who paved the way for the Earth. Soon, ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of odiously hamy college kids led by the Richard Wiley network who came across Hagen with his motorhome during a camping trip that went wrong. Soon, the cyborg will explain with his laser-burning arm an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of Count Yorga-Vampire) proving that no one will oppose his task to recover the skin of the convict, whose collar is a device of tracing that weakens his body. The law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, a veteran of the war against Vietnam with weapons far too hidden in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps intentionally made horrible, this film presents what fans of "rancid cinema" aspire ... extraordinary. effects, acting and premise. At least, the film has PJ Soles as a candy for the eyes ... even in 89, she was very smoking. This laser gun is funny, it can possibly cremate houses. Yet, when the Cyborg shoots Law, it barely leaves a mark on the shot location.
