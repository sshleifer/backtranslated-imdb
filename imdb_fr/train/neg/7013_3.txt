Unfortunately, this movie, 54 was a pathetic attempt at the true story of 'Studio 54'. The only thing that was good about the picture was "Mike Myers" which was a joy to watch. "Neve Cambpell" even though his role was small was unfortunately bad. The bottom line is that this film lacks a good performance from the actors, except for one, and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good storyline.
