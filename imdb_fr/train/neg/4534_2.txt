The book on which this film is based has seriously changed my life. But to say that this film was a disappointment is a euphemism. The acting, the staging, the cinematography and the screenplay were all horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I have talked to countless people about the book, but now I will tell everyone that they should not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book to the letter, but they left out too many key elements of the book. The film tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only softened the central theme of the prophecy. While putting myself in the position of who had not read the book, I saw Celestine's prophecy as a group of hoaxy B.S. I am really disappointed with Redfield for the turn of this movie.
