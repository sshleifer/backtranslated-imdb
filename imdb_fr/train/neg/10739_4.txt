Iedereen Beroemd has all that one can expect from a video film. This is the story of a man who believes that his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and journalists. A simple plan for which he must kidnap and blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot, but how it is done. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it's not. It's trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow and the final sequence is totally without culmination or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you want to laugh, but only how all the configuration is pathetic.
