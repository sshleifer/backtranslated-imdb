Jason Lee's pecks are back! If that's what you're looking for, look no further. Otherwise, it's better to move on ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s galore, scenes of poorly shot fights but a little exotic (with JKD used) and a lot of bad effects of actors and cheap. Poor Lee seems to be hurting all the way through the movie, and no wonder. It's not a pleasant return. <br /> <br /> The film does not even cut it like a serial movie. Of course, there was a wicked blond German blond, Rutger-wannabe, but no free sex scene or even single. loot. No. Zip *: French. Nada. Even in Starship Troopers 2, they had the good sense to include compulsory nudity scenes (for the rest of my comments on this excellent classic film of excellence, refer to our next article on this amazing sequel ...) . I had the feeling that the writer was taking revenge on someone with that - so I'm not going to get into the "plot" of the movie or just about anything related. Except he had non-heterosexual connotations, Nuff said. <br /> <br /> However, this film has a purpose - not Jean-Claude :)
