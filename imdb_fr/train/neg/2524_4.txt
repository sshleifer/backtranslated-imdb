Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Singer: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Critic: Stuart Gordon that we usually associate with extremely bloody horror films such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, made a little detour here and made a little sci-fi movie. I insist on the word "little" because it is a film with very low budget and that is its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (which, according to this film, are the United States and Russia) solve their differences not by engaging in a brilliant world war ... but by engaging in gladiatorial battles with gigantic robots. Our hero Achilles has to face the evil Russian robot hunter called Alexander. The result is a cheap stop motion animation. <br /> <br /> The idea is great, I suppose. The big nations settling territorial conflicts with giant robots? An interesting premise that could have been managed properly if the appropriate budget had been available. Unfortunately, what could have been a fun movie ends up being embarrassing for an otherwise great director. <br /> <br /> Me, child, I liked this film and I suppose that if you want this film gives you pleasure, you 'll have to go back to the little child mode to have a little fun with . I showed this film to some of my friends and as the film progressed, my friends would say, "What is this piece of shit franco?" And I feel good that this film is a science fiction of one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon? "But as the film progressed on a wasteland, I felt almost like a pressure not to be subjected to this torture, I could get through because I loved this film like a kid and that there is still a little nostalgia to watch it, but everyone was not going to get it. <br /> <br /> And myself, I realized that the film was not good. First, the movie is about giant robots that run away from each other, and to do it credibly, you'd have to use great special effects to make it work, expensive effects. disbelief, but unfortunately it's a small-scale film, created by a small company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after shooting this movie!), but whose effects only help us to laugh and to laugh at it .. sets and some of the wardrobe seems unfinished or half assed. <br /> <br /> OK That said, once you accept the fact that you're watching a mix of moderate animations with stops and thumbnails, you can somehow give in to the movie and even appreciate the big robots who run away from each other. There are some scenes where the robots are fighting that are pretty cool and that made me leave "that's why I liked this movie!" But every person and every one of them know it, a crappy effect will come out of this protective little cocoon in which you tried to hide yourself. And boom, your return in the realization of this film simply does not correspond to its principles. <br /> <br /> And here's another thing that a little bit embarrassed me in the movie. This film is basically a movie for kids. You know, giant robots handling all this? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this movie dialogue has had a lot of sexual savants and the violence is getting a little bloody. So I wondered if it was a children's movie or not? After a while, I just concluded that it was actually a children's movie with a sensitivity for adults, which is really not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those who do not feel naive childish charm of watching two robots fight and if you do not have a nostalgic connection with this movie (as I do), I suggest you you stray from it. Gordons is an excellent director, but this film he did just did not do it for me. At least, not now that I am an adult adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
