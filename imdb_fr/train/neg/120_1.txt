When I first saw this film, I quickly noticed the actress playing Lucille Ball. Lucy's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was a stunning actress with incredible talent. Thinking of a legend such as Lucille Ball, as she was portrayed in the film, is horrible. I can not believe, among all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to take Rachel York. She could be a good actress in other roles but playing the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It's pretty hard to find someone who might look like Lucille Ball, but he could at least find someone similar in appearance and talent. If you've noticed the role played by York in Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate shop or the vitavetavegamin, nothing is the same - her expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino can not play as Ricky. He is small and skinny, his accent is unreal and, again, his playing is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel are not alike either, they were not as bad as Lucy and Ricky's characters. <br /> <br /> Overall, the cast is extremely horrible and the story is poorly told. If people want to understand the real situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A & E Biography by Lucy and Desi, reading the book by Lucille Ball herself or American Masters: Finding Lucy of PBS. If you want to see a documentary, "Before laughter" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the laughter" is much better compared to that. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
