I was expecting a little something of "K-911", I mean it looked like a cute movie I could enter. I have always loved dog comedy movies. But it seemed like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was rather lame and the two amorous interests did not really have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a totally sexist vision in the film despite the fact that the author was not going in that direction. James really made me angry for more than half of the movie. The dogs were the real stars and it's pretty sad that they shone to the actors. <br /> <br /> So I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb that agrees it was a pretty stupid movie. But if all goes well, James will realize that it is his brother Jim who was the talented, without wishing to offend anyone, but not everyone can be their star brother. You would not want Ashlee Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
