To be brutally honest ... I loved watching Severed. That's why I assigned it <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars because of its absolutely amazing story <br /> <br /> / filming / acting / acting all. This film was a movie to watch. If you like to watch bad movies to make fun of them, <br /> <br /> you'll really get a kick from Severed. <br /> <br /> The story really does not matter, it involves a guy who is bald <br /> <br /> and who has a sword and will decapitate people at random. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural twist ... no one ever sees him doing it. <br /> <br /> Even when, in a memorable scene, he enters a nightclub <br /> <br /> jampacked and removes a girl noodle and <br /> no one sees it. <br /> <br /> Coup√© does not just appear to have been filmed on video, it was filmed on someone's camcorder. Filmmakers had <br /> <br /> knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition <br /> <br /> in certain scenes. But most of all, you can not hear the actors ... you can not understand what they are doing, and you laugh <br /> <br /> when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin in detail of his body. <br /> <br /> Go rent this movie. Support movies like this: they are funny and <br /> hollar!
