My roommate recorded the soundtrack of No, No, Nanette on a tape and listened to it continuously. After that it completely washed my brain, I found the songs irresistible, especially the famous ones, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... was about. So the other day, I saw a copy at the video store and I praised what was supposed to be a lost version of the movie. I thought it was going to be great, because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved were not found in the video I watched. Now, I've never seen the 1930 version of the musical, but this version was unfortunately disappointing because there were very few songs and practically no dance, and beside that, the sound was really bad and we did not could not really understand a lot of time. The only highlights of this film were the scandalous fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stand out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this weird feather sleeve that she keeps on her front arm and that it is then wrapped in this net scarf. The dance sequence is a bit strange also with Nanette doing this weird ballet thing with pin-up pictures superimposed on her. The artist Guillespe, who dreams of becoming a beautiful artist, is another brilliant element of the film. He is currently condemned to attract pin-ups for money. I like the way Guillespe keeps his old school and dissects Nanette when his masterpiece, the piece that was to make his career, is sold by Nanette for a meager $ 5,250. Does not she realize that this piece was her immortality? Bunny / stupid girl with your feather bunny ears on your hat. When will you learn? Why does not he just make a cigarette in pencil before the men of the pub remove the work?
