Wow, I love and respect just about everything David Lynch has done. However, this film is similar to the attempt of a first filmmaker to make a pseudo-video art. <br /> <br /> To give you some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is usually a filmmaker in visual arts. However, its artistic content is not very visual (blank walls, "shots" with ceiling in the background) <br /> 2. David Lynch is generally very proud of the audio, but you can even hear the buzz of the video camera . <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the idea that it has nothing to do with this movie. Unless ... <br /> <br /> ... it's a joke, on David's part, to force fans to search his website (for hours) for the sole purpose of finding that drivel. I hope so, because at least this idea is funny.
