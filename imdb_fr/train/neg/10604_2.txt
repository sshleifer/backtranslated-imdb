This time, the hero of the first film became human and this time uses combos of fists and feet against super universal soldiers and a computer that went wrong and is ready to conquer the world. I'm pretty sure it was Double Team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible by offering action movies to watch. However, that is what has tarnished his credibility forever. Although Universal Soldier: The Return is not as dull as Double Team or The Quest, it is still awful, without the style and style of the original and no star association. This suite is made just for kids who love professional wrestling. Looking back, even the action sequences were not so exciting and therefore, this movie is a worthless misfire. In other words, another clunker in the assembly line of Van Damme. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
