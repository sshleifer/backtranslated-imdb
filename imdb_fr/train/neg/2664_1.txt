A poignant and clich√© thriller starring a young couple doing research across the country at the most infamous killing sites in the United States, and becoming a partner on the road with a bright-minded young woman and her Surly boyfriend - a real psychopath. Arty and alienating, the tone of the film alternates between silly pseudo-irony and stupid flamboyance. Well done maybe, but finally laughable. Brad Pitt's performance as a low-rent killer is divine. * from ****
