Sean Bean is great, as is photography, places and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat confusing and the conclusion is flat. The plot has been substantially altered from Cornwell's novel, not at best. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched. Sharpe was too narrowly drawn here, unlike his literary alter ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension about his new role as a promoted officer in the ranks. I really enjoyed the brief scene in which Sharpe is triggered by a "real" officer and, after a short pause and piercing gaze, repels the surprised and intimidated officer. This sets the tone for his subsequent trials as a commander. <br /> <br /> Note: "4" on "10".
