Really, really, abysmal, screaming, awful. But actor Clayton Moore (the movie Lone Ranger) performs competently as an actor. He is the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to dive into the depths of special effects of a grotesque transparency, Southern California as "the moon" (again and again), and acting so ineptly that it could be a parody. . . except that it is clear that this is not the case - no humor here, except involuntarily. <br /> <br /> The dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects and costumes. . . Well, enough said. Ground? What intrigue? A villain (well, a bad guy in chief) and his henchmen, including his ground agent called Krog (listen well or you suspect it's a spoof of the name of McDonald's founder, Ray Kroc) and his incredible incompetent pistols (who, however, have handguns that never need to be reloaded, like Commando Cody, so there are many oppositions for firefighting). <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
