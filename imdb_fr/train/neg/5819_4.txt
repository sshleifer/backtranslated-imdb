This is the story of a dysfunctional Jewish family. The parents divorced and mom stays east in the house. The father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California and travels to Beverly Hills so his children can have the best education possible. <br /> <br /> Things get really funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, comes along with the band. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the various adventures of the family, complicated by the addiction scene in the prosperous neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter, a woman looking for Murray to move in with her because she wants a mate. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno enter the end. They play respectively Murray's brother and sister-in-law; they are also Tomei's parents. In front of the children, Reiner releases the gesture by reminding Murray that he has always paid the bills. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a bitter note as the embarrassed family comes out of their digs to take a drive around Beverly Hills. I guess the film promotes independence and good old self-esteem.
