Nicole Eggert has been named as the star of this film, despite the fact that Micheal Dorn and Stacey Keach are much bigger than her. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a little spin-off of the movie "Alien land on Earth". Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an Alien pursued by the army and welcomes the fugitive creature in his sexy costume. A bit of nudity and partial nudity, a useless sex scene, all along the way. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles through some obvious scenery and jokes about being shown photos. I liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was picked up and had a really cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be taken over and that the film had a final In conclusion, it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien had conveyed to Eggert.
