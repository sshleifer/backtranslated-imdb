In the following of the mini-series entitled Tower of Babel, the narrator describes his builders as "the descendants of Moses". <br /> <br /> It's like saying that George Washington lived several centuries before Alexander the Great. <br /> Or that the bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was the precursor of the bow and the arrow. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> The writers of the Greatest Heroes of the Bible should have at least been more attentive to chronologies of characters and biblical events.
