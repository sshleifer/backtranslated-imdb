It's one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the acting was all over. I'm not sure this movie is the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played as such. It does not even particularly succeed in its central design of trying to appear as a single continuous plug. The horizontal pans of cameras are an inexpensive and unoriginal way to hide the cuts.
