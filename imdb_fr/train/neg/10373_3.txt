This is one of those movies that I could only watch once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the players are fine. The problem was in the script, dialogue, direction, editing, sets and special effects. Yes, it was in 1933, but it really cracked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W. C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (their faces demanded recognition was not imminent). The film has just clung together without cohesion. Much of the spirit, humor and continuity Lewis Carrols lacking. What a pity! It's such a good book. I would recommend the 1951 version of Disney.
