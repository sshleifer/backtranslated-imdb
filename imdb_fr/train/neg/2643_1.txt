This, for lack of a better term, the film is zero. Where should I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This is perhaps the worst I've seen this year. It looked like the camera had gone from cameraman to cameraman. Maybe they only had one camera. It gives you the feeling of being a volley ball. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes, taken at random, projected without any continuity. When they did the split screen, it was absurd. Everything was flat, it looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The color tones were very bad. These people must learn to balance a camera. This "film" is badly done and badly done. <br /> <br /> The plot - You're kidding. If I were an SS officer, I would sue the producers. looked like the Marks Brothers with radios and pistols. Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see him for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less and a lot more. As a bimbo of action, she was not much. <br /> <br /> I could not see a real conspiracy, apart from the fact that Douglas fuck the woman to the president. Never said why the mercenaries were trying to kill the near. I just do not see the president of the United States rushing into the tunnels of a building, like a rat in a labyrinth. p-l-e-a-s-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This film is the proof. I like "the big screen". I have since my childhood. Many other "movies" like this one and I will stop going there. What is the Hollywood problem, do so many chick films, forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I would start using old movies. The one with real actors, good stories - and a good Cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> This "film" is a dog. Do not waste your time and money on it. I note this film a zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look over his age, but his age is too difficult to succeed.
