"Phantasm" from 1979 was a very atmospheric horror movie, scary, scary and very original, and, in a word, cult. The first sequel of 1988 was bloody, witty, full of activities and very entertaining. After the first sequel however, the creator of "Phantasm", Don Coscarelly, seemed to lack new ideas. "1994's Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" is certainly not a total failure, it's even very entertaining, but there's no originality, and desperate attempts to bring something new are sometimes tedious, which makes them quite boring. disappointing compared to his predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> At the very beginning, we discover the secret that lies behind the mysterious sentinel spheres (the flying silver balls that suck the brain) is unveiled. Since then, a number of useless new characters and annoying (like Tim, a little boy of style "Home Alone" who is doing very well in filming, a Rocky, a black chick at the same time robust and super cool with a nunchaku which swing) are presented. The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is once again very cool playing the ponytail, Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still pretty terrifying like the big man, but the fact that the big man talks a lot more in this movie makes him lose some of his goosebumps. The character of Mike is again played by A. Michael Baldwin (he was replaced by James LeGros in the second part), which, in my opinion, makes little difference. The film also keeps the film interesting enough to watch, but remains disappointing, especially because attempts to catch up on lack of ideas get upset pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Phantasm III" is a waste of acceptable time, but it is certainly disappointing compared to its predecessors. The fans of the first two films "Phantasm" can try it, but I recommend you do not set your expectations too high.
