SAKURA KILLERS (1+ of 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this film would have seemed cool ... if you had never seen a * good * ninja movie. A music of the 80s ... a nerdy dialogue ... a theatrical action ... and martial arts sequences well beyond the cheese. The coolest scene is the beginning ... with an old Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach ... many dressed black ninjas try to join him furtively and it looks like he's too determined to hit his ball for the notice ... Suddenly, he puts his hand in his golf bag and ... no, I will not spoil him ... if you have the misfortune to see this film, you will thank me. The story tells a lot of nonsense about a stolen videotape or something like that. A group of Caucasian Caucasian heroes are trained in the same way as the ninja, because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something of the sort. Strange, these guys do not seem to fight better after their training than before ... Oh, the film is moving fast enough. The fight scenes may not be great .. but there are many ... and the excessive sound effects are good for some laughs.
