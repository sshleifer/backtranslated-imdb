This film is a good example of the destruction of a book in 109 minutes. With the exception of the names of the characters, the film is very similar to the book. A book full of strong Latin characters and they are, for the most part, represented by non-Latinos. There is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And removing a full generation is inexcusable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what to read!
