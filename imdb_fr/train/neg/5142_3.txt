After Chaplin directed one of his best films, Dough & Dynamite, he did one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in the cinema, Chaplin made about a third of his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of advertising, editing, gags, filming, etc. It takes place on a race track where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without paying. Mabel Normand is also present with her friend and Chaplin manages to get rid of his friends and those of Mabel. He then motioned Mabel in the gallery without any apparent effect on her behavior. There is a lot of slapstick here, but there is very little to recommend to this movie but watch Chaplin grow. The fingerprints I saw were very bad, which could have hurt his enjoyment. Charley Chase can be seen. * 4 stars.
