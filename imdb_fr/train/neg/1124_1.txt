The first film was the best in this film because it gave you the hope of seeing a passionate and well-crafted independent film. Damn this opening shot to fill me with hope. As the "film" progressed slowly and painfully, my thoughts were varied in relation to this "film": was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did actors have to PAY the director to be in this "film"? Did I validate my ticket at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie at the theater! That would be the only exception I would make about seeing a movie at home over a movie theater, because at home you can turn it off. Are there values ​​that buy back? Peter Lemongelli as a standard college "nerd" has had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Apart from that, this "film" has gone from an attempt at comedy to a family drama to a spiritual ascendancy. It did not succeed on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was really bad. His performance was the only comedy I found.
