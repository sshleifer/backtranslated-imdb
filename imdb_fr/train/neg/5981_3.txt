I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is there) and I must say I was not happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, the infographic was amazing, but the plot had to be slightly modified. Also, I think this movie would have done a lot better with more curses and blood, so it had been rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> This would certainly attract more people to see it -> teenagers. What would also attract more teenagers (especially teenage girls) would be a close-up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Even if the film had negative points, I always saw it and thought everything was fine!
