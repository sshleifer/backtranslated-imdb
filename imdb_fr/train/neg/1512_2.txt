A bad attempt at a "Seven" scam, with less than a second of acting, a terrible camera job, a half-cooked story and a pronounced aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yeah, the "sex offenders", they live next door and you're going to be raped, really. <br /> <br /> No surprises on the part of the vice-terminator, she acts as always - as convincing as a piece of wood. Richard Gere continues to slide lower and lower - and is about as low as Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The crazy-eyed singer is better when she died in bed; and even the wolf was under normal (though she was the best performer in the movie) - maybe they had fed him before the shots, or something else. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven", which had a high, but interesting) story, to which we could report more or less regardless of the country, this film seems to focus on an American obsession. If we do not make fun of "sex offenders" - and statistics show that lack of exercise and poor nutrition cause more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see or have sex. fear. <Br /> <br /> There are fetishes and snuff, but the blood is less than mediocre and fails both as an artistic means (because it's useless) and in blood, because this is not bloody enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this one.
