Blank Check is easily one of the worst movies of the 90s. The plot is completely useless; his shades of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really think that a 12-year-old playing the role of personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish anything in this movie, like buying a mansion for only $ 300,000. The notion, not to mention the bargain price, will only be believed by the most credulous viewers. Please, respect your intelligence and do not watch this horrible movie.
