From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. OK, this caught my attention. <br /> <br /> The creators of Shrek have also created Madagascar. Madagascar was half as bad as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now, Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> This means that Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all the special effects were extremely good, but the movie was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this film was for children. It is seriously impossible for adults to really like this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were a lot of jokes for adults. I bet kids will not understand jokes. <br /> <br /> Even so, I'm crying like this movie. <br /> <br /> I am completely disappointed. 4/10
