I agree with the very first comment: this film is really very bad. Despite the very large distribution of the B list, the cover of this film (for those who do not watch it on Comedy Central on a weekday, which is probably the only exhibition that this film will ever get) tries to blame at Dangerfield, but in reality it's just a pay check for every comedian of the 80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr? Check. The voice of Lisa Simpson? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only horrible film: double checking. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this movie is that it has been written so lazily with jokes already told. Nothing from this film outside of its existence is funny. You better watch the paint dry. This is a film that hangs out the old adage video: throw a star on the cover and you will have the money from the rental. . Considering that video rental days are changing, consider this one of the last examples of waste disposal. <br /> <br /> The only use of this film if you have difficulty falling asleep. It will take you there.
