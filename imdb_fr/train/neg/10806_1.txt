If you are a fan of very bad movies and you find it funny, you will do the great performance of Shaq. First of all, placing professional players in movies almost never works. Shaq must have been the worst actor I've ever seen alongside Dennis Rodman who also directed some bad movies. Anyway, this movie is so bad because of this hideous kid. I would give a zero but it's impossible.
