I suppose it's Jack's great ability to empathize that makes him a powerful performer, but empathy comes at a price like anything else: when he's surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and does little more than 'a. He is a joke as a mafia-hit-man (also because the party does not suit him at all because he is so extroverted) and the mere fact of grazing avoids making himself ridiculous in this. Kathleen Turner had a career far too long just being tall and blonde, because her acting ability is limited to what she does with her eyes, when she opens them big she is convinced that it's so sexy and Anjelica Huston is the same thing (granted interesting) in all, just like Robert Loggia. <br /> <br /> The film is a rough draft (and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script) of a gangster movie, with a cast that was probably only interested in the arrival at the party. faster (they have certainly gathered the party elite in this area). What, did they shoot in 1 day? Because that would be the only explanation.
