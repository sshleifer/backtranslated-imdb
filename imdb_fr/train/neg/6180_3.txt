I attended one of the premieres last night and I have the following comments: <br /> <br /> 1. It's not because you've made a ton of music videos that you're qualified to make movies. The film had a glut of persistent shots that made no sense, horrible angles and terrible lighting. The editing did not help this mess. When "Dixie" arrives late at the memorial service, her mother makes remarks about her hand, but you never know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot was promising, but the script was thin and full of holes the size of a Ford truck. We never understand what motivates characters, what is behind the conflicts they all have with each other, or how they solve them. Sixteen years of distance are erased in four days, apparently by magic. The deep conversations were ruined by stupid clichés. (In fact, the entire city was a big cliché of southern life.) Half of the audience groaned when Toby pulled "You had my blood flowing in your gurl veins" ... and we were treated to this. Tasteless line not once but twice! The revelations aroused yawning and the dramatic confessions were summarized as follows: "I was stupid and stubborn". <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was acceptable given the sinking of a scenario with which they had to work. Toby was dark and almost all the movie, but when he smiled and lit up, he was charming. It's a pity he did not have more time on the screen like that. Kelly Preston's chops are pretty rusty and it shows. Lindsay Haun has talent and it's certainly not her fault that the writers have made her character so unkind at first that you do not blame her father for not coming for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to do more of this film but still seemed more or less lost. (And indeed, their characters get lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you're a fan of Toby, you'll love the songs. But often, the film gave the impression that a scene had been forced in order to be able to present one of his songs - or the artists of his label. For example, the film's official love song is "Crash Here Tonight". You'd think it would play in a tender love scene, but no ... we hear about it for about 45 seconds as he goes to a memorial service. It was as if they said "well, you have to use this song somewhere". The song "Broken" is obsolete and the best thing to do is to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary ... a promising plot never fully develops and the film is horribly uneven as it attempts vehicle for Toby Keith's music and product placement for Ford Trucks. These are people who rebuild broken bridges but try to explain the power of music, but the story is so badly told that the two points are lost in this musical video invaded by vegetation. I love Toby and I really wanted to love "Broken Bridges", but the people he relied on to make this film dropped him and deserve one of his famous shoes you know where.
