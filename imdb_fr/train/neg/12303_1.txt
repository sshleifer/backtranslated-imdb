This film is so bad that it's good - in a funny and involuntary way. I could not stop looking at that, I was laughing so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except that it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, the wife of an oppressed preacher who craves for Luke (Corey Sevier), a mysterious and mysterious adept who is finally known to be in prison; The only thing Sevier is guilty of is doing wrong! Mind you, it's not worse than other actors. You have the feeling that the actors have no idea that they are in a really horrible movie; they play straight. All that concerns the film is bad: the acting, the scenario, the love scenes, the rhythm, the twists, the choice of the music. The culminating scenes are so ridiculous - first the shooting in the church, then the last words of Luke to Emily - I screamed with laughter. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that Luke did a lot of weightlifting and crouching in jail, and we see a lot of his shirtless. This is probably the highlight of the movie.
