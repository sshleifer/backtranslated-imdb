SciFi had a lot of bad luck making quality movies (like Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based on the epic Beowulf epic, but he differs so much (and offers so little in comparison) that television commercials could just as easily have been dubbed "Christopher Lambert's shitty film". I did not expect it to be as accurate as a full Hollywood production, but I did expect "artistic integrity" to not interfere with the actual story (even if a small change was brought to allow a two-hour storyboard to take place <br /> <br /> Does the director and the producers have an idea of ​​what they are doing (has research been done on this?). Of course not, as one could see from the huge horned helmets worn by Beowulf and his team (with the exception of the mullet boy) A major problem I had though was with the look of Grendel - if Beowulf is supposed to fight him, would not he have to be 16 meters tall and weigh 2 tons? "The segment of Grendel's death was also lacking at all levels, in my opinion, that of the epic was actually better than the crap invented in the scenario, for example: Grend el is supposed to have the arm ripped out of the socket by Beowulf ?? not cut to the forearm after being burned by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that weighs 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother, did they simply combine it with the dragon at the end of the epic where he died when he succumbed to his wounds? And honestly, what was this mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because its connection with the epic? do not do it, it does not really exist (except the names of characters). If you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) ?? although I do not recommend looking either.
