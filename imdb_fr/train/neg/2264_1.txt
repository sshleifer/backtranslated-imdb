Before starting this review, I must say that I was, I guess, a little curious about this movie .. However, I probably would not have seen that if I had not had a slightly crooked arm. <br /> <br /> In In my opinion, this film shows how human can be depraved. In my eyes, the worst thing about all this Springer phenomenon is not that kind of people who play the act of "Jerry Springer Show" (which in itself is blatantly blame), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives (yes, I guess that includes me .. to the extent that it's true). If we do not glorify this kind of behavior (at least some might say so), we may be subtly corrupting our minds and / or disengaging ourselves from this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soap box (somehow). Here is the skinny: the film has a rating R, and although it deserves only that (I watched some scenes, so I'm not quite sure), I feel that an NC-17 (tip of hat to another criticism) might be a little more appropriate for the huge sexual content (a cynic might say that the movie is only a great excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre, connecting stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of upset stereotypical blacks who will appear in different Springer shows. At the end of the film, the film suggests a certain resolution and a rhetoric of Springer on the need for us to see the real world (obviously seen through his show). I agree with him on this point: it is important to know how the world really is in order to be able to seek a positive change. That said, let me tell you that the world has a pretty bad look in a newspaper or in the news to find out, but do not pay a lot of money to support the kind of sensational and perhaps stereotypical titallition that Springer try to give us.
