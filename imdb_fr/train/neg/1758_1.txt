If you have not seen it yet, I invite you to go ahead, to walk in the park, do not waste your time. Neither the script nor the acting is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide which was the worst: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is highly questionable. I hope she can improve it over time. The scenario is simply amazing. An American cop defeated by American cops in Europe ?? The infamous Slav Mafiosi protected by only two handsome guys ??? An emotional art teacher at the head of a ruthless gang ??? A Spanish police officer more stupid than a bag of hammers ??? Leave me alone. However, there is only one positive aspect of this film: at least, production costs must be lower than those of "Ocean's 12", as insignificant as this one.
