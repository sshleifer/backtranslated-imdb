It's been a long time that I have not seen such a bad movie .. The acting is very average, the story is terribly boring and I'm running out of words as to the performance. It was completely original. Oh, and it's as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood, a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the TV show - where the hell are you?) understood everything - distribution accounted for 80% of reality - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career restart, I think it might never happen again with their resume! The scenario had the potential, but neither 80% of actors nor the director (who is an actor and should clearly stick to an actor) have succeeded. Fred Durst was the only one to look better than the others. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you plan to look at it, I strongly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what looks like a bad cinema.
