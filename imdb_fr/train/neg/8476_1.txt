this film was a horrible excuse for ... a movie. First of all, the casting could have been better; Katelyn, the main character was nothing like her mother on TV. <br /> <br /> too, the plot was pathedic. it was extremely cliché and predictable. the end was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I'm going to say about it) <br /> <br /> However, the nail in the bag was a scene where Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) was supposed to cry, but the girl could not cry on command! no tears ran down his face, just some incredible sobs. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she had the same false laugh as Hillary Muff on lizzie Maguire (sp?). That's when the movie went from not so good to just bad. it really seemed like she was acting. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was a bit of a mix of all the 1990's cliché kids movies that everyone was fed up with - only the worst! <br /> <br /> b / t / w, I was babysitting when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, you can love it if your 9 or less. ;)
