** SPOILERS ** Film slasher redheads that makes no sense with a killer wearing a black dress and wearing what looks like a Peter Lorre rubber mask. Early in the film, almost the very first scene, it was learned that the young Beth Morgan was in drug rehab after the murder of her boyfriend at Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> It has also been unveiled. this FBI agent Sacker (Jeff Conaway), who is obsessed with capturing the killer, his daughter was also murdered in Tennyson at the same time. By the time the film "Do you want to know a secret" is over, he has never explained what these two murders in Connecticut have to do with the Florida massacre of half a dozen collage a year later? other than the killer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, wore the same silly Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> During Spring Break in the Sunshine State, all six students spend their vacations in a beach house and, before they even realize it, they start getting thrown at a. Starting with Brad Clyton, a computer geek, Chad Allen, the murder even affected a considerable number of people who had nothing to do with the target student, including Gavin police chief Jack McGee, who been opened in slices. <br /> <br /> The masked killer keeps Beth for the end in this strange ceremony in a deserted church, in what looks like the Florida Everglades. He then reveals who he is and what his intentions are as meaningful as the film, none. Trying to scare his audience, all the film does is confuse it and confuse it with a number of not-so-convincing slasher scenes. The most effective victim, Oz Washington's Tom Jay Jones, survives at least three assassination attempts and ends up with Agent Sacker, the movie's hero. <br /> <br /> Oz also got a vicious cut to the foot, caused by a big splint of glass that almost cut him in half and crippled him, but he miraculously found himself later, having been arrested for a murder he did not commit, In fact, he had two other attempts with the killer with him, not so much as to have a slight limp in his walk! Does not that make any sense why Oz and Beth left on their own to catch the killer instead of calling the police, with a cell phone Oz had instead? <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend, who loses his head, in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also unconvincing, as are the two girls at the beach house. They end up with Beth Oz being the victim killers and then disappearing from sight! For a moment, you did not know if they had really been killed or whether it was a hallucination from Oz or the local police. Until the final scene shifted where they appeared in the church. <br /> <br /> We also have a glimpse of a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and behaving odiously trying to get it. with Hank as Beth enters without Hank and Tina noticing her. It seemed to upset Beth even more than her boyfriend who had been murdered at the beginning of the movie!
