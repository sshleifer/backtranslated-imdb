First of all, I am not American or Middle Eastern. Second, I do not have a religion. The closest thing to a religion I have is sport and cinema. From now on, I think I'd better provide a neutral and unbiased opinion. <br /> <br /> Most of these shorts are a complete shame. This dreadful event should be used to commemorate all those innocent people murdered by "some" barbarous and uncivilized fools. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were vain attempts to score various political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loach's segment. Of course, we are all sad that this guy had a difficult life in his country, but what does this have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two wrongs do not make a right ?! It does not matter! This film should include a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent accent between Chile and English. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disturbing segment is that of Youssef Chahine. It is obvious that he has problems of logic. He justified the killings due to the fact that America is a democracy and that some Americans have voted the politicians in power, so all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy real? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East is. some do not even know what religion is practiced there; and the majority do not know the real political issues behind the scenes. ### Mr. Chahine, if we all have these problems in the world, it's because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims in the twin towers came from all over the world. Assassinated firefighters, lifeguards, office workers, bystanders and air passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we are not allowed to live because "some" people think that everyone should choose a camp or a religion. We are perceived as a fair game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its own bombarded victims. Another filmmaker uses this event to advance his own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of "me, me, me". Sometimes it's other people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idrissa Ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political scorer. They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film denigrates the memory of the victims of "September 11, 2001."
