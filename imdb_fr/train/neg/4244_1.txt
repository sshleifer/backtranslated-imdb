Contrary to my principles, let me first draw a conclusion, because I have just seen this "art" and I am always under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and I would never bother to write a single word about it, if it was "44 Minutes" made me sick to dead, which rarely happens to me. Paying for it does not make me really better, just as the movie deserved the high rating of the user here. <br /> <br /> So, what's wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title - "44 Minutes". We first think about "15 minutes", which is actually a much better movie, but still as bad in my book, and both can be compared to a certain extent. But, coincidentally, the things they share are their worst features. Both present Oleg Taktarov, who, with his strong Russian accent, clearly meets the expectations and prejudices of the population. Its purpose is to appeal to the spirit of the cold war. Ah, are we missing the good old days? Now, I do not mean he's a bad actor, I'm not yet able to judge his true performance, but he's just not a real character here, he looks more like an archetype. How someone can still engage in such things is beyond my comprehension. We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. In the film, Taktarov explains to his companion that Romanians are not Germans and that they are in America is really laughable. Should we assume that the greatest desire of the miserable duo is to become "real" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there is the problem of the media. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed 44 minutes. Instead, he bores us with interviews throughout the film, as in a cheap TV show, trying to reinvent the wheel. In 15 minutes, the media issue is central. The point is presented so that a teacher speaks to an obtuse pupil, but it deserves a separate comment. We are now focusing on 44 minutes. So, I tried to identify the purpose of this film. What is it? Provide a good time for the public? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Represent violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the juvenile delinquent. So he must promote peace and understanding after all? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I only know that I did not appreciate anything. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit that I am a big fan. I was hoping it would be a good point, but I was wrong. It's not his fault though. <br /> <br /> As a final note, comparing "firepower" to "will" at the end of the movie was one of the worst phrases I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> In summary, on the scale 1-10, I give it a pure, unmixed 1.
