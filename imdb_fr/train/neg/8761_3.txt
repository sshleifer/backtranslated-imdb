My girlfriend is used to go to Blockbuster and choose movies that no one has ever heard of. Certainly, this has sometimes led to fun discoveries. Often, the best that can be said is that they are certainly running for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought home "The advice of a caterpillar". She was excited because the box said it was funny. Fortunately for us, propaganda on the cards never lies. <br /> <br /> This film was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies where, unless you're a pretentious and superficial person who likes to watch movies about yourself, you'll hate all the characters in the movie. Until the introduction of the beautiful character. Who the main pretentious and boring character will fall in love with and act in such a way that in the real world would drive everyone out. <br /> <br /> SOFT SPOILERS FROM HERE <br /> <br /> Thus, a group of pretentious and emotionally empty, insane artists swear love and succeed in their careers. They then meet a kind, intelligent, emotionally mature and affectionate character (an almost perfect guy). We then look at the woman, the boring and pretentious artist (in her thirties?) Panic as she falls in love. So she tries to escape the friendly, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she has had a big empty sex. She is rude to this man and does everything in his power to drive him away. In the real world, she would have had a lot of success. I certainly wanted to run away from her and I was not even in a relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although it's good that the man "fought for his love", I never wanted her to have it. (My girlfriend either) She did not deserve it. And, why am I wondering, did the director think that the "almost perfect guy" should be punished for having to win a relationship with her? When the artist asked the "almost perfect guy" to leave, we shouted at him to leave as well. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the movie is so boring, childish and stupid that you want her to fail. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was as pretentious as to be upset. As for the other characters, they were well played, morally bankrupt and annoying. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say that I laughed a few times in the film. Unfortunately, there was not much laughter until the last ten minutes or so. But by the time I had these bursts of laughter, I had prayed that the film would end too long. I needed to get those tasteless characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch people you hate fighting a love for people they do not deserve, then this is the movie for you.
