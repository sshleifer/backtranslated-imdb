I admit that I feel uncomfortable with ghost movies and that I sometimes like the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, you really have to be crazy for to be funny. 'Over Her Dead Body' seems to take life after life a little too seriously and, in my opinion, fails for almost every aspect I can think of. The story is completely incredible, of course, and did not convince me, neither in the comic register nor in the sentimental register. The choice of the main actresses was awful. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the ladies' taste of his character seems to need a major improvement because Eva Longoria seems too old for her, and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (sorry again). A romantic story without sufficient reason for love is due to a failure from the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they only had supporting roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies. Nothing to watch, nothing to remember.
