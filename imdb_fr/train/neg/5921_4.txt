What exactly happened during the 11th World War in New Zealand when US forces were present? <br /> <br /> This terrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to watch. Can you imagine Joan Fontaine, the older sister of Sandra Dee? Fountain was more like his mother. Even more funny is that Fontaine gets pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed such beautiful chemistry on screen 4 years later in "The Hustler", do not have scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington for a walk despite her marriage. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a widower and finds love with Paul Newman, a very submissive man. There's even romance for young Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> The photo does not make much sense. Are they trying to say that everything is right in love and in war? If they are, they have mismanaged their sale. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly resolved. This should have been done quickly for this terribly disappointing film of 1957.
