I was really hoping it would be a funny show, given all the hype and clever preview footage. And talking about hype, I even heard an interview from the creator of the show on BBC World Today - a show broadcast around the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show is not even close to broadcasting. All the jokes are obvious - the kind that looks pretty funny the first time you hear them, but after that seems lame - and they do not get any new treatment or turn. All characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - well - mediocre (I'm nice). This is the classic recipe from CBC - a recipe that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are Muslim, you must be stupid to believe in any of the white characters, and if you are white, you will be offended a little by the fact that almost all the white characters are described as being either sectarian, ignorant, or both. It's not that mocking whites is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in them. It's only a problem when it's not funny - as in this show. <br /> <br /> Canada is full of fun people - so many that we regularly export them to Hollywood. So, how is it that the producers of this program have not found one?
