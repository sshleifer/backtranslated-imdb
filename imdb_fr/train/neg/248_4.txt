When will the pain stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas carol. They keep making movies with the same story, jostling each other trying to make it better than the rest, but unfortunately they fail because it's not a good story. Moralist, old-fashioned, conservative, happy. As if people were learning. The many versions of this film prove that we do not do it.
