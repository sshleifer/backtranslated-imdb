This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this weekend, The Gravedancers being the first. Gravediggers were better. I can only guess by looking at that the production had to be quite limited. I'll admit that the story started early is interesting, but it ended up getting confused. We did not really have time to sympathize or understand the characters, which only made each of their erratic characteristics more annoying. I must mention that there was also some confusion with a 12-year-old boy acting as sheriff. The only reason I sat down for the whole movie was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out to be unattractive. It might have been helpful to get to know the family better, but they did not really look like a family. <br /> <br /> For me, this film is so amateur that I could not even see it on DVD. The four notes correspond to the initial potential that the story could have had. It was a jump for horrorfest.
