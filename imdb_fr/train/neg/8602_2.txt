All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten. Then they start rolling the credits of the title: You see "Slugs!" in large letters, followed shortly thereafter by "The Movie". PHEW! I was worried about accidentally listening to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". Anyway, from then on, the movie breaks down into a slaughter. You see a man cut his hand because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people are attacked by slugs while having sex and a girl who falls on his back in an underground passage is stung to death by killer slugs. It's a pretty stupid movie, falling into the category "so be it, too bad". It is also shot so badly with such a grainy film that you are shocked to learn that it was shot in 1988 (I guess it was in 1974). I am VERY surprised that she received a score as high as here, because most people here do not give any love to these types of films. But if you want a film that tries to be scary but ends up being laughable, it's one of your best candidates.
