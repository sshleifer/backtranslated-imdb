I really wanted to love this western, as a fan of the genre and fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", who are all in this story! Add to that Gary Cooper as a lead actor, and it sounded good. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I found myself watching my watch barely 40 minutes later, bored to death. The character of Jean Arthur was somewhat annoying and James Ellison just did not look like "Buffalo Bill". Cooper was not at his best, either, sounding too much wood. It was several years before he reached his peak as an actor. <br /> <br /> In a word, his occidental is a virgin. Climb the pass and watch another plane, as most of them were better than this one.
