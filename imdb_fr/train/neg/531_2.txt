With a distribution list like this, I was expecting a lot better. Venessa Redgrave spent the majority of the film in bed. The best actresses in the world can not create anything very interesting if their game is limited to falling asleep and falling asleep throughout the film. The summary of the plot says that a secret is revealed to girls as their mother approaches death. The fact is that she never says anything to her daughters except enigmatic advice to be happy. All the relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that going back and forth between the past and the present was useless. It seemed that the idea was stolen either from Da Vinci's The Code in which the device was used to increase the suspense, or from The Notebook in which they used it to create the endless novel of the main characters of the 'history. Anyway, it was a cheap camera in this movie because it did not work. It was a way to try suspense in a film that does not have any. I left wondering why good movies can not be written for women. It was really a disappointment.
