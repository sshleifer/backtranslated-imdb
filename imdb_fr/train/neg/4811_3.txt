I watched the Canadian videotape of this film as "The Witching" that sort of went to New York State. The audio was pretty bad, I had to go up to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often overflowed the dialogue. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialogues and others had passed into an echo chamber. A ghostly figure that constantly reappears in the distorted voice. Some subtitles would have really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of wizards or satanists (the ending credits indicate that the band was not supposed to represent a real group!) A ritual in which he undresses and miscarries stabbing a doll . The woman who had miscarriage and her husband moved to a town called "Lilith", where he was offered a job in a toy factory. Although one of the AKA of this film is apparently "The toy factory", we never see it and it is only mentioned from time to time. <br /> <br /> On her way to Lilith, her husband gets impatient with his questions about what his new boss, Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious beliefs. He drives aggressively and detonates another car. After the police arrive, she takes a doll that has fallen from the car, the second of many dolls handmade in the film. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr Cato and all the townspeople are wizards and they are the ones who caused his miscarriage, although she does not realize it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, which she was not really aware of. <br /> <br /> Some images of the film have an impact, but overall, the film is not very engaging. The film seems a little messy, and this is probably largely due to its reissue and the addition of new images. The original version, according to the ending credits, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The magic of the DVD could allow us to see both versions on a single disc, but relaunching this movie is probably not a priority.
