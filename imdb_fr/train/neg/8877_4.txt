'Major Payne' is a film about a major that makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the Marines. This movie does not really have much to offer, but it offers many hilarious moments that deserve to be watched. Do not expect it to be a memorable movie, though. Just expect to laugh through the movie and at the expense of others. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy was hilarious, and that's all I remember about the movie, except for the boys who wanted revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a good movie, and it's probably best to watch it on a rainy day when you have to laugh a bit.
