Poor Tobe Hopper. He directed a classic horror movie "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then, all he has done is horrible. It's probably the worst ... and that says a lot. This is a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) catch fire ... or something. It's hardly an original idea (someone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally, EVERYTHING is badly done! A pathetic game (even Dourif!), A scenario asin, values ​​of production loustiques, special effects of shit ... everything is BAD !!!!! Do not miss ... not even good to laugh.
