After watching the first 20 minutes of Blanche (sorry, I could not have taken more), I confirmed that this was not the case. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "film" is an insult to the real French actors who participate in this farce. It starts from a concept used successfully in French comedies ("The Madness of Sizes", ...): a historical film sound / anachronistic dialogue. This can give brilliant results if it is supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" of direction avoiding the dreaded stigma of "the heavy comedy". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Lou Doillon, hideous face, ruins everything and Blanche, instead comedy, turns into a horror movie. Horror for moviegoers who want to be puzzled and shocked by watching actors as talented as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort who struggle in the middle of this burlesque farce burlesque kitchy-prissy.
