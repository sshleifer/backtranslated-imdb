I give five points out of 10. The five points are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his last days. Unfortunately, the quality of the work and editing of the camera is almost appalling! We have countless complete plans of Hendrix where he could do almost anything, maybe taking a pee? We do not see his hands on the guitar is the point! Plus, we have a lot of Hendrix shots from behind? There seem to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fools are using them all. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to want to wander his attention on the stage, as if Hendrix on the guitar was a mere distraction. While the guy behind is eager to focus on a few girls in the stalls that document the amazing guitar work that bleeds amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider). Vietnam etc. on tracks like Machine Gun, complete movie mess! If Hendrix had lived another two years, Berkeley would be one of those things that would never have happened if a full official version was available. The only jewel it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, but all in a rather poor visual document of the great man and inferior to Woodstock and the Isle of Wight.
