I doubt Jigsaw was fashionable, even at the time, the theme of LSD associated with a mystery of murder being an obvious attempt to catch a young audience of the time without actually showing his understanding of the counterfeit culture of the sixties. Apart from the dated aspect, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including muffled action scenes, idiotic and frozen dialogues, LSD flashbacks that last forever, even after the point has been hammered in the first 60 seconds. , a failure to create a real suspense, even if the plot itself is, on paper, a great way to do that, and an end so banal and predictable (not to mention many bad TV series) that the point culminating is actually an anti-climax. If it were a better film, we could perhaps suspend disbelief on some points that could contribute to enjoyment, but the weaknesses are so blatant that they serve only to highlight the improbabilities that viewers might otherwise ignore . I saw Jigsaw on TV and the late-night TV rate was meant to fill the airspace and let time kill someone's insomnia rather than anything someone should look for actively. At best, three out of 10.
