Okay. For starters, taxi driver is amazing. this is not a taxi driver or amazing. it's bad but I thought it was a bit funny, which means it had redeeming qualities. like the dialogue ... wow. there was more or less intrigue, the characters were all stupid and the movie was preached. I thought that the film would plunge into the violence of the taxi driver, which would have done much worse to get the message at the end of the film. I can not even believe there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie. yes, it's worth watching if you're really bored and want to reaffirm the fact that everyone can make a movie, or at least be able to try.
