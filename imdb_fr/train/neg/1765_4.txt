OK - the helicopter shots are fantastic and the director has made good use of some of Barcelona's main sights. Otherwise ... the value of the production exploded in the very first minutes and the rest of the film looked like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the most depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He was able to use his training in martial arts and become a keen figure of running and jumping. The rest of the distribution was at best wood, but mainly paper. So, if you are nostalgic of Spain, it's a postcard with a touch of action and a good dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
