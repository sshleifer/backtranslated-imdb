I would have rated this movie at minus 10, but unfortunately it's not offered. <br /> <br /> Why I did not go out during the first five minutes of this movie, I can not say. I should have left with my instinct and leave immediately !! Many people in our theater did it and, unfortunately, I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> He missed all the criteria for a film. NO parcel Bad game! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I might never see another movie in which he is. Not a single relationship in history went beyond the speech of the speaker. I liked the tazer scene. Too bad it did not shock a bit of meat in the fool of the plot. Someone has to tazer the writer and director of this movie!
