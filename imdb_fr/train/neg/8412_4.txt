I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was really under-impressed. Despite all the buzz of the Oscars, it's nothing special. Anyone who has been really impressed by this film has never bothered to watch the real musical classics of the film. With the exception of Eddie Murphy's stunning musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is simply a glorified TV movie, without style or flair. Just a group of amateurs who were singing against each other! <br /> <br /> The first half hour was good, but I was irritated to see Eddie Murphy's delightful performance truncated and interrupted by fixtures. It was easily the best songs and the best performances of the film. And the "climbed to the top" part of the movie was the only part of the movie that had a consistent point of view or momentum. The remaining time and the 45 minutes remained an informal and disjointed mess that was neither realistic enough nor as fantastic to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included too many melodies. <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to turn any of these melodies into show pieces as expected. Each issue of the 2nd half was just a close-up after another of people "singing" to each other. And the way they shot the big number "love!" Hudson was criminal! Condon has just stomped her on the stage - no drama at all! God let it be bad! <br /> <br /> AND note to all concerned that the "Conversation Dialogue" could work on stage, but that does not work in the movies (see Evita and Phantom's embarrassing chess). All this "I'll give you a gift something Efff-ieeee!" shit should have been left on the floor of the editing room. These are not "songs". <br /> <br /> Again, the film - with the exception of the incredible performance of Eddie Murphy - was nothing more than a glorified television movie. There must be megabucks behind the PR work for this movie! I wonder how much money was spent to give him this preview "one to beat" Oscar buzz? All in all, this movie was, with the exception of Eddie, NULL NEAR an Oscar-winning movie! (except Eddie) I would rank it up with Grease 2. GREAT disappointment, especially after all the hype!
