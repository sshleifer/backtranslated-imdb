Action, violence, sex and foul language are the things the characters do throughout the movie. And everything they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is known for his violent films (without reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. The actors play very well their stupid characters ... I'm not saying they are stupid but I mean they are very bad actors. This is another unknown action movie from the low budget B series. If you've seen something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like those bad movies like Misbegotten ... do not rent it ... the movies I mentioned .... I give him 1 and a half on5.
