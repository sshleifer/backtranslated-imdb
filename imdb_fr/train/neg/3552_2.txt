I finally saw THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 years for something weird and well, it was certainly not worth the wait to see it all. INCUBUS is a strictly digital horror movie: an invisible killer / monster rapes and murders women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film goes like this: the film starts with the murder; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another murder; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; another murder (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The movie is totally predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red herrings used throughout the film would not convince a 5-year-old. And I understood the secret identity of the incubus when I saw the character. So, when the "shocking" surprise ended, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept laughing a few days after watching the movie. It's so stupid! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is so numbered that the sequence of the "rock band" is one of the few highlights of this dull film. It's a remarkable scene, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so funny and useless: the movie that goes on the big screen shows a moment like a rock video with a guy in red leather pants getting having her hair cut, from this edited with scenes of a girl who is attacked in the toilets of the movie theater by the incubus. The best thing I can say about this movie is cinematography, which I liked. But aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning THE INCUBUS, if not unintentionally hilarious.
