James Bishop (Matt Stasi) visits a "mental health facility" for a residency in medical residency with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he realizes that many trainees are being killed by "The Ripper", who takes their souls to hell, in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and foolish that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when Helen's character, James Bishop's blonde fiancée, arrives at the asylum, that it is almost incredible that a writer has had the courage to include them in a scenario. And what about James returning to the hospital to bring in the files of the deceased patients? And the cast, composed of actors and actresses of ham? Honestly, I do not know what or who is the worst in this film: the script, the director or the cast. The correct answer is certainly all. I saw this movie on cable TV and I'm amazed how a producer can spend money in such a bin. This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurdity of the plot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Demônio" ("Devil")
