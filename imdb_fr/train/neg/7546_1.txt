I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work in a movie like this. I could not believe the other reviews and thought it should not be bad to watch it at least once ... but believe me, it is. <br /> <br /> I did not see the old movie. but why would they want to redo a movie like this? The basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is that it should have an extremely intelligent or very graphic script. This film is not one of those and just silly. I kept watching the movie in the hope that it would become interesting at some point, but that's never the case. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big no no for fans of horror movies as well as for fans of Cage. You could probably make it appear on television.
