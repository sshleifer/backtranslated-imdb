"Indian Cemetery": If these three words appear anywhere in a real estate listing, look for a different neighborhood. A young couple with a girl and a toddler's son moves into a Maine home adjacent to a pet cemetery - and, after a long hike, a former Indian burial ground. It seems that Indian soil can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead - if you do not mind having a fierce pet beast. This can do the same for the dead - if you do not mind having a homicidal zombie around the house. <br /> <br /> Get into a busy two-lane black-top, get a ride on big platforms, if a little weak, old neighbor, and a child who does not get really not enough monitoring, and I think you can understand what's going on from there - an illogical over-the-top disorder, which, in all fairness, offers up a few episodes. <br /> <br /> Well, there are worse adaptations of Stephen King (such as "Maximum Overdrive", which King also realized). But there are much better ones (such as "Salem's Lot", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
