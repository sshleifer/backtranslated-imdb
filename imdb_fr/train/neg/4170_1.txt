It's simply unassailable. If there is a story somewhere here, it's so buried under the horrible characters and the discordant work of the camera that it's indistinguishable. There's a group of vampire hunters doing what they want, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside. They go out and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine an alien puppet covered with blood and blood that screams in horror when a cowboy guy zaps it with a needle for cattle, well, that's what you get here. These people are noisy, hateful, violent and extremely annoying. Then there are anti-human humans, who are so incredibly pompous in their CGI spacecraft that it's impossible to take. Hillary Clinton seems to be compared to a right-wing extremist. They are friends with vampires, or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is the work of the camera. Remember how everyone hated shit thousand one-minute cuts from the recent Rolleball remake? The people who made this movie love this stuff. There's enough here for three really ugly MT-metal videos. <br /> <br /> Nuff says. This thing smells. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
