hg is normally an operator, and this has never really bothered me before - I loved "Bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudo science or heuristic games. the entire movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electric accident and a witch. I'm not opposed to witches, and I liked "Carrie" (the novel and the movie) but it bothered me. I think it's because of the main character who is developing mostly from a power line. the university professor also loses his time studying particular cases. I was not alive in the 1960s to know first-hand whether or not esp was a common mistake at the time, but I suppose any theory of this nature would simply be discredited. What really bothered me was how the police described schizophrenics as ruthless and unpredictable villains who may seem normal in 99% of cases, then break. Nothing could be further from the truth. I hate such concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> The film contained decent concepts. I loved the way the witch used men; it was a good change. I liked the way she could be attractive, but she did not do it when she was surrounded by her forced lovers. I found it interesting to see how her second lover also burned her face. If the screenplay had been retouched a few weeks before the production and was not only aimed at making its audience quieter, it could have been a decent movie.
