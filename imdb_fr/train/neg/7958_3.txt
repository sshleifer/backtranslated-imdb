Protected works in a linear fashion; Do not expect quick action, and you will not find yourself with a gasping breath, because there are simply no moments sitting on the edge. <br /> <br /> There is not much to fear, so wait for one either. I would not blame the acting game - the series would have been much worse without the Wu game that was the only saving grace of the film. And, oh that pretty little girl too. <br /> <br /> Humor is, at best, weak, and the show should also be considered an anti-drug campaign that uses the usual shock tactics scenes with Zhang) to tell us things we know already - that drugs are separating families, that heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to wean, you will fall into a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I know it may sound a little hard, but I think the show is far from homogeneous and somewhat uneven (* SPOILER ALERT *: let's take the example of Andy Lau who was brought to the police station: what? We have just been told 'oh we have all the videocassettes and evidence against you since 1997', and that's how it got caught. No, no action to chase a car, just a jump backstage, which in some way undermined Wu's infiltration role.) I suspect that lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean film production company.
