Some friends of gorehound recommended me "Live Feed" and basically I really can not complain, because the film certainly offers copious amounts of raw coal and buckets full of money, but it is obviously not A very good movie. More concretely than taking advantage of the latest trend of horror movies, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to outdo all the other films of this sub-genre (and this includes the models "Hostel" and "Saw" ) with his patients. and twisted makeup effects and thoroughly depraved strokes of bare co-eds tried, suffering and begging for their lives. There is no real plot to describe. Five friends in their twenties, completely disconcerted, go on a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but other than that, I do not really know why they chose to travel there instead of going to Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the culture of the continents and even provoke a restless scene when they witness the slaughter of a cute butcher on the market. The quintet then plunges into the dark night and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. Simple excuses are clearly not enough, because the gangster follows them into an adult theater and gradually submits them to cruel torture. A girl has her impaled bosom and another poor girl even has a venomous snake embedded in her throat; yuck. "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring despite the bloodshed and amateurish production values ​​are pretty hard to ignore, even if you are used to watching an independent fan-boy cinema like this one. The big guy on the cover, an oriental hangman of S & M, is certainly cool and he is also the most talented of all the group, because at least he keeps his mouth closed all the time. I would not recommend exactly this pile of grime, but hey, if you like loud and hideous metal music, images of nauseating torture and stupid losers, go ahead, look!
