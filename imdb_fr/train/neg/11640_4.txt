Pier Paolo Pasolini, or pee-pee-pee as I prefer to call him (because of his love for showing male genitals), is perhaps the most overrated European Marxist director - and they are very thick. How everyone can see "art" in this disordered and cheap concoction, it's beyond me. Some of the "stories" here could have come straight out of a soft-core porn movie, and I do not even talk so much about nudity as simple, trivial, and often vain stories. Anyone who appreciates this relatively attractive but silly quirk should really bite into the 1970's "Der Schulmaedchenreport" German film series, in the soft porn genre, because that's what "Decameron" looks like to me. <br /> <br /> the film is sloppy at almost every level, from start to finish: <br /> <br /> 1. Edition. An example: at 1 o'clock: 15 minutes: 45 seconds, there is a chase scene that is clearly in the wrong place. It was supposed to be about a minute later, but I guess Pasolini had to hire boos-up editors who have little time for the "details" of making a movie. Fans of Pee-pee-pee could probably fix it by saying that it was placed there intentionally - which I doubt very much. Moreover, even if it were true, it would be even worse, because this story does not win anything by making it more difficult to follow. (It's not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of Tarantino's broken-form movies ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. Vey sloppy. Triple Pee fans (the 8 of them) proudly declare how 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". (Are the actors not people? Or are they Martians? Of course, many actors have a lower than normal IQ, but does that mean we should treat them with contempt ...? ) Other filmmakers have used amateurs and have succeeded (like Alan Parker or De Niro), so why are PPP lovers so awful in his films? The answer is once again an appalling loss of profit. Pasolini is sloppy in everything, and that includes trying to make the most of his toothless amateurs as he can. He's a lazy director, a perfectionist if you want. The anti-Kubrick, I guess ... The main purpose of the pee-pee-pee casting was to find as many older people as possible without teeth (and young men as they please). In the world of Pasolini, there is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It's all well and good to have them without teeth, but at least try to gain at least semi-decent performances from these inexperienced neo-thespians, otherwise you yourself are an amateur - an amateur director, in the case of Pasolini . That 3P-0 is not capable of this feat or just does not care, it does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he did not even notice the terrible game?) <br /> <br /> The audio. The synchronization. If 3P-0 feels that the microphones are too complicated when shooting a film, it should have at least made a concerted effort in post-production, that is to say by forcing all these small actors to tell their aftershocks in the studio, so that we, the viewers, do not have to watch the mouth move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the film. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of concept. We have about a dozen stories that are not significantly related. Some are anti-churches (later), while others are just sex stories, that is, cheap (sometimes gay) male fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else. Stories and characters are not fun (at all) at the smart level, but at the lowest level. The 10 year old can laugh here ... and there is nothing wrong with that, but so do not call it exalted, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a consequence of point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories. That goes without saying. Pee-pee-pee could have organized the order otherwise, and we would have had exactly the same movie. It also means that you can feel free to start from the middle, then back to the beginning, and so on. "Decameron" is like a bowl of spaghetti: when you start eating it, you can start with the yarn you want, it makes no difference at all. <br /> <br /> 6. The uselessness of the resolutions of the stories. Most stories end with a joke or a cheap joke, that is to say, a damn line of typing straight from a pornographic comic, while some stories do not even have a conclusion: they simply end. Finito. At best, stories are half-anecdotes to look at, almost no deeper meaning - unless you find "deep" meanings in a porn. There is of course nothing easier than to look for and find a "meaning" where there is none. Therefore, even any hardcore porn movie can be philosophized / meditated to infinity. It's easy and fun. Try, oh ye 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> When it comes to denigrating the Church ... Some spectators are excited about its attack on Catholicism and what is not. In principle, everything is fine - after all, I am an atheist myself - but what these people do not know is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's like the pot is calling the black kettle. A Marxist criticizing the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does he find the nerve? In addition, Pasolini was not an atheist, therefore his high and powerful position and his own justice is not justified. After all, Marxists are believers: they have simply substituted for the accepted god the idea of ​​a utopia, which is simply another supernatural fantasy at will. So I can not marvel at the anti-religious antics of PPP. <br /> <br /> This sophomoric anthology of Hummdorama ends with Pasolini: "I wonder ... Why produce a work of art while it's nice to dream it?" He did not really talk about this idiotic little film like art, was he ...? In case he was - the poor man lost - I wonder why he did not let him dream and did not shoot all those bad movies ... <br /> <br /> I want to read my modified subtitles from Bergman Films?
