Too many holes in this film to be nice AND EARLIER of a bizarre almost Hollywood ending completely out of context with the rest of the movie (it's not a spoiler, you'll never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You will also need thick skin for all sorts of politically correct shades. The conflict between whites and blacks was highly artificial and one-sided. I did not understand why the author had made the local black community behave so unacceptably. Is he / she trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> A really weird movie. Look only if you like to be really bored by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that can or could not be supposed to have happened. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, filming and playing are excellent.
