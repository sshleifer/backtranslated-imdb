Not funny - how can we connect that to Monty Python? It's absolutely ridiculous - there's no laughing. It's not funny on top, but ugly, weird, just for a weird pleasure and it seems to me that these people were constantly in the same state. Unfortunately, something that did not make them funny. <br /> <br /> It should be given some points of effort, etc. In fact, there seems to be a laughing line - or is there one? Hmmm .... Since there is almost no laughter, it's a questionable question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm committing an injustice - it may be a kind of exercise. A kind of art - in this case everything is allowed, too bad. <br /> <br /> But these guys play women with high-pitched voices, their noses rolled up. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one obvious heir to the intellectual spirit of the Monty Pythons: Stephen Colbert and perhaps Jon Stewart.
