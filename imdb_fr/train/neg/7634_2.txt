This is the kind of film that shows the poverty of French cinema in terms of thrillers. The director's desire to "sound American" is so blatant that you will not be fooled at all, unless you have not seen any film in series since. "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two male officers (or a year and a half, looks more like you'll see), horrible murders, a more complicated plot than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre (See the stranger in Strasbourg, stupid and stupid a few years ago) .The scenes with his pregnant wife, supposed to be a counterpart of the otherwise dark atmosphere of the rest of the plot, are among the worst in the world. all time filmed.Add a scorching love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus attract the vast teen audience. A violent and absurd conclusion, followed by a silent epilogue that could make a great advertisement for the Riviera, is really the silence of the lame.
