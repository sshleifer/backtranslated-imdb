I had high hopes for this film, because I liked the book so much. However, I do not think I would have understood the principle of the film if I had not already read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people who are trying to break the bonds of government that trumps him, but the book describes the suffering in much more detail. Corrupt officials have a comfortable and almost luxurious life, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare essentials for their survival. Most people may feel that way with their leaders and leaders, whether they are really oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems to exist in many places in our modern world. I have read the book for many years, but I often hear references to Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak in the media and in informal conversations. Probably many people who use these terms do not realize where they come from. I highly recommend reading the book.
