This film is one of the most ill-intentioned action movies ever on film. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is quite funny, but adds a really cheesy action between friends to the mix, an eccentric and overflowing villain, an intrigue of love interest and one of the worst endings of all time, and you have everything to is the little cure for suicide for people who love life and who, until watching "Showdown", had never considered committing suicide with a blowtorch. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's just me but the homosexual subtext is not too subtle. There are constant references to the male genitalia, and no longer to women. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about their manly roles and, in fact, before making a suicide folly, Brandon tells Dolphy: "In case we do not succeed, I want to tell you that you have the greatest d --- J have never seen. "<br /> <br /> Now, is that what a normal man would say to another man? In a movie ACTION no less? And would you like it to be your dying words ?? ?? <br /> <br /> Later, there is this little gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (concerning the villain): "I would like to cut some parts of his anatomy". Brandon: "Dude, you have a fixation." <br /> <br /> As the guy from RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, "Unfortunately, Dolph does not respond with," I have a fixation? I have a fixation ?! You are the one who decides that his last words should concern my loved ones! I was just going to cut my ears and my nose, man. "<br /> <br /> It's stupid and stupid and a lot of fun if you are someone who likes to receive root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain.This is pretty much an au pair. the whole family!
