Well we can not waste our time because of a big series of stars .. I think all I can see is a group of talents who waste their time on a big screen with a pathetic humor that will call I do not know who? pathetic songs that will be heard by whom? pathetically abrupt reversals justified by whom? race against time? you mean a waste of time? OK, you start by spoiling your child, then you give him a lesson. We are so ignorant of this fact. Anyone who said that his new concept was brilliant is probably another species than the man. a message to give, but it could very well have been given by a stranger sitting next to you on the bus rather than going for a film so useless to learn. Hindi movies have already proved it so much and I can not waste my time writing about waste anyway!
