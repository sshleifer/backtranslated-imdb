Note that this movie is great - but only in the way it tells a very bad story. Stella is terribly rude and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobbish and witty. Never never learns better. Is it realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her showy manners and dress, but does not understand that she just needs to mitigate the whole thing? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman and a very good mother. Letting go so that her daughter can be associated with a group of fanatical snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see may have been normal at the time (people taking a beer or two, playing the piano, dancing), but it's a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not let our child live this way!" Save me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the unwashed working class can never hope to aspire to the peaks of the upper classes. And it's just a load of crap.
