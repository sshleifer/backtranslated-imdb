It's a beautiful story and it was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it.) However, despite the fact, it's still a movie and it's a movie site. I realize that independent movies have a hard time finding good actors, but wow. The only mediocre one is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he could not compensate for all the actors (including the one who plays it in his youth) an acting game absolutely atrocious. Certainly, the scenario was terribly clich√©, but even in this case, you must have decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone, because it is very badly done in all categories. Read books on the true story of the American Mason, as they give these men the respect they deserve.
