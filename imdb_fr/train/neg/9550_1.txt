After Highlander 2 (for which I still deny), I thought it was impossible to do a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with the details of the computer and the details of the original movie. The original Wargames had at least some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers, except the use of a word processor. I doubt he even watched the original movie. The acting is not even convincing. Save yourself, do not look at this film. I do not care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can not turn it off. THIS FILM WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.
