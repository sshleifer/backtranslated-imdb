Although the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, this is a totally false assumption. It is an adaptation of 9 stories unrelated to the collection of stories "Decameron" dating from the fourteenth century, produced by Giovanni Bocaccio. <br /> <br /> Located within a predominantly peasant population of a medieval Italian city, it has consequences in this world and in time. A realistic vision of life in this world, it's like taking a trip back in time. <br /> <br /> Given the human element portrayed in its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality among its protagonists - as well as the ironies of life, sometimes. It can also be considered a general satire of the rules of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Nothing exceptional, but certainly interesting if one presents neither expectations nor hypotheses.
