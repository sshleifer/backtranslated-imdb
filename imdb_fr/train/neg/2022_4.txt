Dude, that has a lot of good reviews in the books. Frankly, I found it too slow and unattractive from the start. I kept waiting for it to pick up a little speed, but it never happened. This film is largely overestimated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with King James English, never called me, anyway, so maybe it's just me. There is a good part of these in the first half of the film, because they show Ronald Colman the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film include - thanks to a restored copy - decent cinematography images and a young, slender and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's too boring, there are too many rehearsals in some scenes to be able to be seen again. Also, we all know that most of the actors are crazy, anyway, but well done in Hollywood for having demonstrated it here in this story.
