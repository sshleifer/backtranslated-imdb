I was happy when I could not see this one when he was screened at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw he was going to be on the cable tonight, I warned him as soon as I could. So was it worth the wait? Well, let's go back a bit, because I have not given the plot yet. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know what his career is in life. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray, totally hammered, asks Sean to remove the guy they followed. And it continues from there. Which brings me back to the question asked. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the editing was pretty good and George Wendt stole the movie. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it's not nearly as violent as I've been led to believe and somewhere in the film, the balloon is not only let go, but groped and taken in the opposite direction. I know exactly where it happened, but I can not say without ruining the movie. But needless to say, it happened. The end does not save the film either. Stuart Gordon poor, nothing can be good like "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My note: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows her ta-tas in a fantasy , then in the following: no more ta-tas and it sways and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
