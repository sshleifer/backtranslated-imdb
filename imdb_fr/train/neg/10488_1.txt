Elvis left the building and he is lucky because he did not have to look at this fucking whore. Scene after scene, director Joel Zwick finds a way to make a non-funny story even less fun. Filled with senseless deaths, banal gay characters and jokes, this film is more desperate than amusing. This is the kind of film that makes hope that Kim Basinger will follow Doris Day in premature retirement. Remember her as she was (talented) and not what she became. David Leisure, the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. Zwick finds ways to minimize his talents at every turn. The guy who plays Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the King. The only good part of the cast is the girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like him and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie is to look for Tom Hanks' cameo. The cameo is not so funny, but at least it's not painful. One may wonder if Zwick has incriminating images of Hanks or something that would make him do this movie.
