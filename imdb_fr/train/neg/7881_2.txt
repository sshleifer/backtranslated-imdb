This film is a portrait of the semi-spastic Benjamin Benjamin who has to go to a boarding school because of his bad grades in maths. He had not had the best experiences of his life before and had serious self-esteem issues. After a difficult start in his new school, he begins to make friends, falls in love with a girl and does some tricks of American teenagers. <br /> <br /> Besides some elements of comedy, the film is told with a lot of seriousness. , focusing on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not already like this story, save your time and look at something else. If you do, please consider the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly badly and then, he feels sorry for himself all the time. For me, he was not that kind of "charming loser" with whom one can feel sympathy and laugh with. Instead, he and his behavior really pissed me off and, with my adolescence a little less far away, I could hardly stand to watch her. <br /> <br /> 2) The film barely tries to be realistic and the story seems to be from me. Discover the characters just are not (except perhaps for Janosch). And yes, I know this film is based on an autobiography written by a 17-year-old - but having some experiences with German schools and German youth, I do not think so. <br /> <br /> 3) Showing sexual arousal is really an important thing for a movie with this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys do a "cum on cookie" contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his cum during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the wet biscuit after the sperm. Although it amused me a little despicably, it is neither funny nor highlight the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a subplot on the family of Benjamin and his father betraying his wife - again, I do not know why he is there and where to put it. It bothered me. <br /> <br /> Well, I personally hated this movie because it had the character of Benjamin, without message, concept, pattern, whatever, and it's a failed attempt to be dramatic and serious. However, I can imagine that some people may find this sensitive and touching. If you liked "The Other Sister", you will surely love this one as well. I hated both. <br /> <br /> The 17 year old boys should not write an autobiography and if they did, it does not seem like the best idea to make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
