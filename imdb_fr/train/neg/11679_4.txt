First of all, this movie is not a "thriller". Nor is it "striking, tense". It could have been based on the scenario, but the slowness of the direction makes it difficult to penetrate. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only have an idea of ​​the ingenuity of the photo. That leaves us with more than two hours of long sequences with music, punctuated with action scenes that do not catch the viewer, and scenes of "cunning vixen" that inject a little more intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish it was the fast thriller promised by the box. It would have been an exceptional film. Instead, Spike Lee pushed him to the end.
