Seriously, I read some of the reviews on this movie and I have to ask if you were watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give a lot of credit to the directors of the set for their ability to recreate Los Angeles in the 1930s, but then what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are friendly, the story seems aimless, Karen Black is just not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just disgusting. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me wish the animated version, oh!) Then you had the terrifying child actor, the terrifying Billy Barty, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that moviegoers love and the rest of us look at each other and say, "But damn it!"
