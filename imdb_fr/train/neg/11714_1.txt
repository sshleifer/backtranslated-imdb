The United States seems to be leading the British police who are all armed to the teeth and did you know that the IDC agents wear the uniform when they stop work and go down to the pub! This film must be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst representation of the "real" British police ever imposed on the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr. Snipes might need the money to pay his arrears, but what a good actor like Charles Dance is a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the worst budget we have had "B" movie of the 50s. An hour and a half of suicide and time, I will never come back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as a real scourge.
