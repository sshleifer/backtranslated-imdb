This is a good example of how it is PROHIBITED to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little constructive dialogue, no context for events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused and distraught spectator; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented do not make sense without listening to the director's commentary. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with a focus on child abuse. It includes archival footage of real and horrific acts of violence, including executions in wartime. Although it works in the context of the film, I believe that the ideas behind the film could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This movie is NOT intended for people with stomach pain or insults, and should not be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The highlight is anti-climactic compared to the rest of the film. If you do not listen to the comment while it occurs, you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was a one-shot, "sit down and let him talk, without cuts," kind of comment. Although it is not necessarily bad, the director often ends up getting lost and spending minutes complaining about his college, his filming conditions, his co-producers, his bad movie and a dozen of other stuff. Constant negativity is detrimental to what is also an essential tool for understanding the film. <br /> <br /> The film was shot many years ago in 16mm and Super8 format over a period of four years with an extremely small budget. As a result, the video and audio quality is poor. It's not enough to make a bad movie, but it only makes things worse.
