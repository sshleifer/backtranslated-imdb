What could have been an engaging and emotionally charged personality study is totally undermined by the predictable factor. Fox agrees with Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard-trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Orchestra until his schizophrenic fits push him into the street and mow him. Journalist Steve Lopez {Robert "rehab" Downey} gets to know him and tells his story. Taking each element of the classic movies "how to hit the skates", borrowing very generously from "A Beautiful Mind", taking the false "feel good" attitude of movies like "Rocky" -you choose the number of continuation- and whip up a lot of 1930s-style melodrama, all that remains on the screen is the shell of a burnt film. It's corny, banal, quite predictable and plays too often on our feelings. I hate to say it, but it's the kind of film that, if you say you hate it, people will look at you badly. I really wish I could say something positive about this film, but I really can not. The acting game buys it a little, but not enough for me to give it more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie stuff. Not worth your time.
