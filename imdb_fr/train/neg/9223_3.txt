From the nepotism capital of the world, comes another junk movie in a fancy wrapper. "CQ" tells a story in a lame and disjointed mess that is little more than a bunch of stupid caricatures, a baby and a straight man Davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi movie. I see no reason for anyone to want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to make a movie. (RE)
