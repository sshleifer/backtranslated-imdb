The film confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. By portraying the legal execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film elevates a murderous relative to martyrdom for Christ. In one way or another, according to the plot, God is scandalized by the fact that society chose to get rid of a fanatic who killed his own parents by torching them while they slept defenseless in their bed. Yet this same god is not indignant at the actions of the murderer. The main character, a non-religious pregnant suicidal woman, finally gives her own life in a provocative but improbable attempt to unsuccessfully save that doomed murderer. In the other threads of the underdeveloped plot, Jesus returns as a helpless and frustrated tramp, symbolically releasing God's wrath. The modern, dull incarnation of Christ does not dehumanize it, but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions. He is unable to affect humanity for good and skims without emotion the limits of life while waiting for humanity to destroy itself. Meanwhile, with a little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman ends up with the ability to reincarnate in her child without a newly born soul, saving some of humanity from the wrath of the whole world. powerful. I have also interpreted this as a statement in favor of abortion at certain levels. This film that tries to weave many religious themes in a thriller fails to argue a religious argument that I could interpret clearly, if not to mock the beliefs of people. This raises many questions that he does not even attempt to answer. He ignores the religious values ​​of his audience while trying to present an asin version of his accomplishment. Idiot
