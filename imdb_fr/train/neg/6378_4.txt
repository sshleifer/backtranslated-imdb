This movie was fun at times, sometimes it was even downright funny. <br /> <br /> The underlying message I draw from the film is that women are responsible for all human problems. Whenever a woman is portrayed in the movie, she is lazy, bitchy or fluffing a poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think the message is good for homosexual women or men. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's just someone's point of view. Even if I do not agree with that, they are still entitled to it. <br /> <br /> A funny movie, but some comments made by others are just stupid. Best movie of my foot.
