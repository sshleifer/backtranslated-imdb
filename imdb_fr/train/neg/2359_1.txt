It was supposed to be Freddy's latest film (and this, for over 10 years) - you would think they would have tried to make a good movie. But they ended up giving us the worst of the series (and that says a lot). The plot was meaningless (I really do not remember), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them dead) and Freddy's sarcasm was even worse than usual. The only thing that seems really positive is a brief (and funny) cameo from Johnny Depp (the first movie "Nightmare" was his first). <br /> <br /> I also saw it originally in a theater where the last section was. (recounting Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well - the 3-D was zero - faded colors and a blurry, fuzzy image. In addition, the three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. Everyone burst out laughing. It looks even worse on 2D TV. Useless and stupid - very dull too. Skip this one and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
