DOC SAVAGE: THE BRONZE MAN (1 of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Terrible and dreadful film ... based on Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson's series of pulp magazines / fascicles ... about 'A super hero adventure hero in the' 30s and his five assistants, all experts in a field of activity that allows them to fight against evil. It was a nice hokey series ... but rather fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew that they had created a movie version in the 70s with Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never got the chance to see her. He never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on television. Now that I have finally seen the movie, I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously ... it's kind of talkative and campy ... much like the old Batman TV series ... only without the benefit of being funny ... or to have no visual flair. Cornish dialogue, cheese special effects, stupid stereotypes, shabby and bad action scenes, bad actor. In fact, I find it quite fascinating in its malice ... what could they have thought of? Arnold Schwarzenegger would have played in a modern remake ... but I do not think it would have been much better.
