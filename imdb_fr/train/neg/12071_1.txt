Terrible ... just terrible. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And I have seen very bad pictures over the years. The sound is void, as is the quality of the image, the direction, the play of the actors, etc., etc. The only good shots (which means funny because they are so bad) are the special effects. Overall, there is about 5 minutes of laughter. The rest of the movie inflicts brain damage.
