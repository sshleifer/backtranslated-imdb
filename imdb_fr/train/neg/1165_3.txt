I will be brief because I know I do not need much to say. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that obviously appeals to some, but I found it terribly bland from almost at the very beginning. The film did very little to make the characters friendly and the story was sometimes so complicated that I lost interest. As I said, I know others appreciated, but I found that Kitamura's "Alive" was anything but a lame and extremely boring drama disguised as a science-fiction action-provoking movie. . I felt attracted by this film, based on its intriguing principle and extremely exciting coverage. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Forget it for the much better first year effort of Kitamura "Versus" or his 2004 riot "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... And do not get me wrong, I'm always up for a good thinker movie, but it certainly was not that. It was not a minute ago that I worried about a single event in this overly predatory and dialogue-laden film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
