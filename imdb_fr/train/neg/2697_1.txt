Higher Learning draws on the personal experiences of director John Singleton at the University of Southern California. A film centered on racial politics that takes place in modern colleges. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around three main characters: Malik Williams, a carefree athlete of low race, African American male. Kristin Conner, a sweet and protected white girl, and Remy, a white man unsophisticated and unconnected. All three are overwhelmed by the sudden reality that university life is not as good as it is advertised because they are disappointed to be unprepared (Malik), naive (Kristin) and unwanted (Remy). <BR /> <br /> A good thing about the film is that it shows that modern American colleges are only high schools in the broad sense. Colleges are not places to build their character, develop their potential or improve their personal advancement, but they are institutions used to bring together all kinds of students in a unique atmosphere. It is an experience that is usually built for failure for most students. It would have been nice if the film had built a story about this parody rather than about racial politics. <br /> <br /> But that's not the case and that's where the movie breaks up. Singleton, it seems, had a very bad experience in Southern California. Through this film, he leaves everything lying around. There is no need to beat around the bush here. Singleton makes it easy to see the heroes and villains of this piece. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the movie are pretty much seen as the heroes here, while all the whites in the movie are seen as villains, except for Kristin, who was raped by another white student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black gang members helping a white girl after she showed them who allegedly raped her? The ease that black gang members have at university when a group of skinheads meet in a dark dormitory planning violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They seem to be the third choice for the roles they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were not available). O'Shea Jackson, aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne has unfortunately been poorly received here as a history teacher. Only Michael Rappaport behaved well in this film and he felt that his character, composed of the three main characters, had changed the most in the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to address the issue of race and inequality in American university life with this film. And he did it badly enough. It was a bit like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is much more complex than it seems and people are the same and it should be known. Higher Learning is proof that he did not understand this at all. Seeing the film, then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same audience he would like to talk about. Not to mention that it would not entertain them in the least.
