The movie begins with a scrolling text that takes almost five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what is happening. It could have been done easily with a role but you get a scrolling text effect. Shortly after you are bombarded with characters you learn a little, keep in mind that it's ALL you'll learn about them. The plot begins to take flight and hangs throughout the film. Not only does the plot change, but you may even wonder if you are watching the same movie. I have never played video games, but know people who have them. If I understand correctly whether you played the game or not, this film is not better. Save your money unless you like to sleep in theaters.
