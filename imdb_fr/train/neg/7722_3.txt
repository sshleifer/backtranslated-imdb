Extremely poor action movie starring the ever-wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee, trapped in an accompanying role that seems to never gel. The action is at best average, a little nudity is inserted and yes Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> The installation is that of the usual renegade cop, forced to force a new partner to take a big deal, the manufacturers try at least to give the formula a twist making Lundgren the cop with the values The modern city is smooth but the development of the characters is nil, which makes it almost comical. You have to see the oriental warrior costume Lundgrens for the big confrontation. The action sequences are encrypted and Lee (who will become the excellent The Crow) never has the opportunity to show all the genius of the martial arts. But given his illustrious parentage, he was under tremendous pressure and was much better served because he did not have to live up to his father by assuming a very different role in The Crow, which showed how much he could have become a unique actor. if not for his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> Unless you're a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80s-style action movies (think of Cobra, etc.), then avoid them. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
