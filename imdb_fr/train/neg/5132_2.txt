I discovered this film because the Jew Ben Chaplin of Game On was there. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to go to Hollywood and play in the main role. He failed thanks to God. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo in the role of an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Uma Thurman to go out with Ben Chaplin, because she thinks that Ben Chaplin will not like her ugly. The movie is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is incredibly predictable, from the most insignificant to the most serious: all this montage where all three have fun, then the piece of photo. These two scenes made me cringe! Janeane's character is outrageously arrogant (and guesses her role as an actress and arch-feminist standing). She says the film is "anti-feminist" when in reality it is just realistic. Men more often than not do not go on the personality. It is interesting to note his hypocrisy too. She had been a feminist and "actress" for years before playing that role and then suddenly decided that the movie was bad. I guess she hated the idea and the script of this movie before it was released, but she made sure to keep quiet about herself so she could get paid for that movie parody. I mean come! She acted for heaven's sake! This movie was really anti-men, if so. He portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in the groin and those who do silly things to attract the attention of Uelle Thurman's character, Noelle. <br /> <br /> There are also other negatives in this movie, like the character of Ben Chaplin the Brit that every American finds cute and Jamie Foxx being Chaplin's best black friend and of course, Foxx has had to try to imitate his accent several times for good measure. Is this the best the writers could propose? Blimey, they've never done it before, with the exception of all the Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore movies ever made. There is also a really horrible phone sex scene that is just grotesque and proves how cheap the movie is. The other reviews here all say how Janeane Garofalo is not ugly but is actually beautiful. Uh, did I watch the same movie? She is certainly not a spectator and the only good thing about this movie is that she was rightly chosen as the ugly one. That said, I do not see the appeal of Uma Thurman either: she is thin and thin. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this movie if you've never watched it: <br /> <br /> You'll know what will be the end; <br /> <br /> You will find the sex scene on the phone painfully embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
