"True" story of a late monster that appears when an American factory begins to pollute the waters. Fun, but not really good, the movie about monsters has a lot of people trying to get the monster and find out what's going on, but not in a completely involved way. Give him some points for giving us a giant monster that they have clearly built to scale for some scenes, but take it away because it looks like a non-threatening puppy. A fun operating movie that is pleasantly stupid in a good state of mind. (My only complaint is that the print used on the Elvira version is so poor that it looks like a copy of a used video cassette that was past its peak 20 years ago.)
