This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but it sucks. First thing, what the heck are these punk trying to do with school? I think children do not seem to be aware of the seriousness of the situation. The guy Deker tells the girl that they are under his responsibility when she asks him why he wants to come back for them but just after that, he gives a gun to the guy in a wheelchair and wants him to repair the line phone alone. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors have to pay for their food, but why not just give them the money to make such a stupid film or give that money to a charity. Oh yes, and none of them knows how to aim. The stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like crazy. They all want to look professional but they are all nil. One more thing, I do not think there is any emergency exit in the school. The children try several doors but they are all locked. What happens if there is a fire and Dumass's safety officer is dead? It is illegal to have no emergency exit at school. Anyway, there is still a lot to say, but it would be too long. I spent some time of my life watching shit.
