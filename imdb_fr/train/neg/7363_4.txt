The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that there was Erika Eleniak. She is sexy as always, but she plays the second role with Wolf Larson. Too bad, because she has more abilities than she allowed him. The film consists largely of endless shots that quickly become monotonous - especially when you see mostly bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing at Larson and that he alone is armed with a revolver (which NEVER misses bullets) rather easily. The effects of the earthquakes are decent, but there are also a lot of fuzzy movements and bad explosions from CGI. As a psychotic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious gibberish he has to spout out is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman, or Larson (assuming he has them), the Completists may want to take a look at this one, for others it's just a rental. (* 1/2)
