Obvious attack against Microsoft, made by people who do not seem to understand the intellectual property nor the market economies in general. <br /> <br /> Tim Lobbins, shy liberal, plays a painfully obvious caricature on ticket doors. right and left. <br /> <br /> Microsoft may engage in anti-competitive activities, but it is unlikely that they will kill people. Therefore, the film is excessive and ridiculous from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The "deeper" point is apparently the fact that major technological innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this does not take into account the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed without the commercial incentives (and rewards) offered by intellectual property. <br /> <br /> It's one thing to oppose anticompetitive behavior - - it's common sense. It is quite another thing to oppose the competition of the market, which represents the film's mantra ("knowledge belongs to humanity"). <br /> <br /> Yet another example of Hollywood completely disconnected from reality.
