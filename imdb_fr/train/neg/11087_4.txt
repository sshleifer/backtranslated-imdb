Second-ranked American leader Guy Madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western ?? which, having very modest references, appears as a routine (although it presents a rather interesting score). The plot offers a slight interest: the title, incidentally, refers to an injured man involved in the murderous murder of gunmen on a ranch ?? the property of the family of their pursuer, the cavalry agent Madison. The younger brothers and sisters of the latter are determined that the injured party, now in their care, lead them to the leader of the gang responsible; In the end, the identity of the mysterious man is a surprise ?? and both, ironically, become involved with one of Madison's sisters (another is raped during the raid). The star of the Euro-sect Rosalba Neri appears innocently as a hostess and ex-flame Madison.
