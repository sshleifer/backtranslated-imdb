I am completely confused by the reason why this film is even loved, and even less held in such high esteem, especially by so many critics who are, moreover, quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is one key word that describes this movie basically - irritating. <br /> <br /> The easiest example to explain is the use - or, more accurately, the abuse - of the music by the director. In the first part, a really dull reggae melody is played about three times (once, it's too often). But in the second half, "California Dreamin '" is played at least seven times, usually at the highest volume. God, whether you liked the song or not before, you would be completely tired at the end. Think about it, some people claim to have seen this film four or five times. That means they listened to California Dreamin 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All this useless hyper-repetition (that does not contribute anything to the story) could possibly be excused if the rest of the film had a persistent merit, or if the story was in any way whatsoever. <br /> <br /> But that's not the case. <br /> <br /> The only aspect that I found sympathetic was the charge of Bridgette Lin and still playing in Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even that has dissipated fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the undeserved high reputation of this film will convince many funny suckers to go see him. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you've never seen a Hong Kong movie before, do not start with this one. <br /> <br /> If you feel obliged to watch it, avoid at all costs to see it in the cinema. The fast forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
