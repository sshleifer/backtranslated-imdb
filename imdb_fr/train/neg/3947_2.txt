In comics, modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden who plays Modesty Blaise looks more like an anorexic dummy. Nor does it have the moral or personality that Modesty has in comics. Modesty would never give a woman the advice to show more skin to make more money. I do not see any similarity with my comics with Modesty and this movie. It's as if a Mission Impossible movie tells the story of Ethan Hunt locked up in the high school detention room and talking to the concierge about when he went to college and where Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). Soo, if you're a fan of Modesty, do not see the movie, you're just going to get angry. If you do not know much about the Modesty comic, rent another movie and do not waste your time with it. I do not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name. I will ask for a refund at my DVD rental store tomorrow.
