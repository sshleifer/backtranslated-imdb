The reaction of viewers to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, promoted as NOT a remake of the original 1963 film (quite true), will be based, I suppose, on the following: those who were great fans of either book or original movie will not think much about this one ... and those who have never been exposed to one or the other, and who are great fans of the current Hollywood trend that "special effects" are the first and last word of how "good" a movie is, will like it. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was not a real adaptation of the book. According to the articles I had read, this film was supposed to cover other aspects of the book that the first one had never discussed. And, that seemed reasonable, no movie can cover a book word by word except for the length of THE STAND! (And not even at that time) But there were things in this movie that had never been mentioned, or even suggested, in the film. It reminded me of how they decided to kill the black man in the original version of THE SHINING. I did not like that either. The press release of the film SHOULD have said this: "We had the very simple basic idea of ​​Shirley Jackson's book, we kept the same house names and several (but not all) names of the main character, but we decided to write our own story and, damn it, we first watched THE CHANGELING, THE SHINING and GHOST, and decided to add some as well. "<br /> <br /> 2. They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting a carefully chosen guest, who had already grazed the paranormal, to investigate a house that seemed to be truly "born for life". No, on the contrary, this "doctor" brought everyone home under the false pretext of studying their "insomnia" (he really invited them there to scare them, then to see how they reacted to their fear ... like lab rats, which he mentioned was never told they were part of an experience ... good guy). This doctor, who did not have the same name, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original film as the night of the day. <br /> <br /> 3. Contrary to the statement that was used to promote the two films "some houses are born badly", this house was not born badly, but became bad because of what it was went over there ... and this time, Nel manages to get rid of the mystery (shades of LE CHANGELING). The only problem was that the so-called mystery had been told so incoherently that I'm sure it was a mystery to most viewers ... but then there was no mystery at first (not in the book ) because the house was bad to start with. This is her first "victim" who died before she even saw her. <br /> <br /> 4. The way Luke's character was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a good-natured playboy who would inherit one day from home (and was really skeptical about his "story") ... and in this one, he was just a grumpy nerd with a vinous voice that was not coming to sleep (insomnia remember) and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also pissed off at the way the movie jumped, almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word (the scene with Nel's sister's family and the little talk of Mrs. Dudley's opening ...) from flights that made me think. more of these other movies than THE HAUNTING. It's like she can not decide what she wants to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed Nel's story throughout the movie. The original looked so much like a Gothic novel that the story was mostly told in the first person, through Nel's eyes, and we've always been aware of his thoughts. This totally unique touch has been completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel a real heroine. The first Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be otherwise after sacrificing eleven years of her life to a selfish old woman and a malevolent sister?) And she loved to moan, and she was angry. .. This one was almost too good to be true. This has never been so obvious as in the climax of the film where the writer had visibly watched GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7. They changed the history of the house and it occupies too many people. There was no Abigail Crain (the daughter of Hugh whose legend had a prominent place in the original versions), there was no "companion" and there was no crib. There was also no "Grace" (wife of the original doctor) and Hugh Crain's wives died in totally different ways. These changes have changed the story too much. I do not know if the producers of this movie should be happy that Shirley Jackson is no longer on this earth or if they should ... Be sorry (if you know what I mean !!!) The hauntings she could imagine should not be neglected with !!!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me leave you a few words of the original Luke (appropriate substitution of the word "house" for "film"!): "This 'film' should be burned to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt! "My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from it.
