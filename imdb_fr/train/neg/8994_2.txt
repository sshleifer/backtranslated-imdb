This film is an excellent example of wasting large resources in a movie. John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty perform 70 minutes of racist jokes and brutal, uninspired farting. The future subversion society's network concept could have been taken to interesting extremes, but instead, just above the door, made a lame and proctological juvenile joke and stays in that vein of humor all the way. much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the hilarious film Kentucky Fried Movie. This film is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad comedy sketch movies of the 70s.
