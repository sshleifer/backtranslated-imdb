This film is just too long, much too repetitive, male nudity and sexuality being (as we say as a gay with my own collection of adult titles) much too free and useless. Much of the first third of the film could have been reduced to ten minutes and be just as effective without testing the patience (and endurance) of an audience. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie early Saturday afternoon. , with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as those without dialogue, short films, foreign films. The almost complete crowd in a theater of about 275 seats began dribbling in the first half of the film and although the vast majority remained for the "paid report" (which never happened), I never in about 14 years of attending a number of film, experimental, gay and other festivals, seeing so many people get away from a movie. <br /> <br /> This film could easily have been reduced by more than half and be as effective as it was. It could also have gone in different directions, always with a shorter operating time, and being much more efficient. <br /> <br /> In the current state of things, it is not something that can be easily recommended. desire to watch again.
