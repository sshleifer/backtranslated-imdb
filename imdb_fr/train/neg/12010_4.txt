The acronym "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film suggests the construction of a "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which will serve as an "air station" for transatlantic flights. Based on a contemporary novel by Curt Siodmark; it was filmed in German under the title "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French under the title "I.F.1 no longer responds" (1933) and in English under the name "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, technology makes nonstop ocean travel much more preferable. <br /> <br /> Stars Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (like Droste) and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) discover love and sabotage the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl realized. Mr. Veidt is very amusing to watch; but, he is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Mrs. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The youngest co-stars were the wives of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. The concept and the film have not aged well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond and Leslie Fenton
