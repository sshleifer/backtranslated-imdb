Ah, Bait. How do I hate you? Let me count the paths. 1. You are trying to be funny, but you are nerdy and unacceptable. every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to launch. 2. You are trying to be dramatic, but you are amazing; the woman exaggerates to an extreme degree, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, and is as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates intimidating someone with a gun, it does not work, does it?) A lawyer, maybe, but not a firearm. not ok.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, watching him try to engage in a dramatic and sincere dialogue is ridiculous and makes me want to get started. 3. You try to be action-packed, but on the contrary, you are boring and drag too many times. And when the action warms up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, because the scenes flicker more than those of The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseated and, again, I want to get started. 4. You are trying to be a good movie, but you have failed, you have failed, you have failed! I would prefer to walk barefoot across the Sahara with a bag filled with dried beef and no water, no sunscreen and only Meryl Streep as company. This hell would be more beautiful than a minute more spent watching everyone in Bait disrupt a silly story with Bill Gates for a villain, and do not even talk about the huge bomb that explodes in a car, Jamie's character Foxx just chased OFF A CLIFF, but still manages to escape ... kill me now, or do what it takes and promise me never to have to watch such a bad movie.
