Ok, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Spine of England.) She was killed in the first scene - that's right, guys; This show has no spine! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole in the role of Ol 'Cricket Colonel of the First World War and now the iconic lord of the mansion. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley in the role of the sweaty lady of the manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years beyond her primary age, but still so glamorous (British spelling, not mine ) enough to have a toy boy aside. Everything is fine, they have all the knowledge and consent of Colonel Cricket (their guy even comes for Christmas!) She still has enough regard for the colonel for telling his toy boy his age (what a girl!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum as a so-called toy boy, just as useless as glamorous as his embrace. Pilcher could not find any cover for him in the story, so she gave him a secret job at Circus. <br /> <br /> and finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, venerable director of the boarding school for venerable girls, serves tea in her office with a hint of deep and poignant advice for the living in the outside world just before the end of his studies. His best advice: "I only went once to Nancherrow (the Stately Home of England in England), I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow it was not not part of the real world. " Well, we can not say they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan, the time has come, your character would have run the entire series. They do not write them like that anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So with a cast and a set like this, you've reworked "Brideshead Revisited," is not it? <br /> <br /> False! They took on these one-dimensional support roles because they paid so well. After all, playing roles is one of the oldest temporary jobs (YOU name another!) <br /> <br /> First warning sign: a lot of backlighting. They go around by filming outside - "Hey, there's only sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: Leading Lady is crying a lot. When she does not cry, her eyes are wet. This is the law of love novels: Leading Lady has rosy eyes. <br /> <br /> Leading Lady will now be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third Alert Sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Nevertheless, I will give Emily Mortimer a fair price for acting with this projector in her eyes (I wonder, did they use contacts?) <br /> <br /> And finally, fourth warning sign: not on the screen the female character is "Mrs." She is either "Miss" or "Lady". <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, I still could not tell you who was chasing who and why. I can not even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> To sum up, they all lived during the Second World War without anything happening to them. <br /> <br /> OK, in the end, LL discovers that she lost her parents in the Japanese prison camps and that her sister returns to the catatonic house. Meanwhile (there is always a "during this time"), a young man who had a crush on LL (when, I do not know) returns home after a difficult time of the war and is found alive in the street near Lady of the Manor street if SHE will find it there.) The two wounded warriors are taken to be recovered at Nancherrow (Something must be "taken away" SOMEONE in these love stories!) /> <br /> Great drama.
