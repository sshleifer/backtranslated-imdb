first of all, I watched this film around midnight and that there was usually nothing but rubbish, but this film broke the record <br /> <br /> first, the main character is a terrifying old guy, yet he gets to see all the girls who come in his way, for example, he goes to a store, talks to a girl and then you see them, then there are a lot of sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity at all, I would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie said: quickly put on your clothes so we can f * ck ! <br /> Thirdly this film should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family, this film shows only sweet and naughty eroticism, it makes me wonder why these actors have agreed to play in such a trash
