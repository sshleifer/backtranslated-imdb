This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. He offers nothing in the Department of Death. One-liners are bad and should not feature in a NOES movie. Freddy is a happy kid in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is always the only thing that makes the value of it. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. Overall better than the 6th, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My rating 2/10
