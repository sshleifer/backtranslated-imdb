A wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year-old woman who desperately tries to pretend to be a 16-year-old ingenue! No exaggeration - this is the real age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film begins just before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. This television mini-series is really the most classic example of the title of this post and it is the one I mention whenever the subject is discussed. <br /> <br /> That alone makes it totally unassailable, despite the fact that it's the world's best TV drama "world" produced by television. If you have a stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you may be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum with a very good performance. <br /> <br /> I am stunned by some comments referring to the love story (pun intended). Did they watch the movie with their eyes closed? Or are they aging baby boomers who continue to surprise me with their "selective memories" and their "selective vision". I'm a boomer myself, so do not think for a second, I'm an extravagant young punk. 45 LOYA ALWAYS 45. Get used to it. Do with. Gracefully damned age. <br /> <br /> The Winds Of War could have been ... so good. How much more could we talk about this mini-series today, some 25 years later, if a REAL film location had been created to play such an important and crucial role? At the moment, with the old haggard and constant haggard distraction, this alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.
