The worst movie ever !!! Please see the real movie reviews of the pros on this movie. Check Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this movie. The comments made on this site apparently come from people with a financial interest in this film. I find the positive comments very misleading. I find it amazing how negative the reviews are so bad against this film and the positive comments sound like an Oscar speech. Do not waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie is delayed !! I can not believe a movie like this would ever be done. Why would Hollywood waste time in such a junk? This film is an attempt of nothing. I wonder what the losers would actually lose their money by producing such garbage. I went to the blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money. I did not listen and I lost my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really the "worst film ever!"
