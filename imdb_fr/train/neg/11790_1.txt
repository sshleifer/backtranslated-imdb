Deep SH .. is more like this! The eels are just drawn in the movie. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very sticky. <br /> <br /> No development of character or relationship. Scenes called "romantic" very old and predictable. An interesting idea, but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects make it a must!
