The early 90s saw the emergence of many "offbeat" and "offbeat" independent films, one of which is sub-genre semi-spiritual detective film about the desert. Others are outstanding are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn" and, to a certain extent, "Natural Born Killers". Good films such as those that spawned scraps such as "Highway 666", "Fate turns on the radio" and this incredibly surreal anti-masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". It's a comedy that targets a certain emotional tone, reaches it, but continues to go to the point of irritation. Although the worldwide pursuit of desert spirits and the casting of Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough nor hard enough to be a good crime movie and is not focused enough on laughter. to really be a comedy. . I will not blow the end, but let's just say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of the cancer of the genre. It is the dregs of indie-mania.
