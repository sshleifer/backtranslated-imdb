I do not think any player in Hollywood history has lasted as long as David Niven gave most of the faint movies he had to wear because of his incredible charm. He could play, he had an Oscar for that, but most of his material was as light as a layer of two-ply tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a good example. It's a musical and most of the time, you'll remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You will remember that they wear the costume of Scot while the film takes place in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can recall a single song, you must have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is the American actor of a musical that seems to have made its first tests in Edinburgh. She starts in the choir and runs late one day. She receives a chauffeur lift from a king of millionaires greeting cards. Everyone now assumes that she is the main source of pressure of the millionaire. Doors open like never before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven, who accompanies him, as well as the various situations engendered by this error. Cesar Romero has good moments here as a frenetic producer of this musical. <br /> <br /> In the end, Happy Go Lovely is a light and safe down that David Niven has done so much and gets tired.
