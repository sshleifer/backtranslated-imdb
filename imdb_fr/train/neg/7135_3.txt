I'm sorry to say that there is really no way, in my opinion, that an Enzo is really able to keep pace with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to weigh the advantage that the S7 possessed would simply be too great. The S7 has a weight: weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The low end S7 is much better too. Sorry, Ferrari fans, but the Saleen does it so much better. <br /> <br /> As for the other parts of this film, I must say that it is so unsatisfactory that it is pathetic. The story is too weak. The game in this lemon is worse than the daytime soaps. <br /> <br /> I can say that if it's a treatise on negative psychology, it's a jewel. This film is nothing but a glaring definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are. These are the rich punks who remove their stones while showing only traces of simulated remorse for all the innocent road users that they also cause to the wounded or to death. <br /> <br /> I can not give the movie a "1 star" rating because it did not make me leave the theater. I also think that having a beautiful blue-eyed killer as the main woman prevents her from being completely abominable ... although it is impossible for her song to place her on the cover of "Variety" . <br /> <ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skipped version of James Vanderbeek.
