(possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someone has already asked Mr. Seuss if he could get the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas movie, How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He refused them, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous 1966 Chuck Jones TV special (perhaps he also had in mind his bitter experience of writing the screenplay for The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. 1953). When the good doctor died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still refused to sell the film rights. But with the current use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Ms. Geisel has changed her mind. Universal made him a generous offer that she accepted; she has also accepted the cast of Jim Carrey as the main character. Supposedly, she was satisfied with the end result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that's one of ours. <br /> <br /> The film received a budget of $ 123,000,000 (more than the actual cost of Heaven's Gate, including adjustment for inflation). sophisticated makeup, scenography and special effects (which are somewhat undermined by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of these funds have been set aside for a better scenario than Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Scribes, which has made better use of a high budget) is returned. While the TV special lasted 26 minutes without advertising, this film tries to fill a duration of 105 minutes with more general information on the Grinch. It turns out that in his childhood he was ridiculed, including by a particularly humiliating experience, a Christmas at eight. So it turns out that everything that touches our poor Mr. Grinch is directly attributable to the Whos. The problem is that it seems to be a little 105 minutes long, with too much dead wood fouling the story. It might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a bit more ... well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and that Chuck Jones later animated was a devious fox whose subtle attempts to divert the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and his exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a noisy and hyperactive oaf and, sometimes, a thug who, when he is named "Cheermeister", angrily worships the place of the city of Whoville <br /> <br /> (I hope that the landscape has been as good as it looks). This undermines the scenario's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whoville Whos so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> Whoville's vision of Dr. Seuss was a small town populated by honest people who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The movie's Whoville is a rather noisy and crowded place of spoiled, selfish and materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensively hypocritical, as the film industry has benefited greatly from American consumerism and this film has contributed to it with a huge merchandising campaign. <br /> <br /> <br /> <The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old girl who entered this fake Santa Claus is now older and wiser, constantly questioning Who's false values ​​and trying to understand Grinch's point of view (her main scene from the original is reproduced), making it appear out of character). <br /> <br /> She seems to be the only one ever to know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, making her a completely different and more unnerving person. <br /> <br /> Those celebrating Christmas should rather accept a piece of coal in their stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this long, too long, excessively tedious, tedious, ruthless and brutal attempt to transform classic children in a feature film. This proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, <br /> manipulation and heaviness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity and heart. Universal employees should be on their knees and thank God that this stinky, $ 123 million bomb gave them $ 260 million in the domestic market, otherwise they would not be here today. Plus, it made possible Mike Myers' Cat in Hat!
