Admittedly, I am not the horror connoisseur of my partner, but a well constructed and clever film is worth it. My little problems, in short: <br /> <br /> - Dialogue often weak and sometimes incredible coming from the given character. <br /> <br /> - An unconvincing game. <br /> <br /> - Storyline never really caught fire. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriters picked up choice pieces from half a dozen mainstream movies, threw them into a kettle, did not cook enough, and tried to feed us poor slivers of the resulting mess. 'toothed. <br /> <br /> Long and short, although not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worthy to absorb one of my NetFlix rentals.
