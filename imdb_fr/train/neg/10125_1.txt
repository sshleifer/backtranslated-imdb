... that would have been what you got. <br /> <br /> Words alone can not describe how bad it is. If you have trouble falling asleep, I guarantee you will be released in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was a very good actor in the 40s - but he calls him here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that, in one scene, Batman and he had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery had been dubbed out of camera range because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than an amazing boy - in fact, he looks more like a guy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to leave to wear the big cloak. <br /> <br /> Driving a Batmobile That looks like the lot of used cars from Honest Al was sold at a lower price than the sticker price - the dynamic Duo spared no effort to hide the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car they drive - in fact, several characters have noticed the show. <br /> <br /> The acting is wood - the sets are cheap - the dialogue is horrible and if there was even a scenario, I'm sure it was read in the sense of "Batman says something here" because it seems that they are inventing as they go. <br /> <br /> The Batman Utility Belt is made of fine fabric and no apparent case to hold its gadgets - in a scene when Batman needs a life-size soldering lamp. Producers slide one as soon as the scene begins - never to be seen again. His hood is so damaging that he can not even see it anymore, and his ears are more like a mopsy that's both misguided than the discontented Easter Bunny than the bat. <br /> <br /> In a scene (I do not tell that), Batman substitutes counterfeit radioactive money that will ignite the second it will be exposed to the air as a reward for some hoods. It's radioactive so it can locate it - the reason it's so flammable is not explained. Unfortunately, the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse - we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes those boxes that seem to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out - and soon whole place burns to the ground. Thank you Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene following the Batmobile's deactivation, Batman belittles a motorist who passes in the middle of nowhere and takes his car, leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to 'worry. because if Batman crushes the car, the police will surely buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, the car left a cliff in seconds. It does not matter much to the motorist who is probably dead from an exhibition trying to get back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a tired plot with Lois Lane's clone, Vicki Vale, who is convinced that Bruce Wayne is Batman. - she must have noticed the Batmobile parked in front of Bruce's house - or maybe she saw Batman and Robin running in the densely populated suburb. <br /> <br /> Everything is bad in this series - and all, except the youngest in the audience, will want to toast on-screen. If you're looking for a bad cinema, you could not do better - if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman movies, the Adam West Batman TV series or the previous Lewis Wilson Batman series.
