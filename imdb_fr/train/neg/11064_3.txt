Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what already exists, but I feel like I have to say something. I was not exactly looking for "a party," as the saying goes, nor even "blood and guts". I have a little respect for the relatives of the victims even though I really felt that the filmmaker DO NOT DONE. -They were nameless, without face and meaningless. Just a ship for the sexual antics of the Dahmers. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think "What makes a guy a serial killer?" as well as questions about Dahmer's story, which I know very little about. People here seem to think that the film does not have to cover the events in Dahmer's story .. IE his story, what happened when he got caught, the aftereffects, etc., but C 'IS IMPORTANT! You see, I guess if you're American, you'll know all that. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about a man as it clearly was, DEMAND at least a part of the story and the actual events that are told / shown. It does not mean blood and guts, there's a way to show horrible things in a film by implication or to film intelligently without resorting to gore. Without even addressing a part of what he did (I learned more about him by reading the comments of users on this site!), The film seemed to be a void. A moment in time with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a film on the REAL Dahmer, because with its lack of direction, a VERY slow pace that never changes, a strange representation of homosexuality and the VERY regrettable lack of ANY attempt to end, this movie is POOR. I would not recommend anyone to waste time watching it. A certain 1 out of 10 (for acting!)
