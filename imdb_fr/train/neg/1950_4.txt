I grew up with Scooby (a bit of recovery from where you are). I hate nonsense, I love Daphne and I feel it's not complete without the whole gang. But it's sad, Scooby doo is a mystery that solves the mystery of comedy - not bad, the animated jap. I like "what's new", they had to give Daphne, a dangerous person, a makeover from time to time :( and try to lose the jokes about drugs * sex * many generations, but this "getting 'a hint' is shit and should not have they even tried to do something lame punk with the theme song.Now I'm going to go watch my Scooby doo DVD, where are you going to wash the dirt from this new series of my eyes
