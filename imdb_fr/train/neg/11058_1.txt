A deceptive and undeniably terrifying real-life crime movie, in which actor Jeremy Renner, a mediocre character, mumbles timidly through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was unquestionably one of the most recognizable serial killers. Dahmer, released in the studio in early 2003, is an openly snoring, boring, almost bloodless, and virtually bloodless, snoring festival, featuring a drama that never really plunges into the monstrous psyche and mind. mad of the last mass murderer. as he had the potential perfectly good to do! What she tries, however, to do for reasons unknown to me, is to arouse a kind of sympathy in the viewer by describing him as what is ultimately a lonely, socially inept, socially inept homosexual loser just to watch. for love in all the bad places unlike the cold, the calculating and depraved illness and the madman he was! All in all, the 2003 "Dahmer" is a model that real crime fans might as well avoid, because I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the worst serial killing killers of all time ! It's even more painful than other pathetic and exploitative virtual waste such as "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
