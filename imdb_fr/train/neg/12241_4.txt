This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an indisputable error in its narration. During the management of Ralphie's situation, Christopher claims to have heard of Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context, it is obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that it was Tony who had to kill Ralphie. There is no way, however, for Chris to hear about this accident. Who should have told him and when? By the time he is torn from his delirium by Tony's call, no one else has been informed. Tony knows it, which makes the situation even worse! To hear Christopher talking about Pie-O-My's death could only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself had set the fire. Given the extremely elaborate writing process described by the writers themselves on the DVD, I really wonder that none of them realized the problem. The story simply does not work like that. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of Sopranos. Otherwise, I do not care.
