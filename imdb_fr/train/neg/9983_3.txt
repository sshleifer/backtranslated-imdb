This film is a massive yawn proving that Americans do not have the joke. Even when it has already been written for them! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is a spiritual comedy of mistakes that I would call 8/10. It's not just a linguistic translation, but some absurd chains of activity are completely ignored, depriving the film of its farce originality and turning it into a cheap joke style.
