The end of this film is so horrible and obsolete that my entire film aesthetics course made me laugh. Now, most of the rest of the movie was fine. There were some unintentionally funny scenes but some really good shots and editing. Yes, Alderich is an excellent director who has directed FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane. The problem is not with direction, acting or something technical. The film is just destroyed in the third act. Why? Murders, twists, turns, and characters all revolved around nuclear matter? What did the writer smoke when he invented that? The way he just came out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. Despite all the complaints about Burton's monkey planet, the life of David Gale or Notorious, I think this is the worst ending. What a desappointment.
