I am Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First of all, I want to say that the story behind this film and the creation of the Amber Alert system is good. However, the film itself was poorly done and the acting was terrible. The major problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and Father Glenn Park. The events surrounding this part of the story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and took Nichole without any intention of hurting her. He loved her like a girl and was convinced that he was saving her from some kind of harm or neglect that he thought probably came from his mother who had not listened to him for more than 3 years during which my father was was busy with her. and raised him summarily so that his mother could frolic. The film described my father as if he was going to hurt him one way or another. The funny thing is that Nichole spent many nights sometimes in a row at my father's, while Sharon worked or did what she did. The reason we originally thought my father was violent was because he had items that could be designed as weapons in his truck. My father was a landscaper. The items they considered weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time to work. My recommendation is to take this film with a grain of salt, it's a good story and based on real events but the details of the film (at least the Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park part) are largely inaccurate and describe the failure of the film. director discover the truth by telling the story. The funny thing is that if the director had questioned one of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, he would have exposed exactly what I posted here.
