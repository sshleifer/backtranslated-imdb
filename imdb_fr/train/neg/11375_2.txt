You are speaking to me? (1987) is a very bad movie featuring a guy I've never seen before or since then, as a neighborhood guy trying to become an actor. He has a lot of trouble taxi driver to use this shtick to make it big. When he learns the hard things of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! He goes from good guy to a surf guy during the night. His friend can not believe the change (but he scores with Faith Ford and gets a great pay gig). Can this young punk keep his credibility on the street while making him big? <br /> <br /> It's a lame film that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart because of poor execution. Who knows, maybe someone will take the ball and run because the filmmakers have hit the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Bubba of Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
