For a "horror" movie made for television, the movie started very interesting. The story and the mystery of the film intrigued me a lot. But the end was a total disappointment. The film was going very well and was preparing, at least in appearance, for a very climatic end. But guess what there is no end. The film is just finished and after almost an hour and a half, the audience wonders what happened. Why have all the unanswered questions in the film gone unanswered? There was no explanation on the key points of the plot. This movie is like watching a murder and never knowing who did it. Very disappointed. This film looks like a lack of money from producers and never finished. A real bomb!
