I saw this film over the weekend and, although impressed as always by the beauty and refinement of the films produced by the Church, I am disappointed that it fell so little, by failing to inform members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions. <Br /> <br /> The film is 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith. This is not a true biopic because there is no coherent narrative. Most of the episodes are about Joseph doing good deeds, playing baseball, running and laughing with children, often very slowly. What kind of guy that Joseph was great, huh? Watch him beating mats for his wife Emma. Well, how is the carpet of her 33 plural women going? No mention is made of polygamy. A blatant omission. <br /> <br /> And it is in such omissions that the film weakens. It provides too little information and leaves critical audience members wondering WHY is Joseph being tarred and taking feathers, WHY is he thrown in jail and WHY does this crowd want to kill him? ? The highlight of the film is, of course, Joseph and Hyrum's trip to Carthage Prison (going beyond the real faces of the United Nations from the gates of Nauvoo). But we never talk about WHY. Nothing prevents Smith from repressing the newspaper Nauvoo Expositor and ordering the destruction of the press for revealing the secret teaching of polygamy. The public is left to wonder or to assume that it is simply a baseless persecution of the Church. No mention of Joseph accused of treason for declaring martial law and calling the Nauvoo militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I certainly did not expect this church-produced film to present Richard Bushman's recent biography of Joseph, Rough Stone It rolls, but I was surprised and disconcerted by the little substance presented. <br /> <br /> And worse, the substance presented was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped at me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows Joseph reading the gold plates in their two-ring binder, which were actually hidden away from the site. It is well known that Joseph translated by burying his face in his hat and casting a glance at the stone of seer. The second inaccuracy occurs in Carthage Prison, where the crowd seizes the cell. Church History reports that Joseph had six shots and even fired a few shots before jumping out the window and giving the Masonic distress signal (as reported in Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Perhaps showing the reality of the shooting would have broken the heartbreaking atmosphere that the filmmakers had created, but by omitting it, they were unfaithful to the story and did not show Joseph what it really was: handy with a gun and able to defend itself. In fact, the impression given by the movie is that Joseph was a nice guy, but also a sort of milquetoast that everyone beat, threw in jail and ended up being murdered in cold blood. He was far from that. Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardships and had trouble realizing what he believed. <br /> <br /> See the movie, but know that it's a cotton candy. Then grab your meat and potatoes as you read a copy of Smithman's biography, Rough Stone Rolling, of Bushman. PS: The films produced by churches have no merit, but a seasoned look can distinguish two familiar faces. Rick Macy is excellent. Joseph Smith, father and Bruce Newbold, beloved of Thomas, in Finding Faith in Christ, play here the ugly Methodist minister who did not show his love to a young researcher after the truth.
