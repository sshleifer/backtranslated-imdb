I am a Christian ... and I think this film is awful. <br /> <br /> This film should please no one except inflexible Christians. The message is just too much in your face. If you want to reach a wider audience, you need to be much more subtle. You can not let the father shake the Bible and take it to EVERY scene. RIDICULOUS! <br /> <br /> Bad direction. The revelation of missing persons should have been terrifying, but it was laughable. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of Ed Wood's old movies: "Oh my God, it's missing people!" This scene on the plane is just stupid. Think about it: If you found your relative's clothes next to you, you would not just say, "Oh my god, they're gone! They're gone!" and start crying and screaming. You would be in denial first ... you would not want to jump to that conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. I fell off the couch and laughed so hard. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and so distracting. It was as if the composer was in his own world marking his own movies. "Here's my chance to do a thriller", "Here's my chance to do some action!" STOP TELLING ME HOW HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL! A good score supports what is happening on the screen ... this movie needed more than one UNDER score, but it was still as present as the message. <br /> <br /> The writing was sweet. It was the same for Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was the worst: "you do not understand, it's missing people!" Brad Johnson was laughable. The two outstanding performances came from the Antichrist and the older guy (sorry, I can not remember their names). Looking at the "making of" (to answer my question "what were they thinking ???"), the producers, filmmakers and actors are deluding themselves ... they say "we are going to reach a wide audience "," Brad Johnson is amazing "and" it's like a Hollywood movie ". I came to the conclusion that they simply did not know what they were doing. <br /> <br /> I salute the efforts made. Getting the message out to a wider audience is a fantastic idea. The film is the best way to do it. Watch movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF CHRIST, even O'BROTHER, O ART ART YOU? The bottom line is that the film must be made by people who have talent and vision. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
