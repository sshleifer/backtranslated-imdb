A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies violates a woman. Two police officers shot him, then he came out of the grave because of a kind of satanic ritual rite premonstrated by a perverse heresy. The women's hunt continues with this zombie-demon. The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants to find the crazy maniac, but this will only happen with the help of the police ... <br /> <br /> A bloody mess of 65 minutes ... Zombies, doll - babies, S & M, corrupt and twisted policemen, repentant heretics seeking refuge in Jesus Christ, and three text screens at the end of the film explaining what ultimately happened to the surviving policeman (yes, we should know it!) ... Two decent knocks of landing can not save the situation. I saw the worst horror movies, but this one was pretty bad too. Recommended only for fans of the genre, very hard.
