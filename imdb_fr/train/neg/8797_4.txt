An endless frenzy of intelligent visual irony does not necessarily create an engaging movie. Half of the film "Blonde Wig" has never taken off perhaps because of too much indulgence on the part of its authors. <br /> <br /> Half Faye Wong (Faye Wong, a very playful, so Karen Carpenter is looking for) holds a lot more appeal. All the ingredients are together. However, the element of story girl / boy goes to the background of artistic intelligence. The development of character is unequal. The emotion is absent. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, the "Mung Jung Yun" by Wong Faye (Cantonese version of the hit "Dreams" of cranberry) is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin version called "Zhen Tuo". Both are on CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is on the CD of the film's soundtrack.
