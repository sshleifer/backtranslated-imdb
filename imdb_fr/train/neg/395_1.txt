When I ordered this on the Blockbuster website, I did not know it would be that bad. Who knows? I may have forgotten to take my ADD meds that day. I know that from the moment the actors got into their wetsuits, dressed in their wide necks, bell caps, and gathered hair in the late '70s, I knew that this lost jewel of the disco era was fame for the dumpster. <br /> <br /> The first revelation of the gravity of the situation was the narration of the beginning, trying to explain the cosmic forces at play to wreak havoc on the universe, forcing pornographic quality music and polyester the potential spectator. From the opening scene to the evil effects made to the "monsters" of another world, then the house jumping from one universe to another was as painfully painful as watching a primary school production of "The Monologues vagina ". <br /> <Throughout the film, the sure sign that something was going to happen was the coming of a small ship. The "ship" consisted of what looked like old pieces of VCR and camcorder and attacked everyone in its path. Of course, if it was moved slower than Bob Barker's bowels, it had threatening pencil-sized armatures and the ability to project a disturbing green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cut through the balsa wood in an hour or two (with help). <br /> <br /> We continue our journey ... As the strangeness and the bottom of the bells continue ... we discovered that they were caught in a "Space Time Warp". How can we collect this small nugget of scientific information? Because the eldest son of the male group tells his son that, in a more or less spontaneous way, he recalls memories of "how you won the big game" in front of a cup of coffee or a bottle of Coke -Cool refreshing. Was Pop a scientist? No, but he knew the horses and apparently mixed up with Einstein's string theory and theories. <br /> <br /> The recording I watched on DVD was almost bootleg quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer seemed to have been filmed on a movie screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, other than that it was really, really, really bad. (There is not enough "really" to describe it, really). <br /> <br /> I know that some people like this film and compare it to other cult classics. I have never seen this film in its original version, but even then, I think I would have reached the same conclusion: bury it quickly.
