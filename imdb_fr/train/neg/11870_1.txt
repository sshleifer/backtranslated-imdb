It's the most depressing movie I've ever seen. I first saw him as a child and even thinking about it upsets me now. I know that this was happening at a time when life was hard and these people were poor and the cultures vital. Yes, I have all that. What I find difficult to take is that I do not remember a single moment of light throughout the film. That might be true, I do not know. I'm pretty sure that the acting was great and that the direction and quality of the filming, etc., were fantastic and I know that every film can not have a happy ending, but as a family film, it is disastrous in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained with a movie. I can not emphasize enough the effects of this film on my childhood. I spoke about it recently and all the sad memories came back. I think that all efforts would be made available to Prozac, except those who are heartless.
