It's a film that relies solely on the controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed. That's it. The dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of the "scenes of sex" is absolutely absent. The role play and the dialogue the high school students, but the subject is intended for an adult audience. It is a film without gut and shallow. It could have been better if he had had a story and more drama. Ah, and on top of that, one last thing: why are interior monologues used so excessively? It looks so cheap. All in all, it's an embarrassing film for Romanian cinema, as well as for an adult audience, who is trying to watch it. I know that means are rare, but it's not always an excuse for a flop film to start. use good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not act!
