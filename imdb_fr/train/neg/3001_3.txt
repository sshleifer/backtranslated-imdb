Slaughter High tells the vengeance story of a nerdy guy with one of the coldest and coldest jokes in film history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening, the film went straight to hell. A very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre cuts and a last half-hour that sucked on a whole new level of sucking. The guy who played the nerd actually committed suicide shortly after the release of the movie. If you want to rent the movie, stop it after the prank and remember, choose life.
