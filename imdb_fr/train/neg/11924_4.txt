RUN ... do not go away from this movie !!!!! Aimed at very young children, this film will bore you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90s raised the bar, this film simply lowered it. The pace is slow and the monster fights are good, but rarely seen. This film made me go dry in the cat box. Just a very mediocre offer after a phenomenal series of the 90s. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons why 90s Gamera fans will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a drama that follows a child trying to cope with the death of his mother and who fears losing his baby Gamera in a fight after learning that his father had seen him die the adult Gamera. <br /> <br /> You see adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the movie. He gets his ass kicked by some Gyaos and self-destruct ??? He looks old and lethargic. Plus, it does not look like any gamera you've ever seen. His costume looked cheap and rushed. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see through the movie looks like a Pok√©mon. Big eyes and cute ... it will remind you Godzilla's baby Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the rhythm of watching a NASCAR race for 3 hours with rain. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and no one was happy with the slowness of this movie. I saw an SUV filled with fat people riding a mountain road faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie has very little kaiju time on the screen. Final Wars had a lot more, in fact, and better fights than short duration. <br /> <br /> 5. The children take the title role. The theme of the friend of all the children and the mediocre writing killed the original series of Gamera in the 1970s and the story is repeated in the 2000s. The most successful films of Gamera have abandoned the atmosphere of Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why go back to a missed formula? This was supposed to be a new trilogy and the bad sales of tickets killed all hope that this story continues (thank god). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost his iconic roar. He now looks like an elephant with strep throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This film could produce a new Olympic event ... Imagine a relay race that involves putting very young children at risk. You must see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yes, you send their children to a Kaiju combat zone. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but lower than those of a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was to show the baby's Gamera fly, the size of an apple. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows. It is like a cross between AND, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Congratulations if you know the 3 references. <br /> <br /> Rent at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series.
