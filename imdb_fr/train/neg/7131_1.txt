I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and tear them up for their entire duration. Then there are obnoxious movies like this one. Redline is not just a bad movie, but a telltale sign that the American film industry may have to please, at least for the viewer, at least one script replay before funding a film. <br /> <br /> If a stereotype took a shit, this movie will follow. The scenario is unbearable and the acting is laughable. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may have the worst screen chemistry I've seen in a while, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and hit with a bag of oranges until that they change their job as street vendors, something they can legitimately claim). Moreover, the way Angus Macfadyen was convinced to make this film is so far from me that I can not even think of an analogy. I am his loyal fan, but that led me to question him. <br /> <br /> In summary. Many people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough about who they are, you're a bigger person than me), so much so that it turns violent (I guess). The film is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, in the sense that it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that does not suit human ears. This film is essentially a commercial advertisement for the first half of the car and an action film indecipherable for the rest, it must be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I would like to find a positive aspect to this action. film, and I think that's because the credits end up rolling. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if it was YOU singing these two songs in this movie, then you are a hack and I hope that old age will delight you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you are renting this movie for a laughable experience, listen to the lyrics of the great Nadia Bjorlin songs.
