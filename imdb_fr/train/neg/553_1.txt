After waiting impatiently for the end, I must say that I wish I had not joined the entire series at the start. The last episode was against the previous seven years. He ruined everything. The trip lasted 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... say, only seven years. Why seven? Why not one? Or nothing? Why not avoid all the adventure? The crew members were dying throughout the trip. Why does she want to save Seven of Nine only? The others do not matter or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew declares that going home is not really the most important thing in their eyes. As they say, "the trip is more important than the destination". Unbelievable. And at the final stage, they are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst end of all time.
