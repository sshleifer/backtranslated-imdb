Frank Capra's creativity had to be exhausted by the time he made this film. Although there are some lovely moments and many wonderful performers, Capra does not just recycle the script but also many sequences from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is downright bad quality. It is understandable that he reuses the images of the horse race, which is exciting. But he uses entire scenes of dialogue with minor actors, then brings back these actors and apparently expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last appearances, skip it and watch Broadway Bill instead.
