Where to start ... Oh yes, Message to the wicked: When you find for the first time the person you followed (to kill) who witnessed a crime you committed, do not waste time talking to him for her to have another chance to go out. Message to the victim: When the hooligans talk and talk, take this opportunity to "RUN AWAY", do not sit there and do not look at them until you hear a noise. Message to the director: If someone is 5 or 10 minutes ahead in a vehicle or on foot, you can not have the bad guys on the heels or the bumper right away! time and movement do not work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) men to give herself the power to leave an abusive relationship at home.
