The main complaint with this film is the fact that I can not say who is who. No racism wanted, but these Asians are all alike! I can tell the story a little, but damn it, that's about it. The identities of peoples are not a mystery, if they were a mystery, I would care about them. Instead, I did not leave the screen as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide shots and silent and emotionless faces occupy this film. Heck is boring, not only do I not know these people, but they are just sitting there. <br /> <br /> The production is typically Chinese, John Woo, a terrible video with stained scenes. It looks slightly better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie.) You'd think that with a decent budget, you could at least make it look like Hollywood in the '90s. did not know that the Chinese had these art-house beatniks.
