I'm not sure how to begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad movies because they are often the most entertaining. I like bad effects, bad performance, bad music and inept direction. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this movie had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were incredibly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Among the scenes to watch are the Thunderchild, the woman crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the sinking of the train ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the positive side, some scenes of the alien walkers are well done. <br /> <br /> The acting game was about as bad as it could have been, having been based directly on H.G. Wells' book. To have such a good source material, it's almost as if the actors were trying to be so exciting to make it funny. And then there's the mustache ... the most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half of the movie contains a role. The rest are characters who wander in plans of effects aimless and poorly rendered. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice for inept directors. With the use of different color filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds, even for interior scenes, the bad projection in green, I find it amazing to see how this man has already gotten permission to make a film. I do not imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into such a bad movie. Well done, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to all those who are thinking of watching this movie is doing what I did: having friends who like bad movies, drinking, playing poker while watching them, continuing to drink and maybe do it all the way. This is an excellent bad movie, so have fun and laugh ridiculously with this disaster.
