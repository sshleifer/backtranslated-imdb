How can you say that a horror movie is terrible? when you can not stop laughing of course! The plot has been well covered by other critics, so I'm going to add some hilarity to it all. <br /> <br /> Some critics have placed the site in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in a random Pacific island. Where does this happen, it seems like a mystery. The cannibal tribe is made up of a pair of black women, black men and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa who beats drums ... the god of the devil is a big black man with very dark pink eyes. <Br /> <br /> One of the "weirdest" moments of the film is when "Pablito" finds his partner hanging from a tree covered with what appears to be an orange substance that I suppose to be blood, begins to scream for minutes over and over (that's actually funny), then her partner's head falls to the ground and "Pablito" kicks him for what I suppose to be "shit do not joke" and the eyes actually move ... <br /> <br /> But, of course, the "monster" is gone when you realize that the eyes have moved because the movie is just bad ... <br /> <br /> I had not laughed like that for a long time, and I definitely recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... grab a crate of beer and start watching this movie, you will love it! If you are looking for a real horror movie or gore, do not worry.
