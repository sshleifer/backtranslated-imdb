My roommate rented this movie the other night and we watched it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually positive, as the entire film is shot in this post-MTV colored and grainy texture. Quick sequences, cold angles, radical camera movements - for now, you feel like you're about to watch another "Snatch", for the moment .... <br /> <br /> intrigue really begins to unfold, one begins to feel as if an amphetamine overdoses. things just do not make sense anymore. I do not want to ruin the pleasure of watching it by showing some scenes, but again, the movie is so bad that it's better NOT to watch it. <br /> <br /> First, you think it's a crime story told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. FALSE. This conversation does not provide any coherent story. Rather, Domino's lesbian about Lucy Liu's character during the second part of the film plunges the audience into even greater confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it might be a movie about a rich girl. but dysfunctional background that has become a tough bounty hunter. In any case, this is the message conveyed by the first scenes. But after that, the question of Domino's character is entirely lost to the criminal conspiracy. In short, NO, it's NOT a movie about the character of Domino. <br /> <br /> So, I thought: this is probably the story of a robbery. A bloody flight. 10 million missing, bounty hunters pursue suspected thieves, mafia children are executed, hands are kidnapped, Domino tries to understand why, this time, they do not receive bonus certificates, etc. But soon, this impression is dispelled plot. <br /> <br /> This time, we are confronted with the sad story of an obese African-American woman who simulates the local MVD driver's license and, at the age of 28, finds herself the youngest daughter of her grandmother. Lateesha plays in Jerry Springer's show, tries to make a new racial theory of delirium known and at the same time tries to find money for his sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main plot? Urgh, well, nobody knows. Except that the director had to explain to the public where the bounty hunters would set their collection fee of 300 000. <br /> <br /> Then, at some point, you start thinking: "Oh, this is of our society and how the media is distorting things. " There is a reality TV crew that walks around with bounty hunters and runs violent footage. Bounty hunters are also struggling with a host of Hollywood actors who complain all the time about being smashed and letting themselves be dragged along by too many crime scenes. But NO, it's not a movie about the media, they appear sporadically throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other subplots: the Afghan fool, who wants to liberate Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the episode of mescaline, FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> Can everything mentioned above be packed in a 2-hour film? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear: it's a mess!
