I do not even want to call this thing a movie - it's a movie that should not have won a prize. The acting was horrible, as were the idiotic scenarios. This is exactly the kind of film that most people think is going to the NRI audience, but that it is actually hated abroad for its embarrassment and for the overwhelming feeling of trying all over the world. movie. <br /> <br /> I find it odd that so many actors in the English language have so much trouble acting so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all those English phrases thrown in a film, in Hindi and in the regional cinema, for nice arguments. There are few Indian films in which English seems quite authentic - Being Cyrus was recent. Although it was not a good film, it was a good movie and the language did not seem "dressed". <br /> <br /> I am ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-pleasant parts of this garbage were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background note. Apart from that, do not even waste your time with this movie.
