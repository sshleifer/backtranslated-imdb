I bought this film last weekend at my local movie gallery. It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more, so I chose this one. Horrible mistake. The box reads as if it would be a very good movie. Well, it starts as if this movie was going to be great. For about 5 minutes, that's it. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who was killed while trying to save her son-in-law, Jack, from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a breeder whose inhabitants are scared. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposed to be afraid of this bull and goes hunting to find him. It was the first 5 minutes, that's fine. What follows will only get worse 100 times. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to make a good trip to the acid or something because nothing else made sense. Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary driving him by car. I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin type Mary. You know, the mother of Jesus. But, who knows, I could not make the head or the tail. When they run, we see villains, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, and so on. Needless to say, I took the film again and exchanged it for something else. It's horrible, I tell you, horrible. And, there is absolutely no bullfighting in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the film. I hope I helped other people avoid wasting their time on this movie.
