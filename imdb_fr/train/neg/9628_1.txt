It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The DVD was given to me free of charge with an order that I put online for articles that are not related to the DVD. <br /> <br /> No wonder they were distributed, no one can certainly part with money for this story. <br /> <How some critics can say they found the hilarious beggar belief, the person who included it in the five worst movies in the world put it on the table. <br /> <br /> How a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could be involved in this garbage is amazing. Generally, the toilet humor and badly done. <br /> <br /> Anyone wishing to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.
