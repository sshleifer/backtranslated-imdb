We rented five movies for the New Year's weekend and watched this one first. All I can say is that there was no other place to go than this one after looking at this one. It was useless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's script had to be easy to write - just make two words all three to say a cursed word. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in one role, but the movie has nothing else to recommend.
