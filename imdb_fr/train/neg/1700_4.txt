In cinema, I think it should be more than art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on the screen. This short film by David Lynch tells a story, but not much. I felt it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. It's a good movie but there is nothing else. As I said before, I'm a big fan of David Lynch but I'm frustrated with some of his work because I do not see the need. This is certainly the least I have liked so far, but I know he still has a lot of talent and I can not wait to see what he has in store for the future. If you like Lynch, take a look at it, but do not be surprised if you do not like it a lot.
