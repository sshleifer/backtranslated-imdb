This is perhaps the worst fencing film, sword fighting ever made. This is not only because the sports fencing is poor, but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to launch a semi-nude sex scene and, later, a group supposed to dance around 'a fencing scene in the fencing club, I guess to maintain the interest of the public. What a waste of the talents of F. Murray Abraham. You're better served with exaggerated fanatical movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, everything bassist Basil Rathbone. As a scribe, I recognize that it is almost impossible to capture fencing as a film sport, but if that happens, it must have cooler, better-drawn characters and a deeper plot.
