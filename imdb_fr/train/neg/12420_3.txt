There is simply not enough here. There are some fun places, but not really enough. I was very disappointed because I like stupid movies. I was expecting it to be a hidden gem. IT WAS NOT. It was a hidden shit. <br /> <br /> During the whole time I was watching, I said to myself, "Damn, I could do better than that and I'm a moron". Do not believe the few good reviews. I was sucked by them. At no time did I laugh loudly. Maybe it was funny or avant-garde in 1987, but the man fell flat today This movie had promised, it just did not deliver. Maybe if they rewrote it a few more times. I can not blame the actors. They were not the best, but they just did not have much to work on. This film failed because of a worn writing. KIND disappointed.
