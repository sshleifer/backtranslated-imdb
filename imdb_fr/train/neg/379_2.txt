The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture capable of producing such complex and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians can not produce a single film that would exceed the level of filthy filth that this film represents so perfectly. It's Bollywood at its best / worst, honestly, I can not tell the difference. Nauseating kitsch clich√©s at all levels, stories, situations, dialogues, music and choreographies. Frankly, you must be late to take advantage of it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to leave because I could not stand it anymore. The only quality that redeems the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
