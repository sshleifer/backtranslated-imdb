Turkish cinema has a big problem. The directors are not interested in world cinema. They are local and folk, but want to be international. This gives kitsch results such as this movie. <br /> <br /> The film contains jokes translated from Turkish into Spanish and have no meaning for a non-Turkish audience. Even for the Turkish public after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, have a more serious acting game than average. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing includes Cuba. Cuba is therefore considered a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Loss of money, waste of time.
