Uta Hagen's "respect for acting" is the reference work of many university theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentation approach and the representation approach. In the Presentation approach, the actor focuses on making the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements of the actor's life. In the representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion thanks to a high degree of control of movement and sound. <br /> <br /> The representational approach of the action was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was created. . The British theater has a long history of this style of actor, and Olivier could be considered the ultimate king of the school of representation. <br /> <br /> The weather has not been good for this acting school or for this film. Almost all actors who work today use a presentation approach. For the modern eye, Olivier's stylized presentation is highly articulate, heavy, rigid and on stilts. Instead of creating a hamlet in internal conflict, Olivier fabricated the melancholy Dane, a horn of his own importance and decadent - an actor style that would have worn well on the backs of London's greatest theaters, but is far too fierce for take away a modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> And so the film cracks needlessly today. Olivier's tendency to e-nonunation makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally amusing: "Instead, you must acquire and obtain a temperament that could give him ... Sweetness!" Instead of crying when meeting his father's ghost (as any actor would do), Olivier's students let themselves be blinded by the bright fill lights. a good try at the queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41 and she was 26). The other actors in this film have no chance of finding anything else important, given the tendency of Olivier to want to keep it! the camera! on him! at all! time! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearian theater actor who lacked the confidence to represent a breakable and imperfect hamlet, but instead chose to represent a sort of Elizabethan megaphone. Final analysis: "I would like such a guy to be whipped for doing Termagant, he exceeds Herod: pray, avoid him."
