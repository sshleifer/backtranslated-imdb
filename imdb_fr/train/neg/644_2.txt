We all wondered, "Why do not they redo slasher movies that were only acceptable instead of redoing those that were already excellent, that way, they can only make it better?" Well with Prom Night they did Jamie Lee Curtis' mean but trashy 80s fun movie and made it even worse. This is a slasher painting by numbers that clearly tries to attract young teens (so no violence, etc.), the knife in this slasher film is blunt. The director spends so much time trying to give the rather seductive assassin a rather scary look. Actors who include Britney Snow (who was superb in Hairspray) do their best, but the material does not give them anything to do except pouting and looking scared.More annoying is the way the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but will not see it). It also seems that the only place where the knife in this film was worked was in the editing room since the film seems to have been slaughtered (I suppose nothing very scary ended up on the floor of the room. assembly so as not to frighten children). Pay the money from Americans who send this film to number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher movies are very fun, but in the case of Prom Nights, it made me want to download the original. I saw more frightening episodes of OC and Dawsons Creek.
