Fifteen years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially the young ones. When I was a 3-year-old living in the Philippines, I watched this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 over there). When the movie was released in 1995, everything was shocked and impressed when I watched it with my father and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Ranger material (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and stuffed Ranger toys). I even played video games and only liked one ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. Anyway, it's the show that paved the way for my interest in robot series (especially animated series such as "Gundam"). Now that I'm 18, I would like to think that this show is rather lame for me. To prove it, I made a trip to the past by buying a collection of DVDs containing 2 series containing "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Ranger Movie" and watched them. I was like, "Ugh, it's awful, just another junk in the attic for me." For all members of my generation, this is NOT a show you would like to see again and again. I'm not saying leave it for the rest of your life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing now, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam", "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots), or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that are the basis of "Power Rangers" .
