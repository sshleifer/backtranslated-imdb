In this paranoid style boiler, our reporter is fighting against embarrassing authorities, duplicous colleagues, rogue UFO snipers and silent and furtive aliens. (Even though he is able to mentally control and zap objects from a distance, it takes three to manage a control panel of about two dozen buttons.) The script moves from event to event , leaving puzzles in abundance. Why did extraterrestrials blind the dog? Why do they fry the soldiers with radiation while they only patrol an empty landing site? And what space dudes that are worth their moon cheese first remove the ugly photographer instead of his model? Curious minds want to know! Screenwriter-director Mario Gariazzo apparently studied his subject by crushing a pile of UFO-themed tabloids as he played a double film of Sunn Classics. (The closing screen says it's based on real events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some people may feel scorched by the abrupt finale, but they should still please the plot maneuvers.
