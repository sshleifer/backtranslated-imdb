I loved the first two movies, but this film was a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I still wonder why they did this horrible film. The thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car, which can go to another house is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were so funny, but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not so funny. Believe me, this movie is a waste of time.
