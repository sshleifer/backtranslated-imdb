I grew up with Scooby Doo, where are you, and I still love him. This is one of my favorite drawings with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. Although this show is good for children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect like Scooby and Shaggy), the melody of the theme is tolerable and the animation is pleasant. However it is rather disappointing. Scrappy does not bother me normally, but when he seems to be like the main character, it quickly becomes annoying. Complete with the slogan Puppy Power, Scrappy is a little more annoying than usual. In addition, half of the gang disappeared after the first year, which did not seem to be Scooby Doo. And the jokes and stories were usually lame and unoriginal, with little chasing monsters or unmasking the bad guys. In summary, not as bad as Shaggy, Scooby Doo: get a clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, the voices, the melody and the fact that it's nice for the kids. Bethany Cox
