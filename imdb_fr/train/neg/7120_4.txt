I saw this movie for the first time on MST3K. And even though I laughed at these jokes, I do not particularly think that this movie was so bad. Of course, it was a bit difficult to understand, it's a seemingly low budget, but the scenario was very similar to Hitchcock's and I can honestly say that when I watched the non-MST3K version, I was really amused. This film claims a remake in Hollywood.
