where is it a bird? It's an airplane? No, look ... it's a disaster! or: no need to look in the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer was trying to make a titanic movie like a movie to break the box office record, he would fail. The SR structure can not do that, the dark and restrained color scheme (I would call it "wishi-washi"), the usual boring dialogues, the clown with the advanced extraterrestrial technology, the missing pleasure and the magic, etc. completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing about a character like Superman is that he is a superhero. It's the heart, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Love trouble and a depressed Supersoftie sadly lost can only be a facet in a long Superman movie of 2:40, not all the time. </ br /> Because then it's no longer a superman or superhero movie. It's like a (and in this case a very bad and boring) social study, where every 30 minutes a person steals. <br /> <br /> It's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Skywalker is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaction and the most important thing, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to make a love drama with a soul long 2:40 about people lost and lost? Then take the normal human characters and make a yentl remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman is coming back. And then, supersadlysoftie stands at the door. <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but a bad movie can not do that. Do not give up, they plan a sequel ... <br /> <br /> Next time, the singer (and Warner Brothers), make a movie of superheroes, not a depressive super-depressive soap, or the never mind. A superhero movie is a colorful fantasy full of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This film is like a box of very cheap chocolate with a great cover. Yes, technically, there are all sorts of things, yes, there are a lot of small discussions, there are some jokes, action scenes, etc., but the only common element to all these worst pieces is their quality poor. <It's nothing more than an extremely boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous distribution strategy can make sequels in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter, she looks 19 years old. Superman was already in five years. He slept with her 6 years ago. to spend a night with superman "Warner Brothers is too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, he plays a bit of wood, but the whole film is made of wood, so ... The temporary belongings were marsden and sometimes posey.The rest, forget it.Even spacious, it's not his land. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder behaved so easily, with fun. difference. <br /> <br /> The poses of Jesus at the end are as ridiculous.What should it be? The problem here is that they mean that serious, not like a joke The next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises like Jesus or angels, or they speak directly to God, why not, superheroes who save lives every day, so at least one conversation with god a week should be possible ... Oh my god. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was not the real movie announced, but rather that of a strange united to dull parallel. <br /> <br /> For the Warner brothers, this superlime depressive film will probably be the biggest disaster in history. Not only because of the money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it was to create and convey messages or feelings, but to show people alone, lost and, unfortunately, is not new and thousands of movies or TV series have done better, in very old or new as magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this flying superwoman, sorry, superman of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, it's just nothing. In fact, it's even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion of cinema (comic / superheroes) and steals three hours of our life. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilla's little brother. (Very angry and green like the hulk.)
