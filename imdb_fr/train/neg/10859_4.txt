It's another one of the many B-movies that are not labeled as a film noir in the hope of generating interest in something that does not. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. The game of three pellets is wooden. I imagine John Dall was going to the film industry, but someone realized that he had little talent and ended up working on television. Lee J Cobb, who is generally formidable, can not go beyond the poor scenario and direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but fails to convince viewers. The film contains two of the strangest cars I've ever seen, one in which John Dall attacks Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. The DVD transfer is typical Alpha.
