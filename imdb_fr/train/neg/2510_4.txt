This TV movie tells the story of the extrovert Frannie, who suddenly returned to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but was not aware of her mother's death. Her sister runs the family home but plans to sell it and move in with her new husband. Frannie is strongly opposed to this idea and is committed to preserving the family's childhood by getting a job and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> The handsome Ruben arrives and the two quickly fall in love (like you). and it's from that moment that I have somehow lost interest ... <br /> <br /> Farrah Fawcett is not limited to her fair hair and her appearance. She can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it's certainly proven here as well as some of her previous efforts like Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a superb performance by the legendary Charlie's Angel. <br /> <br /> Silk Hope is the kind of movie that never fears its cheap and cheerful TV picture, and you know the budget was limited, but it was not the worst movie of all time. The positive aspects are there. you just have to find them.
