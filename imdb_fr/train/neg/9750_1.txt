The film, a universal output of a Protelco-MLC production, is a boring narrative of the theory of the decomposition of the molecular structure of an object, captured in a cell in the form of "pure energy", then returned entirely to a "target area." There is no explanation WHY this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (portrayed by pock-mock actor Bryant Haliday, "Devil Doll") thinks it's something to dedicate, as well as his assistants Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell Ronald Allen), lives at. <br /> <br /> In a previous experiment noted by the Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine failing due to sabotage, he was "projected" by his secretary, Sheila ( Tracey Crisp), for revenge. Of course, she jokes and comes out like a "roast pork" with the power to electrocute people. <br /> <br /> With this power regained, he manages to zap Cockney's idiots, a security officer named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his laboratory chief, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He is also able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> Finally, despite Hill and Mitchell's attempts to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. Overall, a movie totally useless and without message. <br /> <br /> It's also one of the most depressing color films you'll ever see.
