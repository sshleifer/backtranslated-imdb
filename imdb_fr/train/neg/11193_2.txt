Okay, I did not have great expectations, but this movie was coming down in depths that I could not imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot involved a priest of an obscure order of 2 members investigating the death of the founder. of order by a Sin Eater. The Sin Eater allows Catholics to obtain salvation outside the authority of the Church and is another immortal in the bored film. No matter how meaningless it has been since then, a Baptist could give you salvation .... we'll move on. <br /> <br /> I will present the plot without saying too much: the priest goes to Rome with his friend to invest. He takes with him a mental patient (I do not do that) who shot at him during an excorism and who loves him (no licks are explained to him), an Irish priest drunk and Peter Weller cardinal. They arrive in Rome, find terrifying children who do nothing in the film, meet an anti-pope S & M bondage that the drunken Irishman knows (not explained) and who gives information by killing people (oh, BTW he's a bad guy so he has an industrial soundtrack / techno) and then ... uh, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot meanders. Heath shivers with the Sin Eater, goes to New York with the Sin Eater for one night, then there are other things going on, then (off camera) the anti-pope falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> About An hour after the movie starts, you really wonder if something has happened. In the end, something has happened, but you are not at all sure of its importance and, as most dramas take place before the movei, or you feel cheated, you really feel deceived.
