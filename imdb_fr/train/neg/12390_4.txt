After seeing a heavily censored version of this film on TV a few years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised it was more believable and well played than I remembered, but one thing really came out. I think other commentators also mentioned it, namely: what exactly is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character? Has he ever raped other victims? Is he completely psychotic or "average" sociopath? How did he hope to get away with his attack on the younger sister? Is this character credible at all, or is it simply a matter of more substance? He seems almost simultaneously to be an incredibly believable character and too crazy to be able to keep a teaching position that puts him in touch with vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terribly convincing. The film occupies a delicate position between a real exploitation and a rather serious treatment of the subject, without settling thoroughly in one or the other mode. Not the worst movie of all time, but not very good either.
