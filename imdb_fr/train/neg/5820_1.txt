This movie is probably the worst film I have ever seen. I study French at university and I understood the whole dialogue. The language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is really difficult to sympathize with one of the characters described in the film. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I suppose there is no professional director or screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Even though I rated it 1 out of 10, it probably does not deserve such a bad rating. It is simply a futile effort to lower its current overall score of 7.3 to a more realistic level. Maybe the score of 4.3 would be fairer because the movie is a real 100-minute event that you will never find. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure a student is breaking his nut to make a film twice as long and much longer. However, if you want to join the bandwagon that seems to revolve around IMDb, you might as well give "Lost in Translation" a 10 too.
