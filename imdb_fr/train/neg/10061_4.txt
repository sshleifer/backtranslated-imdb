"The curse of Frankenstein" faithfully sticks to the story of Mary Shelley for a word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were really good. The tragedy of the creature that destroyed Frankenstein's family was completely excised and replaced by ... nothing. The heart and the moral center of history have disappeared. It does not help that Frankenstein is an accomplice murderer and sneaky; he deserves all he has. The plot is essentially a shallow checklist of Frankenstein snapshots. Even taken on its own terms, it is a waste: a bland and disjointed film featuring a creature who looks boring with a haircut cut in pudding. As this is the first of Hammer's horror movies directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in the history of horror is assured. But it's shit.
