This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever wasted money on! The plot is, uh, sorry, did I say there was a plot? The most scary moment was when ..., Nope can not think of one! The best special effect that had hidden me under the bedspreads was ..., nobody can think of one for that either. You knew who the killer was from the beginning. The whole movie was nothing scary, in fact, the only two vaguely interesting elements were when you saw the little sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw nurse Toppan take off. This movie should be viewed only to get an idea of ​​what NOT to do a horror movie !!!
