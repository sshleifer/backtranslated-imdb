It hurts me to write such a scathing critique, but by not doing so, I just encourage these people. First of all, the fact that a film is made with a small budget does not make it automatically good or endearing. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only realization of the film in the sense that it avoided the wasting of large sums of money on a horse with a leg shit. Have you ever seen a comedy at the theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and say, "What are the dickens?" Well, even those pussies did not laugh. Things got so bad in the middle of the road, my cat took his first bath. It's not a film, it's children ... no monkeys creating images that will leave you wanting to move to France. I have to go, there is a clown at my door .............
