This is one of those terrible, sex-oriented B movies that could not have been played anywhere near a theater. Women run dressed in slightly dressed "rabbit" outfits. An extremely fat woman is the victim of many tasteless jokes. Tom's brother), that the man wants to be "asked". Hanks is actually pretty good, but this movie is not going anywhere and makes no sense. One has to wonder why this was even done? Nevertheless, because of Hank's performance and some entertaining moments (but no more than a few), he received a stellar "2". I think, however, that I was fine.
