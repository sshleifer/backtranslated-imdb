Today, I wrote this review angry at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days in our country. 911 changed everything. This changed our perception of security. This has changed our understanding of the evil of man and of humanity. More importantly and devastatingly, it has changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I can not emphasize how much I am utterly repelled, disillusioned and angry at the careless and blatant ignorance of Hollywood that seeks to make a lucrative profit out of death and death. destruction. This film and his ilk are sure to spark controversy among moviegoers and critics alike. very surely be taken up by the traditional press. Hollywood has fallen to a new minimum. Even lower than the low bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and cruelty. Behind all this is Uwe Boll. I am very angry with this movie. How dare they disrespect the memory of the families of those who have been lost? How dare they make fun of the lives of brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the towers condemned on that fatal day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the fog of a gloomy and tired world after 9/11?!?!?! How dare they? <br /> <br /> To those who have the nerve to think even to see this morally frightful tragedy, I say it with a heavy heart of all my strengths: remember. Think back to this day and ask yourself if you are a healthy person and morally. Think back to this day, ask yourself if this movie is a shame and a disgrace to the lives lost that day. Think back to this day of the outcry of families of loved ones. Rethink lives lost on both counts. Rethink the carnage that caused the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think about it. Remember. Respect the memories of lives lost on 911 by not seeing this movie at all.
