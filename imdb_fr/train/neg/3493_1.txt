I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Simply terrible. I like the movies of Shaw Bros. (I am now convinced that these top 10 lists are all cut-and-paste tasks.) First, there is virtually no action in the movie. Most of the film is about the plot, which is an amazing feat, because at best it is thin. And the action itself may have been impressive in 1978, but it's a routine by today's standards. Special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they ship is terrible; the photo is appalling and it is not even improved in 16: 9 format.
