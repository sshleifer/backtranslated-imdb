In appearance, this is a Z class horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, 've got it often <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading this book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You have entered here, you can now get away with it!" (after driving a man to the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what they sing) <br /> <br /> - it's not clear what this movie did to the time for post-structuralism, is in fact, or if it's just bad film. The acting is atrocious, but I know some actors, so they block it? <br /> <br /> An old house, obviously carved with a contemporary home, is the scene of murder. A (bad) film is made on the field and the story is replayed again.
