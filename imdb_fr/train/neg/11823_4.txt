TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS <br /> <br /> Format: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> At the end of the 19th century in England, the young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to Rugby Public School where he experiences the reforms of a new radical school principal (Stephen Fry) and resists the school bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> Already undergoing many adaptations to the screen - notably the top 1951 version of Gordon Parry - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel is being treated at the beginning of the 21st century, with the kind Authorized by screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (Where the Heart Is) and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is quite pleasant and observable, but it is also quite sober and boring, distinguished only by Fry's sincere performance as a new director determined to sweep away some of the most dubious 'traditions' of the school, and by Introducing a New Potential Star into 14-year-old Pettyfer is a talented child with effortless charm and a beautiful, bright look that should take him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, it is the typical British TV feed, the type of content preferred by leaders wanting to fill the calendars with a product of "prestige", even the most harmless. The British publication 'Radio Times' described it as "delicately bizarre" and raised a questioning eyebrow on "all this noisiness and brutality and a fine villain, ugly murderer, torturing the lives of nice young boys". Enough.
