I had this movie because I was working in a movie store so I got free rentals. He came in, and the cover made him look good. Hot chick, carrying a gun, okay, I'll check. <br /> <br /> Oh man, bad shot. It was so horrible, I spent half the movie watching in advance to get to nudity, which was minimal. I think that may be three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Cheesy dialogue, shitty violence, poor character excuses. I feel bad about dropping this film, because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but it was the same for "Clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
