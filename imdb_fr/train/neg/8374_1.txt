What's the point of seeing a movie like this? It's painful and embarrassing, not even in a way that allows you to make fun of him. <br /> <br /> Movies like "Little Man" are depressing me. They represent the film at its best. This film was shot for a group of boys aged 18-24 who, he hoped, would find out on the night of the first night before the message revealed how terrible it was, so the film could quickly recover investment. <br /> <br /> A hundred or so filmmakers with big ideas would probably not have been able to make their films, because resources were allocated to the realization of this puddle of vomiting. <br /> <br /> Grade: F
