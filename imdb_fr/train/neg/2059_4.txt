A call girl goes to murder and becomes the next target of the killer. The director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious trajectory: his camera travels through the corners of a museum (after having thought a long time about a monkey painting), divides himself into a split screen for artistic purposes, practically abandoning his plot with a sequence (again on split screen) where two characters are watching a transsexual TV show and are staging their (first) finale in a torrential rainstorm. "Dressed To Kill" is exhausting, mainly because it asks us to swallow so much and give nothing substantial. Most of the actors (with the exception of the young Keith Gordon) are mediocre and the (second) final is a scam of "Carrie" from De Palma - not to mention "Psycho". The explanation of dirty acts plays like a parody of Hitchcock, not a tribute. Elegant in a spirit of cold steel, the final results are clearly half-cooked. ** from ****
