Something that really does not fit into Al Gore's theory (and his followers) is about "consensus". <br /> <br /> If there is such a consensus, why the "believers" "In almighty global warming, feel the irrepressible urge to intimidate anyone who questions them. <br /> <br /> Why is a person who does not respect the rule of global warming be accused of being stupid? or on the payroll of oil companies (apparently, being a professional researcher on global warming does not mean you are on the payroll of this wonderful world ...) Why is it so necessary to tell everyone how is the whole question settled, when is it the very nature of science to question hypotheses honestly? For ideas on answering these questions, read Prey's famous oilman Michael Crichton ... oh, wait, he's rich and does not appear on the oil companies' payroll. He simply took a huge career risk by not respecting the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshipers and told the truth while he was looking for it. By the way, did you know that compliance with the Kyoto protocol would not lower temperatures, according to its own sponsors? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure to avoid the fear of not touching every penny of the environmental lobby if he decided to run again. <br /> <br /> So who is a stooge ...?
