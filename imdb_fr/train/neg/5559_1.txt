This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The Avengers have held this dubious honor ?? but not more. The game in "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and has only been overshadowed by the plot. This film is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. He does not know if he wants to be an S & M movie or a very bad thriller. Look only under extreme intoxication or if you are bedridden and need a distraction of leather. This script should be reworked in a porn, it would not take much effort and would have a longer life. A porn, even a bad porn, would not hurt the career of Dolf Lundgren like this movie does.
