First, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you try to take this film seriously, then, I guarantee you that it will ruin it for you. If you do not take it too seriously, then it is rather fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene in which Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif declare themselves in love - between two dodges of throwing flames springing from his arm in the car. Another great camp scene was watching John Landis as a posh radio show producer, grilling and swirling around the room. In fact, I found that the last 15 minutes of the movie was an incessant laugh-riot. I'm just not sure Tobe Hooper wanted it.
