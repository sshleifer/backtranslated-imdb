This film was not so bad compared to the first two sequels of the original. It is directed by Martin Kitrosser of Friday 13th fame. The acting is very bad, but gore and special effects make it interesting. It's something I love in Screaming Mad George (makeup artist for the movie): its effects are so weird and weird that they will make you watch a bad movie just to see how crazy they are going to be. . The film is not that gory, but there is an EXTREMELY nasty scene that engulfs the eyes, in the center, where a toy fly (what!?!) Mickey Rooney makes an appearance that probably did not Enthusiastic but he needed the money at the time, possibly? If you liked the 4th part of weirdo (my favorite among the 5), you will probably like this one. I liked it better than the matrix! Enjoy.
