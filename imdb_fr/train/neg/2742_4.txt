I stumbled upon this movie channel surfing. My first reaction was: "Oh my god, not yet!" It's so hip to play late today that it has become pretentious and downright despicable. for some reason, however, I stayed and watched it until the end. Maybe it was my trust in the actors, hoping they would give me something to cheer for. <br /> <br /> and certainly, ken and helena can act. also, the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually makes a point. <br /> <br /> helena bonham carter also surprised me with his character. Jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity. Again, she has a sweet side that just seeks love. the only thing that surprised me even more is the character of branagh ... it was a triumph of the actor, the film itself is nothing exceptional. <br /> <br /> see if you are a student theater Looking for pure entertainment, you can pass this one. it's sean penn serious! oh my god, it was a bit hard, it has some jokes ... not for the escapees though.
