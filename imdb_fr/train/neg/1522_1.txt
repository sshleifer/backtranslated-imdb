You must know that I am the kind of person who looks up to the worst movies, often out of pure morbid curiosity. I even watched Leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation to tear my eyes and trample on them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I made a frantic jump for the stop button and that I go back into the rental shop just to put the most distance possible between me and him.
