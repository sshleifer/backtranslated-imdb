The main aspect of the superstar movies at its later stages was the frequency, the gap between the films. Being a well-established star of South Indian cinema, his returns before Baba were excellent. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he has interpreted in Tamil as a mass hero in 11 years was only 11, exactly at the rate of 1 per year. All this has been a great success. He had an image that many thought could not be easily destroyed. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999), he went into hibernation. His fans around the world, especially from southern India, were ready to see movies of all kinds with their superstar in action. So, the Tamil film industry has decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought the fans would take away everything they showed with Superstar. But that clearly did not work in this movie. As usual, the hype and the fans' expectations were well beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> The image of Rajinikanth is totally damaged. The fans have gone crazy. The film collection has not reached the expected level. The reputation of great people has decreased. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film was the songs of A.R.Rehman. Rehman is known to have composed good music for some of the worst films such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. > <br /> You will feel very depressed not because the film was bad, but because of the superstar image that is crumbling. It took him five full years to fully recover him with two films, Chandramukhi and Sivaji, and give fans what they really want in a superstar movie.
