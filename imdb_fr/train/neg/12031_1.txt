First of all, this movie is not a comedy. unless you really force yourself, you can barely laugh. Second, the movie is slow and boring. The acting is not bad but not special. There's a Lucky Luke cartoon about two families (one with a big nose and one with big ears) fighting in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source for good comedy and this film only confirms this rule. There is a similar comedy on the subject "Home Instructors"; it had good times. My last comment is this: do not waste your time and money watching this uninspired and boring movie.
