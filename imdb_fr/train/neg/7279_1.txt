I just saw this movie on a local TV channel (TV8's "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio). I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I do not know any thesaurus. it can even help me describe how bad this movie really is. The script is awful. Playing a role, although this is only one of the two exceptions, makes no sense because there is nothing in this material that deserves any real effort. <br /> <br /> This sounds like a bunch of small ideas, left by various writing sessions, which where thrown into a blender. It's not just funny. The "parodic" aspect is at best tense. Some references were almost out of date (even for the moment of its release). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even In Living Color are coming out in their worst days. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, it's a great example of how not to make a movie. Whatever you do, do not waste a center. <br /> <br /> Adam
