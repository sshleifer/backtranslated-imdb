The only link this film has to horror is that it is horribly unenthusiastic. I'd rather prick my finger with a rusty fingernail than sitting there. Even for a TV movie, it's flat. The casting is boring. The scenario is as exciting as a bowl of sand. The way two directors conspired to create such a film "nothing" will remain one of the great mysteries of the twentieth century. There is only one scene, even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise, which is set in slow motion and is shortened to the expected gain. If you are tempted to see it, make it appear, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfortable. With a little luck, you will sleep quickly and the alarm will wake you up once the worst past. Namely, this movie.
