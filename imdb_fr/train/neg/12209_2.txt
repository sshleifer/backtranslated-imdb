Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, both my best friend and my brother had the policy that the person who chooses the film pays. And, while I would never pay to see some of the shit in which they took me, I could not resist a free trip to the cinema! That's how I saw bullshit like Conan's second movie and never say anything again! Now, despite the fact that it's a miserable movie, it's in fun places to watch - in a very deadly way. And, technically, the stunts and the work with the camera are good, which allows me to raise my mark up to 2! So, why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, Rambo himself only says 3 words (other than grunts and screams), there is a useless "romantic novel" and completely out of place and undeveloped and the movie is a stupid) special effect. And what special effects STUPIFYING AWFUL. Although 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are fired on Rambo, none has any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow shot by Rambo strikes his target! And, while the villains use AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes, all that Rambo had was a bow and arrow with what appears to be nuclear-powered spikes! The scene where one of the villains shoots at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these explosive arrows is particularly intended for stupid viewers! It was marvelously parodied in UHF with Weird Al. Also, HOT SHOTS, PART TWO also makes a funny parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> In short, a film so stupid and useless is almost like a parody!
