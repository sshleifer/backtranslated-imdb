The full title of this movie is "Waqt: Race Against Time". It's a race that no one can ever win, but you can certainly reduce your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious "waqt" on this bakvaa. This film was clumsy and manipulative, which made K3G look honest. This has overly solicited my credulity. He was ridiculously stupid in his story and deserves to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend. Stupid, useless, with a ridiculously OTT performance of Amitji. The central "plot" is another nasty example of the grossly manipulative propaganda that infests so many "family" BW movies. If my father, who raised me and I like a lot, treated me like Big B, Akshay, I shot him. Not to mention the trivialization of the terminal illness.
