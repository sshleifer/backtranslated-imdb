The volleyball genre is strangely neglected by most writers. Fortunately, the highly acclaimed director, Nelson McCormick, brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (ranked lower than Side Out and higher than, um, uh). However, do not let the cover of this movie seduce you. Kill Shot embodies rising star Koji as Sherlock Holmes of modern times. Using high-tech gadgets as a less powerful computer than my Gameboy, Koji is able to help FBI agents trace a man who has not committed any obvious crime. Although there are other actors in the film, including short cameos of Denise Richards, a gay negro, and a ridiculously ugly and annoying girl, Koji himself wears this film. All movie fans like The Matrix or Hackers will love Kill Shot.
