I really do not know how to comment on this movie. The special effects were dull, the acting was awful and if there was a plot, it was at the back of the box. I do not think I remember a movie as bad for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and crazy! ;) Even that could not prevent this film from being a terrible excuse to pay someone who stands in front of a camera (or remains lying in this case). <br /> <br /> global effect "zombie". Since apparently in this film, the zombies are so commonplace that to come across a couple here and there and unknowingly talk about it at a gas station (one with a windshield repair on site but no room Inner bath), the kind of zombie movie is not even a factor until the end. Even then, a cameo of a dozen zombies tearing a girl's clothes is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> On vampires: Apparently, all zombies are men and all vampires are women, which is OK by me. I do not know how the vampires are in the light of day, or why / how a vampire soldier found himself in the middle of the road, still holding his rifle with a stake in his heart, waiting only for the queen of the vampires flip through it completely. The last segment of the old convent made no sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks the other lesbian vampire, "Do you think we did the right thing? "By killing the two apparent heroes in the film, you have to put it on top. <br /> <br /> The special effects and the special effects were also at the lowest, you could almost see the pipes whose fake blood had been pumped from the close-up of the zombie that had been crushed by the general, speaking of the general, where did they find that Kenny Rogers look-alike, no idea of ​​what he was the general, except that it is usually confusing and misplaced. <br /> <br /> Overall, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the urge to waste $ 3. Just my 0.02 $.
