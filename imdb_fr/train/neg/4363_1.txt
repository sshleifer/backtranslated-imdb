It is difficult to find positive points in this film. It looks like the producer needs to make money without too much effort and so we are treated to a full projection of Galaxy, which is the most lamentable excuse for a movie in history. The policewomen looked extremely sexy in their little uniform. More action shots of the two cops and much less of Galaxy would have been the solution. Of course, this would increase the budget and so they decided to fill the void with this new execution. Ms. Albright is very sexy and her acting is first rate. Ms. Stabs, whom I had heard about but had not seen on the screen before, also seemed very desirable, but seems to lack basic acting talent. Apart from Mrs. Albright, it's a real trash.
