I can not say that I really liked this movie. It has funny moments, but it does not seem to be able to decide, be it a comedy or a drama. It does not really work like one or the other. The tone is light, it's a drama, and the fun times are rare. It does not make much sense either. What seems to happen happens for no reason. And it's also extremely complicated. I feel they just do things if they just took a little time to explain things, it could have been a better movie. I would say the end was anti-climate, but that would mean that the rest of the film was actually built I did not find it boring, really, but as I said, there's no reason. I'm going to give Winter Kills a little reluctance. and weak 3/10
