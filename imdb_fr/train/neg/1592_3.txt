To accentuate the drama of this delightful maternity story, it takes place in a special room reserved for "difficult cases". The main story is that of Loretta Young; she is on leave from a long prison for murder. Will doctors save their babies at the cost of their lives, or will they consider her husband's request for the opposite? Melodrama and sentiment dominate, and they are not honest, to say the least. For example, to keep things moving, this hospital has a psychotherapy room next to the maternity ward and allows a hysterical pregnant woman to steal babies. <br /> <br /> There's just enough laughter and sarcasm to make this film recognizable as a Warners movie, mostly from Glenda Farrell, who's taking her gin out of her hot water bottle while waiting for twins who, much to his chagrin, realize that there is now a law prohibiting the sale. An example of his repartee: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon of course has wonderful authority as a head nurse, but do not expect a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby incites anyone. Even with the obvious limitations, this film should have been better than it is.
