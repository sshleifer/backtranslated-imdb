Many people here say that this show is for children only. Hm, when I was a kid (about 7 to 9 years old), I first watched this show. It was disgusting for me. I talked to other kids about it and, of course, other shows and I know what? It was the measure of disguise, every time we wanted to emphasize the stupidity of something (whether on television or something else), we said "Uh, like Power Rangers" and we laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site, I could not imagine that there were indeed fans of MMPR. It was so strange to me that I decided to look again and try to understand why people like it. I did not appreciate this viewing. But I realized: maybe I do not have enough imagination? It's possible. However, this argument is not enough for me to evaluate more than one star.
