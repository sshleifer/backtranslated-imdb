..IT'S THIS ONE! Very cool place, from the start. <br /> <br /> At an excellent first scene, you have to give credit when the merit comes back to you. <br /> <br /> Has solid characters and a pretty decent scenario for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me: Whenever ghosts appeared, what I really liked; how was it done, how did it look ... the only thing was the ghost's relationship. Because of the way things went in the first scene, you would think that their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed down a bit too much in the middle, I felt, and the crab / spider scene was just not good. BUT then the end is actually very good! Of course, 'The Grudge' basically told the same story with a polite lens but no samurai and that's what I liked in this movie compared. <br /> <br /> Please, someone of temperate style redone this movie. <Br /> <br /> Fans of 'Silent Rage' would love this movie.
