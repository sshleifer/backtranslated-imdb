Mixed hybrid and unenthusiastic of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it is not as good as any of these classics. Artie (Taye Diggs) has been called in to investigate an almost fatal drug overdose in a posh upper class university, but to stay at the lowest. As he digs deeper, he thinks it's a lot more than it seems at first glance. We follow Alicia, the girl who also overdosed in flashbacks. After about 90 minutes, if this film had been received at the beginning, he would have used it. This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But this is the only movie to date where Miss Swain is topless, so the rating is better than that. <br /> <br /> My note: D fix an error of "Happy Campers"); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Sweets anti-eyes: more ass men than girl
