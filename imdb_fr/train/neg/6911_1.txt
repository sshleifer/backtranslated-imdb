What a huge pile of dung. Shot-on-video (REALLY DIFFICULT, NOT digital camcorder) pile of garbage. This is without a doubt the most stupid thing ever made. The fact that this shit has actually been released is completely asanine. Everyone who sees it will become stupid to have looked at it. Seriously. I felt as if he had killed several brain cells after looking at this garbage can. The positive reviews of this crap were obviously made by the "filmmaker" (and I use the term VERY vaguely) himself and / or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life. Believe me, stay away from this video. You'll thank me for that. Avoid him as herpes.
