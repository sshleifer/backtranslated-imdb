I was anxious to see this movie when it came out, because I was a big fan of SNL. When my boyfriend and I went to see him, people coming out of the first show were shouting, "Do not waste your money!" But of course, we had to discover it ourselves. <br /> <br /> Even though there were some fun elements (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of them gave the impression that it could have been modified an hour's fun show. It was very bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer made his entrance, many people got up and went out. That made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was just pressing the buttons of people on purpose with this movie. Or he was just crazy. Anyway, you do not need to waste your time looking at it, it's so serious.
