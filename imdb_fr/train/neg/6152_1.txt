When many people say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen," they tend to say that about virtually every movie they did not like. However, out of nearly 700 films I remember, this one is one of two films I did not feel insulted and angry about. By the way, this is my first movie review and I signed up for IMDb to marvel at the nastiness of this movie. I went to see him when he was in the theaters (my friends and I were 3 out of 5 people), and after 15 years, I do not remember many details, but my attitude at the exit of the theater is still clear . <br /> <br /> --- spoiler alert --- <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where to start. Big loser left at the altar, leaves the ski weekend, meets a blonde bombshell who is interested in him, takes him home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and he is the main course, pathetic attempt from a dramatic escape, knocks butte and runs away with the brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. Puke. First, the gags are so serious that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be funny and that it was a comedy. The special effects, which are rare, seem to have been made 15 years earlier. The dramatic end was so hokey and so badly behaved that it was almost unbearable to watch (he stuns the whole cannibal family with rakes lying in the lawn, standing in the manner of Tom and Jerry). I'm sure there are many, many more, but I have no intention of seeing him again for a retraining.
