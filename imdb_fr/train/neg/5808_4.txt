At a time when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a powerful, angry and powerful Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) scene-by-stage remake of Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw's 1972 action thriller about a fugitive couple. It almost worked the first time because McQueen was a vital presence on the screen - even a silent and tired stone, you could feel his clock spinning, his quiet magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor. If this is the case, it is not a showcase for its attributes. Basinger does well and looks good, but James Woods plays artificially in a silly role of magnetism. A secondary plot involving another couple hijacked by Baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in the 1972 film and played even worse here. As for the action scenes, they are rather old, which leads us to ask ourselves: why even redo the original? ** from ****
