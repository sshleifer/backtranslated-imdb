This has the worst performance of Robert Duval who sounds like William Buckley throughout the film. His melodramatic hammy play removes any dramatic interest. I do not know if it was deliberately stolen or inadvertently stolen, but it's the only thing I can remember from a truly forgettable film. This image must be shown in each class of amateur actors with an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to get a cultured accent. He's a good actor but that's about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is muted and remarkable.
