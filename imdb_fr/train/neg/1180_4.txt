Notorious for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), its darkness was its main asset, it seems. It is often better to be discussed than to be seen when you can not support the "legend" substantially. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Los Angeles several times recently. is available on home video, so that the veil rises slowly. Although there is still much to do to offend the masses, it is more likely to annoy them than to generate much real passion. With the exception of a sex scene XXX free and extended between a pair of horses ("Documentary Nature", it tempts you?), It follows almost an hour of an arranged and dull marriage melodrama. <br /> <br /> Once sex and nudity started, it's an uninterrupted sequence of masturbation, a looooooooong flashback about an alleged encounter with "beauty and the beast" and a naked woman running around the mansion ( no one, even the so-called protective aunt, even seems to think of putting clothes on her!). On video, I guess you can move quickly in the banality, but it's not really worth it. Nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantial, such as Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. <br /> <br /> Try to find "morale" or "symbolism" in carnalism, I doubt it is worthy of anybody's efforts. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can see the movie more easily, the notoriety of something formerly "forbidden" has been lifted. And this beast has been tamed.
