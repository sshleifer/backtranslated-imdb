Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered light compared to drama movies (just watch the Oscar nominations every year). But still, the good ones are really an art form. Watch "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless In Seattle", and classics such as "Roman Holiday" and "It's been a night". I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This film tries to build something that looks like a romantic comedy. But no one believes in the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing fun to fill this major gap. Modine has passed the stage of great men - especially romantics. I'm sure that as an executive producer, he had the means - but not the sense - to launch himself. And Gershon ... I see the possibilities of a comic talent, but she did not have a script and an underdeveloped character. And whose idea was the English accent? Needless. <br /> <br /> Others have said it, but I want to repeat it: this story is badly conceived, poorly executed; the actors are terribly misunderstood; and the characters, well, we just do not make fun of it. <br /> <br /> An art form that is not. Go rent "Moonstruck" again.
