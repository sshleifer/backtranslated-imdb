The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a good red wine. This film is not Cabarnet and certainly not Casablanca. I agree with the other commentators that the children of the film are an unfortunate mutation that haunts us every night in sit-coms and that the dialogue is frozen and preaches. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the film. <br /> <br /> With the passage of over sixty years of history, wisdom is brought. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been featured as a bidenseque plagiarist with her so-called "Julia" real story from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most obnoxious among a plethora of Soviet-based apologists of the USSR, it was obvious that his theme in the play and film was to urge the United States to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and the international communism of the fascists, who had just proved it. their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one critic rightly noted, this is not a pro-American drama and film because Lillian went to her grave, a disgusting communist to the states -United. This movie tells the stupid stupidity well known to the intellectual elites that made up the American left at the time, just like the complete left of the Daily Kos and Michael Moore accepted the conspiracy theories and once again brought help and comfort to those who destroy America.
