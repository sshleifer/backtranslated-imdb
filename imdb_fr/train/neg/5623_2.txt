Trying to turn Jack London's life into a "Jack London" adventure movie is not a bad idea. he had an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, ends flat and unsatisfactory. More importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (like London) has London speeches; and, it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive "The call of nature" after having a good time alone, in the snowy mountains, with his dog "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very pretty. The film draws unfortunate parallels about the "yellow peril" between London life and the Second World War, both tense and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (24/11/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
