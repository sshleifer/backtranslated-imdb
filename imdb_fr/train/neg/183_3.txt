It's a Western action. James Steart directs a cast of stars in the picturesque north-west, filmed with great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays the role of a wealthy rancher who faces a twisted government in the old northwest. <br /> <br /> The major disadvantage is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made of the hero. Even when this film was shot, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one that Stewart describes is really unlikely to save. He is kind to both partners, which gives him an extra dimension in terms of credibility and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, he is so naughty for everyone that it is difficult to take care of him, accept him. It looks a lot like the one-dimensional western spaghetti characters (not so badly cut). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the minor characters are very nice. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others are worth watching.
