Reed Diamond plays a man with amnesia who has been in a mental asylum for over ten years after being caught wondering about country roads with blood on his hands. Doctors want to test a new experimental drug that will give him back memories if it works. But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon, he chooses to escape. While he is outside, he befriends a young boy whose step-father (Greg Grunberg) abuses his mother, will not let her get near the dark room of her basement and wary in general. <br /> <br /> While the film's general "mystery" is a bit easy to identify before its revelation, I found Mr. Diamond's acting game quite captivating to hold my attention throughout . (In the interest of full disclosure, I have been a big fan of his movie since Homicide and his brief but extremely decisive role in The Shield until Journeyman & Dollhouse) This is not a great movie or good but quite useful. Although I like it better than previous movies I saw from director / screenwriter Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a pair of fleeting tits in a hallucination <br /> <br /> My note: C-
