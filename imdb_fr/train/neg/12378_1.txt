Scary and lascivious wolf. The young "Red" wears a complete makeup and shorts and an extremely short dress. After about 20 minutes, I realized that a pedophile's dream would become reality. "Rhythmic" music is very similar to something I would hear in a strip club. In fact, I think this film is a sick joke - it's not a family film. Gross, glad I look at this with my daughter, I do not want her to think that it's normal for families to watch some kiddie porn together. Very bad, very sad, it's sold as a family film, Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed there. And what about advertising as "dramatic spectacular effect" ??? The effects seem inexpensive, horrible.
