Many themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, while other parts looked like another movie, I do not know which one, but there is a familiar feeling throughout the movie. It was nice to watch, but it would have been fantastic! if the story would have been more original. The theme of the little girl, Leon's bad assassin, has been slightly modified. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the cinema :-) My biggest problem was to remember what were the parts of Leon, Nikita and if they came of the French or American version. If you have not seen Leon, then it's a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best regards / Rick
