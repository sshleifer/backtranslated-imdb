I have never seen the 1973 version, older and very well rated. I am a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, very good as usual). This film probably took every five minutes to explain the whole plot (I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party), if you can not understand the end of this drool in the first thirty minutes, you will probably find this movie entertaining. This is, for some time, the awful rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror / mystery / thriller genre, unable to give the public enough credit and write a fresh, intelligent and tempting screenplay, they play a lugubrious music and add some elements to make you jump a little, then send the final copy to the local theater. At least she did not have the portable camera syndrome.
