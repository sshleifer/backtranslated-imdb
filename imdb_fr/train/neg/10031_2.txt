I just saw the movie at the theater. The film has very few positives to talk about. The beauty of Kareena and some songs can be. That's all. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the film will be disappointed, even the Mumbai Indians (Chennai just went to the semifinals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Nowadays, Bollywood is trying to copy Hollywood action scenes. But they forget that Hollywood directors take a lot of effect to give the real impression. Unfortunately, Bollywood administrators do not have much time. They spend their time singing and advertising the film. Now, such stupid action scenes could work well in the South, the public paying only to see his favorite actor kill a lot of people. But in Bollywood, it certainly will not work. All the action scenes that I would have liked to transmit. In the end, even Chinese people appear out of nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. It's the height of stupidity. The public does not pay to watch such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget about action movies. They can not do it. The last good thing I saw was "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for fans of action movies like me. Do these people see their film once finished? Can not they understand that idling (using ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? Better not to have action scenes if you can not handle it. I just want to go back to the time of Amitabh where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar had thrilling action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective at that time, but visually, it is much better than the scenes of the time. <br /> <br /> This film should now open the eyes of Bollywood filmmakers. Please do not do any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic.
