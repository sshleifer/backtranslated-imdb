Where do you start with a movie as bad as this one? <br /> <br /> Are you talking about the distribution of unimaginable heroes? The acting game over? The terrible script? <br /> <br /> No You just said that anyone who pays money to watch a film as poor as it deserves to watch. I know what I do. I respect these poor guys who have seen it with little or no advance from magazines like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview is not available for quality magazines). However, cinemas should really start thinking about giving refunds if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went there three days after opening with two other friends. The only other person in the cinema was a guy all by himself. <br /> <br /> And it was a cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the advertising campaign failed miserably, or the word spread through most of the world <br /> <br /> It's since the time of The Avengers (1998) that I I have felt so little changed since watching a movie. If a friend arrives with the video in a few months, make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for her absence. Keith Allen retains some dignity in the midst of carnage; Barry Foster should have been stopped on the board for his performance, Rhys Ifans does not make his career a success after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is half-friendly as a busty secretary. <br /> Notice, if you're considering she used to be in The Word, viewers' expectations of her acting ability needed to be low enough to start. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not bad considering the obviously limited budget but this scenario is excruciating. If you want to hear a group of unimaginable characters say "Fak!" for a few hours, this should fit your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, barges are necessary. <br /> <br />
