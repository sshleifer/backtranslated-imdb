Listen, I read and read these comments and there are many that I want to say but I will try to make it short but clean ... <br /> <br /> First, let's forget all the how this film was done ... How did it show anything of Notorious and I agree with most of the people here who say it's "Hollywood", I mean, what did you expect from a true story? When will people wake up and see that you will never find the truth about 2pac and Biggie ... Everything is covered and buried deep down. <br /> <br /> Second, I'm not against 2pac nor Biggie I love them both but 2Pac and Lil Kim are NOT embarrassed in this movie, that's for sure ... <br /> <br /> Then, for all those who say that the film is great and can not see the truth, either you are too blind to see it because you think you know something about BIG or you do not know anything of him at all and that you love this teen movie in Hollywood. Use your mind and see if the clouds ... You can say a lot when it comes to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say because it's a very big subject but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a little, I mean a job much better done. But finally, I am only one who gives his opinion .... No grudge ... <br /> <br /> Listen, I love hip-hop and I live for it, but after having Having seen this movie, every person with an intelligence could see that it's not how someone is supposed to live. With all the respect you have for 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who make a good living, you should turn the other page because you're ruining the youth ... passing the wrong message to the kids and that's : do not go to school, but live in the street, jostling and grab the paper .... <br /> <br /> True hip-hop means talking about love and 'intelligence. OK, I know that many of you will think I'm crazy, but that's just my point of view. Look, maybe I'm wrong about something and I'm not saying it's a totally bad movie because even though I've been in hip-hop for 17 or 18 years, I still do not know anything about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music ... Like most of you. Only the people who were very close to them and the assassins know the truth behind all this. <br /> <br /> And finally, I just want to say that all Biggie and Tupac fans and their families, these two men were and They will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their life, but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE, TRY TO BE BETTER, LEARN AND LOVE YOU, THINK A GOOD ONE FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT LOVE YOU, BECAUSE IT'S END ... .This is not about how much money or glory U could gain and how fast could go up, that is to say, to accomplish one's self to the maximum and nourish one's soul, one's body and one's mind ... Because if we succeed in doing so, YOU WANT TO LIVE A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH !!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT EYE, JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHERS THAT HAVE MADE A CHANGE IN THIS WORLD !!!!
