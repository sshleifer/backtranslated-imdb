I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or since. Debralee Scott appears on the cover boxes, but does not appear at all in the film. The writing is bad enough, even for college movies. This is obviously a very small budget, with a sorority house scene having an extremely hectic editing. <br /> <br /> The characters are pretty typical for college movies - shy guy, nerd, suave black guy, hard guy, guy with mustache, alluring girl, little town girl, etc. The featured teacher is talking about what you would expect ... a beefy older guy, who is easily distracted. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to go to Flick College, stay away from it. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
