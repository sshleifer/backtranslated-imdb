A remake of Abre los Ojos by Alejandro Amenabar, but this time with a breathing mask alive. For the dubious benefit of an English soundtrack, we support Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his personality, but we usually have a character below it to hold our interest. His empty posture denies any erotic energy that might have existed between his character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor and enrich his presentation of the character verbally and corporally the language means. The masking of Cruise only painfully highlights his lack of acting. See the original 1997 Amenabar, open your eyes!
