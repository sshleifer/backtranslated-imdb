I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a movie. I was not trained even for a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw out all the topics they could think of hoping that something would stay. I would bet (and hope) that all the people involved in the Teachers look back with embarrassment. There are big players here but you would never know it. Thank goodness it did not destroy the careers of Morgan Freeman, Judd Hirsh, Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no love work here, only a horrible effort that went wrong. BTW I do not think the writer ever set foot in a real school.
