I grew up with Scooby doo all my life, my father grew up with Scooby doo. We just watched the first episode of the tragedy called Shaggy and Scooby get a clue. On which planet does Warner Bros. allow this chaos to dull? The characters could have been better drawn by my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my twin cousins ​​aged 3 (who are also fans of Scooby Doo). Scooby and Shaggy are just not !!!!! if someone other than Casey Kasem is Shaggy's voice, it's just not going to work guys !!!! believe me. <br /> <br /> This program was shameful. What's up Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format? Trash this trash and go back to the real Scooby
