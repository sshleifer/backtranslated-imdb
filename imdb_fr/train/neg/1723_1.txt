Dude, what a scam that turned out! Not because it was not good (because I did not really expect that) but because I was misled by the DVD cover that, ignorant, scrolled his "stars" like Stuart Whitman , Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Indeed, their names do not appear in the opening credits of the film, let alone in the rest! In reality, the only film that connects these three actors is LAS VEGAS LADY (1975), just as obscure. ?? but what does this have to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, since I paid $ 1.50 for her rental and that I was in a monster film atmosphere anyway, I chose to watch the film anyway and, yes , it smelled bad! Apart from the fact that there was an unnamed cast and an anonymous crew, an undeniably amateurish air was visible from afar and all I could do with it was laughing at the pretensions of the JAWS and intentionally resistant. antics of two feeble laymen-boat owners who often quarrel with each other under the perplexed local sheriff. The creature itself ?? a plesiosaur, that is, half-dinosaur / half-fish? is imperfectly realized (naturally) but, as was the case for THE GIANT CLAW (1957), which I have just seen too, this does not seem to bother filmmakers, as they display them as much as they can, especially during the second half of the film!
