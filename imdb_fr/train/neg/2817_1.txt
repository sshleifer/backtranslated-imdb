Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest problem that the kind of horror has to offer. Like any other horror fan, I loved the chainsaw in Texas, but I think to put your name in front of a movie title, you must have at least more than one hit movie. I can not really think of another film that Hooper did (alone, do not count Poltergeist) and that really had an impact on the kind of horror or the movie world. And this movie, Night Terrors, just confirms my point of view. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I credit him with having done at least a good job with the horrible material he has received. He did what he could. As for the film itself? Pure drudge. Useless nude scenes every five minutes, a story that had to be written in a truly horrible landscape, music and cinematography. Nothing in this movie is refundable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 in 10. I'm sorry for Hooper, his career seems to be over before I even start. I hope he will be able to produce at least one other good movie, so he can do justice to his cult status. <br /> <br />
