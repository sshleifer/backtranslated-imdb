This film is nothing more than a religious leaflet promoting classical Hinduism and New Age occultism, dressed with Western images and intended to be swallowed by those who ignore fundamental religious comparisons. The basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600s) obviously reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. Animal life and plant life are all the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield tried to mix Eastern mysticism and Western christianty. His attempt at syncretism may deceive or confuse those who are not in search of the truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any ultimate reality. As the announcement in Old Berkeley said, Barb said, for $ 10.00, how to start one's own religion. As one famous prophet said, "Use the Luke Force".
