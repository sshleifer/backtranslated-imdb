This movie was certainly not one of the best movies of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it and I was a little disappointed by this movie. For some reason, it seemed like a movie they put together very quickly. In some areas it became so boring that I had to move it forward quickly. He did not have bloopers or exciting parties like their other movies.
