I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the movie were up since I heard it was being done. Some days I saw something spectacular and some days I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> However, being the kind of fan that I am, I had great hopes for this film but in the end I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I like Richard Donner's films, I did not like their sometimes overly campy nature or the changes to the Superman character and his powers. <br /> <br /> Singer however chose to take the worst elements of the Donner movies and put them in its version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is slightly darker, he's still nothing more than a fool, a crook and an ordinary criminal. He is not smarter than when Gene Hackman played it. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but he ends up being the victim of poor quality writing and harmless dialogue. <br /> <br /> His henchmen are more two-dimensional than the cartoon men. Most of them literally have no dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Mrs. Tesmacher. She seems to be as cold and perverse as Lex Luthor, but she turns out to be just an underlying that melts after seeing Superman in trouble and who, predictably enough, betrays Luthor. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the film was Frank Langella Perry White. I was not a big fan of Perry White in the Donner movies, but at least he had a soul. After all, he was a veteran journalist who cared about the truth and a good story. Perry White, of Langella, is nothing but a stooge. He wants everyone to focus on stories related to Superman, because they sell newspapers even though all the other newspapers do the same thing. He does not care about real stories, real mysteries like the blackout and Lex Luthor is out of jail. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that he's DULL! Some actors can be quiet and sober while having an undercurrent that lets you know that the waters are always deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. It's fine, but again, there is not one memorable line in the entire movie. Not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly meant to look gracious, even the slightest movement of his fingers affects how he flies. But it always looks choreographed and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, though poorly written, was surprisingly well performed by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, for a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is about as eloquent as any teenager in Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden has been my favorite actor in the entire movie, mainly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without any super power, he manages to understand Lois Lane's message, board the plane, board Luthor's yacht, and save Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the film is when they are all the pantry trapped while it is flooded with water and the ship is sinking. You see them slowly plunge into the water. You know that Superman will come at the last moment to save them, but you can not help but complain. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plot is very random. Contrary to what Singer says, it's not a movie about a superhero coming back and trying to find his place in the world. Upon his return, the world welcomes him with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him again. Even Luthor is happy to find Superman because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel. <br /> <br /> It is shown that Superman is probably one of the stupidest heroes in the universe. A large piece of green meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of jail, he now knows the powers and weaknesses of Superman and yet he is still not able to connect enough points to know that Luthor would use kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the movie, the only thing Superman is good at is raising really heavy things. The action sequences are all incredibly predictable.
