I thought it was a really awful movie - I found myself screaming on TV a few times. One or both homosexual male sons were a broadcast error; There was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo seemed to prefer kissing a dog. The film covers their long and tortured court, highlighting each breakup and each make-up, without elaborating in detail the reasons between the two. These reasons would make interesting characters, not the fight or the makeup scene in bed (lame even if you liked the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters do not bother to rent the movie. Save your money.
