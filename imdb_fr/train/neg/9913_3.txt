This is one of those TV movies made cheaply and whose characters seem to lose all meaning. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father, is very good. But the story just seems to beg the belief. Whenever you advise the mother to do nothing, you know she will do it. It's a little exaggerated and not worthy of a viewing.
