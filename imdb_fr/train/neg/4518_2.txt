Few films have exceeded expectations and upset me as much as Fire. The film is a pretentious bin. This does not end in anything at the artistic level. The only thing he has managed to receive is a ban in India. If only because of the poor quality of film making rather than the current controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable. <br /> <br /> Now that my distress has come out of my system, I am no longer able to analyze the film: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning, the film seems unreal, especially when the protagonists begin to speak in English. Of course, the director did not make the film for an Indian audience; However, he underestimated his international audience by oversimplifying it. Watching the domestic help character conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> * Then we regularly glimpse Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They arrive as a starter and obstruct the flow of the film. I still wonder how this philosophical dialogue is related to history. I felt that surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * The scenes of love seemed to be voyeuristic and are probably intended to titillate the audience instead of being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not realize either of them. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and were therefore chosen to shock audiences. However, as the film was not intended for the Indian public, the selection of names by shock is not intended to achieve its objective, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the staging is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been badly treated. A better director could have created a powerful emotional drama from the subject. <br /> <br /> * The acting game seemed wooden, although Nandita Das revived the role, the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not obvious in this film. The male lead roles were downright nil. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Earth and want to see more directors, stay away from it. Please.
