This is the kind of movie that we look at in a horrified and horrified silence, but who continues to watch, hypnotized, as if watching a wreck of a train in slow motion. And yet, in the back of your mind, thoughts are jostling: "Who of the Earth has cleared this junk?" to Laurel and Hardy "- an insult to children around the world The fact that children need a training plan to learn to love blinding comedy is a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others commented on the fidelity of Laurel and Hardy's characterizations by the two stars, which I would say: so WHAT? One might think that BOMBS movies based on beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) have shown Hollywood that there are things that can not be recreated Laurel and Hardy's films are available on video: why bother with that? <br /> < br /> As for F. Murray Abraham, a good actor of theater and stage ... well, all I can say is, he must have trouble with the IRS. <br /> < Run, do not walk, stay away from the TV if this trash lights up!
