Yes .. it's certainly up there with some of the worst movies in MSTifyed, but I certainly have seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at a sci-fi convention, he was amazingly a speaker! It was one of those low-budget conventions, where everything was happening, where everyone was bringing something (if you want to see shit, you should have seen what friends and I brought). <br /> <br /> He seemed to be a very nice guy, he was very nice about my questions and comments about Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take him seriously, and said he loved the MST3K version! Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think was destined to hurt like Mars Attacks. So I guess I get up for this movie and give it a 5, and betray all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.
