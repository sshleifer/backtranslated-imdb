The truth is that a film based on a novel by Harold Robbins will not win any prize. This is not an exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B picture in her budget, casting and execution. Technically, it looks like a movie made for television. The acting is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As a review of a certain performance by Katherine Hepburn said, its range is from A to B. Ms. Zedora manages to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and lost in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. That said, everything can be very fun, trashy. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for fun ... and you are not too sober ... it could be for you.
