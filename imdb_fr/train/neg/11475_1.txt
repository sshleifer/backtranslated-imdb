A film that makes you want to jump on a sword. I already saw schlock in my time, but after watching the miserable disaster, I never think I can watch another movie again. May God have mercy on the souls who made it. <br /> <br /> Premiss- Ex-Army Stud calm, underwear type character (well played) looking for the girl who sent him a Christmas card while he was a soldier. . She lands with her granola family living in a cabin and right-hand loggers. His family takes it and it takes 2 hours of our time for the girl to realize better than her liberal appearance, his French drinking wine, driving porsche, talking loudly with his mobile phone, lazy, quoting a fianc√©e with a Jewish look. <Br /> <br /> Bad 1d characters, 1d themes. To be beaten on the head with the pro-military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> The good advertising breaks were long. Peter Jason. It ended.
