Oh my God. It was a real mess that just could not help it. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29 year old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not intend to leave. Until his mother meets a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels), with whom she may marry. <br /> <br /> It would have been an OK movie if Heder had not played his so-annoying Jeffrey from the start. start, there is no chance to love him and this only gets worse. In the end, we are supposed to like it, but there was no reason to do it, because it had not changed since the selfish brute that it was at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not seem to be even trying and is in a horrible form after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where are they supposed to believe that their mother and their son? Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris are the only people who can save us, even if they do not seem very interested either. Apart from a few smiles, this movie does not really deserve to be called comedy, simply because there is almost no reason to laugh! If you're craving a recent Diane Keaton movie, look at Mad Money or Smother, which are far better than this appalling effort.
