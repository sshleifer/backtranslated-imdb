It's probably the worst Christmas film of all time. The plot is virtually non-existent, the actor (Affleck in particular) is poor at best. The fans of Ben Affleck will probably defend this film but, basically, they must agree. As far as I know, the plot is composed of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, who is asked by a psychiatrist to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burns a list of things he wanted to forget about his childhood. In doing so, he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film continues and it ends up being with the daughter of the family ... blah blah blah.
