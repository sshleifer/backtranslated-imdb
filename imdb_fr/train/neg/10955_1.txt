This is the story of two guys who found a copy of "Funky Monkey". It seemed strange at the time to think that there were still posters for the movie at the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing classics such as "Everyone except Loose" and "Project X", these two guys thought movies with monkeys were awesome. <br /> <br /> These guys were going for a long ride watching this movie. A monkey has been replaced by a Stunt MAN when action sequences are needed. It was obvious that the monkey had not been trained at the school of Shakespearian acting. Maybe replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might have helped the guys. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong sidekick would help like a Jackie Chan or maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this film had an amazing martial artist and a similar to Matthew Li Modine. While some claim that Matthew Modine is not close to Jet Li, the camera's tricks prove he's just as good. When it becomes clear that an untrained chimpanzee can not handle the film, the film relies on Matthew Modine to become the real star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that a weak young boy who develops a bond with Modine and the monkey? Is there a possibility that the kid will learn to feel confident and even take a girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous with this one (because the use of the "I am the second fiddle of a monkey" line of support does not seem to work with the ladies.) <br /> </ br> > Shortly after watching this movie video, the two guys received a phone call from Matthew Modine telling them "Seven Days".
