I just watched the convent for the second time. I had already enjoyed it before and thought it would make a good drunken drunken drunk movie, some gore, a little bit of style, a little humor and the like. I was saddened to find that I could not appreciate it much anymore. It seemed like someone had decided to revisit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience, but had lost what made the original worthwhile. For the record, I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons, but there are things I've really dug up about it. The convent makes cheese but not so much goodness. Apart from the main daughter (Joanna Canton's friendly performance), Adrienne Barbeau's Gothic girl and sweet cameo, all the characters were incredibly incredible, feeding at the absolute lowest level of insane and stupid jockhood. The film is then severely hampered by the complete lack of free nudity, which means that, given the awful dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and appreciate the highlights of the film. The devilish nuns are original in their design and have a lot of good scenes, although they are not scary, they are certainly pretty cool, and the movie also offers a good amount of gore. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau will be on the scene, the film will become quite entertaining, as all the unpleasant people are dead and it is a diabolical frenzy for the nuns. The stylized direction also sometimes gives good results, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. Overall, it was a film where, for me, the positives can not compensate for what I hated. Those who are more fond of this type of film may well enjoy more, but for me, it was not a good time.
