Absence of GOOD GROUNDS, lack of good action, lack of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, lack of good appearance SPECIAL EFFECTS ... should I continue? Review MAY contain spoiler. The actors seem to read their lines, and not very good at that. Most "actors" acted as if they were in a second-grade room. The story seems to have been written by one of the aforementioned sophomore students ... it's not really complicated ... it's so SIMPLE and DUMB, that a person thinks he's missing something to believe it. No it is not, it's just as simple as you think. I understand the "film", that's how I know it's amazing! Most of the movie was just talking to people sitting (reading their lines), trying to sound sinister. The narrator was angry. The "special effects" were RIRE. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... but not in THIS film ... you can say that they are not paid, or not a lot, because neither their heart nor their heart talents were in it. I LOVE Tony Todd ... However, it was only enough in this movie. In fact, the performance of Tony Todd is the ONLY reason why I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony only stayed for TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I suggest moving the DVD quickly into Tony Todd's two-minute segment. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than a dollar to see this "movie", I would have been P.O.'D and asked to be reimbursed. Let's hope the people who did this will do better next time.
