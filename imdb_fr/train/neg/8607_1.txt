<br /> <br /> The movie "Slugs" is one of a kind, because the vermin holder is actually the good guy of this horrible nature story that went wrong. You see, these poor slugs have been mutated by the pollution of evil humans and do not want to do anything clever, they are just slugs - sharp-toothed slugs that eat flesh and excrete poison, but slugs do not are none the less so. The real bad guys are humans, who are actively trying to destroy our beloved slugs or react excessively when they meet them. <br /> <br /> For example, let's take the stage where the guy puts his glove full of slugs. They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when, emerging from nowhere, this giant hand attacked them and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this guy runs into his greenhouse shouting like an idiot, spreading extremely volatile chemicals, lighting a fire, knocking over a bookshelf, and cutting his own hand, then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes. How can you blame this for slugs? <br /> <br /> This film draws a portrait of the less favorable human being. The characters in this movie include the silly sheriff who hates everyone, the drunk hick who is mean to his dog and the lumpy companion whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There is also a series of drunken teenagers <br /> <br /> who are attacked during copulation, and we have to see the genitals of monsters with long, lean hair. Meanwhile, there's a guy who looks like a demoness Leslie Neilson who shouts "You do not have the power to declare a happy birthday!" for some reasons. Finally, this parade of disgust is completed by the guy of the classic "Pod People" MST3K whose face explodes after eating a slug salad (another easily avoided destiny and imputed to slugs helpful and safe). <br /> <br /> Humans are described as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic and, in a useless scene, as true rapists. In the culminating scene of the film, the wicked humans are trying to burn the slugs that snuggle in the sewers, Since they are idiots, humans manage to BLOW THE ENTIRE CITY. They alone do more damage than slugs! <br /> <br /> If you hate humans and I know it well, you'll appreciate slugs. If you are a fan of bad cinema, you will also enjoy this crapfest from the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There is enough bad acting, idiotic dialogues, illogical twists, lame special effects, useless scenes and mediocre dubbing to catch your attention.
