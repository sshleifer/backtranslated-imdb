This film was shot and shot from my hometown. I remember all that history and everything that worked out about the fact that Molly Ringwald was in town ... <br /> <br /> Scenario ... <br /> <br /> Essentially 20 years old after the "laying of a film" to rest "without having finished, a group of film students decided to complete it - with disastrous consequences.It seems that someone does not want the film to be finished. br /> <br /> The story is fragile, you have to remember that it's a comedy and therefore you have to take a little time, but it does not really have a punch. for the most part, and the little information you receive about them does not interest you, it seems out of place, it's weird to hear Kylie's accent again as an Australian and that's nice to see a kid with whom I went to school in a leading role, but that does not buy the movie at all. Ideurs thought they would go to Molly Ringwald. Maybe because of the nature of the film (it's sort of a tribute to 80s movies / bad horror movies) but an Australian actor would have done very well. <br /> <br /> Regarding casting, a lot of the acting game seemed constipated. Some of these children (especially the two main children - they were playing "director" and "producer") seemed to want to play. It's never a good look. In addition, the shots had a rough impression on them. On enlightened perhaps? Just not as smooth as you are used to. <br /> <br /> The killer. Lord. Could it be less scary? There are however some shock factors and some raw scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not great. It lasted 90 minutes, but could have been cheaper. Maybe if they had tightened the scenario, it would have been better. Many characters have been killed, but nothing prevents them from being killed. Maybe if they had killed fewer people and had actually focused on a scary atmosphere, it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Now, I know it's a comedy and the elements were fun. Or so amazing that they were funny. But I am not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
