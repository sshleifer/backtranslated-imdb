Looking at "Kroko", I would have liked to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: main characters dishes - absolutely no development, for example. Kroko, the German metaphorical child, remains a pure metaphor without any possibility of positive implication, despite several chances of conspiracy. Actors without inspiration, non evolutionary plot. I imagine that the film tried an environmental study but did not succeed: the camera appeared fragile rather than motivated. The images were faintly contrasted, gray and dark - I'm sure it's deliberately, but the components are not a convincing impression of the social milieu. The story had a certain potential, it could have made a good short story.
