I love low-budget independent films and I had high hopes for this one. But this film is static. No matter the value of production, which is very noble for its budget, but the pace is deadly. True, these people achieve a lot with little, but the film fails at the most basic level. It's boring. The assembly is freezing and the stalls of stimulation. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who is not seen often enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, we must suffer from the fact that we say that Baltimorean-Brits stammers by an endless and tedious exhibition. It's like an endearing play dedicated to video. <br /> <br /> Everyone's efforts for production are noble, but such a tiresome story needed a kick, and the new, budget-friendly technology should have given it a new voice. Instead, it's just a lame retread.
