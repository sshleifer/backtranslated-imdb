Ok, so I understand. We are supposed to be horrified. The idea was planted. A girl makes her father and takes pictures. Call me for the shock-rock genre but I'm asking for the explicit details of an act before I can fall in love with it. But do not expect me to watch a soft-porn and be horrified at what she's "doing her father" ... I mean, has not this convention become a little abused by adult film industry already infiltrated by "rape" porn ... The horror is not what your mind can lead you to believe in. That's what really exists in the movie. Fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes sweet when it becomes a choice of your own adventure.
