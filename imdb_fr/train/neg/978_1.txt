I recently watched this movie with my sister who loves Sophia Loren's performances. I am a person they call a cultural barbarian. I hate art in all its forms. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kill, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this situation, avoid this film like the plague. Nobody dies, no action, no nudity, nothing of the sort. Let me give you a summary in a few sentences. It starts with 5 minutes of Nazi propaganda in black and white. Every Italian in a real estate block attends a parade in honor of Hitler, with the exception of a housewife, an anti-fascist and a guardian. The housewife deceived by her husband meets the antifascist. She falls in love with him, wants to make love to her, but the antifascist is gay. Despite this, they make love to each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover and the guy is expelled by agents. The end. Want an even shorter resume? BORING ... It's pretty short? The guy should have used his weapon at the beginning of the film and shoot himself to save the public from this atrocity. On a side note my sister liked this movie. As I said, I am a cultural barbarian ...
