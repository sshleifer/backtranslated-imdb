{rant start} I did not want to believe them at first, but I guess that's what people are talking about when they say that South Korean cinema has reached its peak and perhaps even deteriorating. After the surprisingly entertaining and moving monster film "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host") of 2006 - which actually managed to create a sharp satire of the genre of B-movie - successive Korean blockbusters became more and more generic even though their budgets (mainly devoted to special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Do South Korean filmmakers really want to spoil all the goodwill of the public and investors that their sector has built up since the 1999 film, "Shiri / Swiri", by producing a series of mediocre, high-budget films such as Mainland China? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can understand to make this movie is to trick investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean / Oriental dragon Asiatic I have never seen so far, for the final scenes. Now, if they had introduced this dragon in the beginning and conferred on it more personality and utility, as in "Dragonheart" of 1996, the film might have a few more qualities that redeem than many numerically animated dragons . Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? Has not someone realized that the trick is not the amount of special effects you use, but how you use it? I hope they will be able to use more Korean legends (and of better quality) because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree. with all the negative reviews that have been heard before and I wonder what the Koreans think of seeing their folk anthem "Arirang" play at the very end. As a creature function, I would have awarded at least 5 stars out of 10 if special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripts (less dragons).
