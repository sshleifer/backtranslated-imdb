it could have been a good movie if he had explored something more interesting rather than the surface of a lesbian relationship if that was the meaning of the film ... it's quite predictable not to mention that the two girls look like the Russian group TATu. ..coincidence? I do not think so. There is nothing original in this film to support it so they had to use something that is already famous. You know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I just do not know what their role is. Most of them are well known people in Romania and I must mention that some of them are not even actors (for example, Mihaela Radulescu). To summarize: "group of girls faded" + desperate / advertising requiring "actors" + non existing plot + opportunity to use foul language to shock = love sick ... too bad ... the idea was good, however ... and I seriously refrain from commenting on the title ...
