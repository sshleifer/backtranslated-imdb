The IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. It certainly did not kill me for an hour and a half, but that did not really impress me either. A group of children are kidnapped in an alley by muscular mutants (in a scene where the sound effect is the least convincing of the cinema) and taken to a luxury house in the suburbs. Here, Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his old and wealthy patients so that they can again have a young body. Hey, this was quietly done again with a big budget a few years later in FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an elderly person's brain into a different body, his new voice sounds exactly like their old voice? With all this talk about the pineal glands and the use of a bright green serum, you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the heads of the producers. But production literally does not have the courage to get out of it. I never understood why, when you make a low-budget horror movie, you do not put it on the edge of the frame with gore. The acting game is uniformly dreadful, with only good performance by Clarke Lindsley as assistant to Dr. Price. He has a beautiful, devilish laugh. The only other thing to note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features a lot of older people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most actors take serious bumps for the elderly.
