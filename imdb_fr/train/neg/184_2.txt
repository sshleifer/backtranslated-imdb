Mann superbly photographs the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, while Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan offer enjoyable performances, as they always seem to do. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - a policeman inviting the people of Dawson City, Yukon, to be elected marshal (yes, a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then to beat on the street for control of the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing unlike what happens on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike Gold Rush. Mann and the company seem to have confused Dawson with Deadwood, Canadian North and American West. <br /> <br /> Canadian viewers should be prepared for a nice screaming kind of Reefer Madness with this ridiculous plot, or shake their heads with disgust.
