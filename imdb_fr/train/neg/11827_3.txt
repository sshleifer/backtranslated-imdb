I have just returned from a free screening and I am very happy not to have paid to see this very mediocre film. The theater was full and the crowd was made up of children and adults. It seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap-stick jokes and farting (God, they really liked hitting those poor mice at the fork!). The film is rather juvenile, unintelligent, predictable and especially boring. The characters just seemed to be gathered together to fill empty spaces and the relations between them all seemed very forced, without charm at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is about average with nothing that really stands out. They did a decent job imitating the clay look of Wallace and Gromit, but other than that, they are very forgettable pictures. <br /> <br /> Even though I was really bored during the whole movie, I laughed a few times. This is not an absolute failure, but I would not want to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and you do not want your kids to see stupid and cheap jokes), do not hesitate to take them to see this, but not everyone should waste their money.
