This unpleasant film has little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren gives a better performance than this scenario or his other action movies have allowed. And there are some fragments of dialogue that suggest that the film could have given a glimpse of this bizarre subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivations are obscure or banal. Most of the roles are below normal. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's useless fascination to focus on the gore is distracting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
