It's by far the worst thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers it to you for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you a stupider person than knowing you've watched it. The plot is not even the worst part of this movie ..... it's the actor, the camera work, the lighting and the sound there is absolutely nothing to like in this film. whoever paid for this movie is broken now. I hope the director will never get the green light for another film. In his defense, this film was made quickly to try to capitalize on the capture of the killer of BTK, but I saw a film of weeks that looked like an Oscar winner compared to this one.
