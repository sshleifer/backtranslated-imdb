What a shitty movie! The worst of the worst! This film is as much fun as a dead slug. No talented actor, stupid plot. Who wrote this script ?! Has there ever been a scenario for this wacky film or did the director simply accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decide to edit the film as he went? Is it supposed to be a children's movie or a comedy or what? The little brother of my friends is in Grade 6 and he and his classmates have just made an amateur film for their school project that surpasses this geek movie. It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! There is no excuse for this movie!
