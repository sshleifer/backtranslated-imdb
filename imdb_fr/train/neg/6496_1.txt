This film was a disappointment. I could not wait to see a good movie. I'm the kind of person who starts a movie and does not turn it off until the end, but I forced myself not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not turn it off is because I'm a big fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see him play in this movie. I was really speechless after I finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies of my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting a little humor. If you had not been in this movie, I would be bored. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins must stay true to her role. At the end of the movie, I did not even understand the plot. I was both confused and annoyed.
