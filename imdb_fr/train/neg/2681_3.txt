A very good story for a movie that, if done correctly, would be pretty interesting, but where the heck is the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is it for? <br /> The scenes scroll so quickly that you felt you were not part of the film with emotion, and the feeling of not understanding the script. <br /> <br /> The performance of the distribution is questionable, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Have I forgotten the conclusion somewhere in the film? I guess we have to wait for more. <br /> <br />
