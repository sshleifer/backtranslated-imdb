There are a few previous comments that explain the abundance of clich√©s in this movie - and I totally agree, both with regard to characters AND dialogue. <br /> <br /> I had read about the appalling Elizabeth Berkly her performance in the equally awful "Showgirls" I've never seen - and her performance here, though not horrible, is barely up to the worst price of Lifetime. His character did not have the slightest depth, but he probably should not have been. If this had been the case, the film would have been completely unbalanced because there was no trace of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any character, performer or portrait. <br /> <br /> The director's handling of the initial complaint by the headmistress after the mutineer kissed her in the hall was laughable. The initial reaction and her husband's advice were also the same (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in his car, offered a more realistic and intelligent action, and, hey, he was mentally handicapped). <br /> <br /> The creamy lawyer (excuse the dismissal) the father of the liar student actually played something worthy of praise in his interpretation: it was both laughable and completely boring, this which is not an easy task. His lawyer was rather an insensitive nerd, who was not unknown in the profession. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I liked this part), the police was such a collection of insensitive criminals that you rely instead on Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all the activities of policing and investigations in your community. I know that most real policemen fall short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters in the "Law and Order" series, etc., but the dolts of this level seems to be a staple on "Lifetime". <br /> <br /> Finally, I found a kind of story in a story, fascinated by the fact that Josh was the "victim" of his teacher. This scripted performance in the story was even worse than its overall performance in the main story. It was a feat, like going from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting. between the teacher and the school authorities, with the husband involved. But then that would have prevented the next artificial drama, and would have left a blank film of one hour in the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writer (s) here, proved that with their end, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "corrected", all that took about 45 seconds, without any indication of the measures that could have been taken in a "real" context for the author and his parents, could have found a way to redemption. <br /> <br /> It's a 2 * presentation; the second "*" because he has a slight "fascination".
