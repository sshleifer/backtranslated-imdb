The plot certainly seemed pretty interesting. How to turn a real brutal murder into a really boring movie? Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out. <br /> <br /> I had heard about the murders in Wonderland before the release of this film and I found it to be an interesting and true story of truly sadistic people. Unfortunately, the development of characters is zero, so we never have the opportunity to understand why it was done or understand the relationship between the characters. The pace of management was very tedious. All of this leads to an extremely boring movie. <br /> <br /> Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character of Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and Holmes's wife was a consultant for the film, we should have had the opportunity to get a real-world view of the characters
