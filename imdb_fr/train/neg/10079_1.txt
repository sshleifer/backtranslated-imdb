When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric and highly addictive experience. My sister and I were looking at it, rewinding it and watching it again and again until we fainted or became too confused and hostile to stand up to each other. So, if you're an 11-year-old girl and you consider this movie to be "brilliant," "fun," or "better than the original Grease," you have to blame your nascent teenage hormones and you can rest assured that this inflexible fixation with the final garbage will pass. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an absurd, naive and naive embarrassment to all who participated in its production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> For the sake of criticism, I will now make the film worthy of the name by explaining why it explodes ?? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs must advance the story or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with some dubious exceptions, music is obscurely useless. Most of the songs seem to relate exaggerated and general sex-typed allusions ("Score Tonight", "Reproduction", "Do it for our country" and "Prowlin" ") without making a concrete statement about a elements, characters or themes of the film, and all the music is incredibly stupid, and no one in the cast demonstrates the grossest semblance of singing or dancing. <br /> <br /> 2. The T birds should be tough, and if not at least a bit friendly, but each of them is an annoying loser.In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-jacket and initiates it To the gang, Michael should send him to the ground, spit on and hide himself to scrub fervently any part of his body that would have been touched ... But of course, he accepts it as if it were gold because, despite the fact that it is a band of collapsed moors, there is no more great honor to be one with the T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael is handsome, intelligent, kind, resourceful and above average in all cases (despite his musical helplessness), it's possible that Stephanie will finally kiss her when he gets reveals to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, meanwhile, is a dirty and worn sweatshirt, with wide jaw and jaw dropping, a ruthlessly coarse and trashy dingbat. So, besides being pretty (I guess), she does not have any nice features, so the public is in no way justified by the depth of Michael's appeal to her. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I did not want to talk about the blatant inferiority compared to its predecessor, because there are apparently so many cranks that seem to think that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for the good old days: Grease 2 is an experience that resembles reliving your first kiss. Only you are now 32 years old and kiss a 13-year-old with a broken nose, acne and braces. The magic is gone and you feel dirty and disturbed. Believe me.
