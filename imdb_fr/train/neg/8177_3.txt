90 minutes from Mindy ... Mindy is a tease for his boyfriend Bill ... Mindy advances to the high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur, he steals a piece of "shepherd's bread "Mindy is almost raped by a gang. Oh, the pleasures of Crown International's drive-in features. You must remember that these movies were never designed to be viewed end-to-end on DVD players. They were created for 90 minutes of ambiance so that the teenagers of the 70s have a soundtrack identical to the one they found in their Pintos and Quotes. The lack of pace and structure was of little importance to the original audience. They probably knew only when the T & A on the screen matched what they were doing in the parking lot. The film is really irritating when you look at it like a story. It's a lot more fun to talk about than to watch it. My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without luggage or change of underwear, they spend 2 nights in a motel room with the teacher, as in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and almost raped by depraved bikers, and after their innocent friend "Pan" was savagely beaten, Mindy and his girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road. Mindy immediately lights up and chirps, "I'm going to Big Sur !!" But again, it's much more fun to talk / read than to sit down.
