Really bad movie, the story is too simple, predictable and mediocre. <br /> <br /> The story of this vampire hunter is the worst I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), is traveling Mexico looking for blood suckers! he uses interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of Van Helsig's vampire hunter network, OK, but he works alone. He is assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen looking for a black crucifix to perform a ritual allowing him to be invulnerable to the sun (it's almost a sequel to Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and interpreted by James Woods), Derek begins his search for the queen with new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, very bad actor too), inexperienced teenager, father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente), Catholic priest, Zoey ( Natasha Wagner), a particular vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary), another expert vampire hunter. So, obviously, in this adventure, he is not alone. <br /> <br /> You can start to feel how good this movie would be by watching its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); There is a huge difference in the quality of the game compared to James Woods, and then, if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part), you'll be involved in one of the simplest, totally predictable stories, with terrible performances. , really bad special effects and inconsistent events !. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not to see this movie!, Rent another movie, watch another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
