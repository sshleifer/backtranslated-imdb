One of the many slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks is notable only for Daphne Zuniga's early performance (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); his character dies quite early and the rest of the movie is totally forgettable. <br /> <br /> During the Christmas holidays, a group of students volunteers to clean a building belonging to a condemned university from its furniture. A crazy killer, however, puts his hands to the task by methodically crushing the children, one by one, in various horrible ways. <br /> <br /> Exploiting every shot of the book, under the direction of Jeffrey Obrow tells a tedious and unemotional horror that pushed me to pray for the characters to be killed, so that I could continue to watch something more valuable. The majority of the dead (which, let's face it, is the reason we usually watch this kind of movie) are brief and not so bloody; the only truly macabre image ends at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor (there is a particularly bloody and dismembered corpse - the film could have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the movie runs away from the shame of receiving the lowest possible score from me with a nice unexpected ending, but it's really a result for the accomplices dishonest.
