As I watched this movie, I tried to understand why they had bothered to do it. Although the main plot of the film is potentially good, there are all kinds of unrelated / useless sub-intrigues. Marketing executives in Hollywood have had to dictate the multiple bad guys, the double perpetual crosses and the man and the woman who come too close and have sex. It is strange that we see more of them having sex than we did with the president and his mistress. The many intrigues and sub-intrigues make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - I really did not feel like I knew a character, except that everyone is corrupt and perverse. The end is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what could have been, but what was supposed to be. In the end, nothing really explains why anyone does what he does, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross. I am surprised that so many established (and good) actors have agreed to make such a hollow film. It looked like a movie made by students working on their second or third project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you're in a movie class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
