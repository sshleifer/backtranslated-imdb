I just have to add, in case someone reads that and still does not fully understand it. These other critics do not joke, it's really the worst color film you can see. When the film started, I could not believe that something like this was revealed to the world. <br /> <br /> They do not just say it when they said it sounded like a movie at home. It really does. As the "director" took the Hi8 family camcorder (before digital cameras and nonlinear editing on a computer), no other equipment (lighting, sound equipment, etc.) captured decent visual arts students and went to shoot a movie. No script, but just as you go. <br /> <br /> When I watched it, it was on my mono TV. So I have only one audio channel (left of the right speaker). At first, I thought I had a bad connection. The movie was silent until someone spoke for a few minutes. I got up and rolled over the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects, but I could not hear the dialogue anymore. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they are good, kind of thing. I'm not sure it's one of them. I mean, I'll admit that I'm a bit of a budding filmmaker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove that you can do it better, you know. But to look at that made me really sorry for the one who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about it. I thought the girl was hot and I was disappointed by the brevity of her bathing scene. A little T and A of her would have passed the score of anything to maybe a 3 or 4. But alas, no. If you want to make a movie but it turns to shit, add some free nudity. Worked for Roger Corman.
