Hard-boobs, sexy women, many swear words and an unconvincing monster rising from the depths of a polluted lake. You would think that "Monster" would be fun ... but it's not really fun. This stars Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book, it's worth watching at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had made the film, but that Kenneth Hartford - who had directed only the film featuring his children Andrea and Glenn (representing characters tower particularly inventive) - received a full credit. Considering how terrible the end result was, Strock was probably happy not to have been credited! "Monster" looks like a TV movie from the middle to the late 70s. That's why I like to leave it from time to time. As entertainment, it falls flat, but as a reminder to another age and a type of film already gone, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a car chase.
