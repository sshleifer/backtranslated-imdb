It was a film that I hoped to be able to suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish, I knew I could not even look at the damn thing to shut up. You are almost convinced that the war did not last so long. Others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a film like this. But thoroughly, you can not go from watching Saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget the budget difference between the film and the audience - that does not stop a director from making a smart movie. The length of the film is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they continue to attack the same hill but give it different names. I thought the LOC was a terrible lot - this hill looked like my back yard. The character development sequences (the soilders' flashbacks, recalling their last moments, before being deployed) should have been throughout the film and not simply collected in a long memory. To this day, I have not looked at the end yet. But there was a much better movie (do not say much) called Border.
