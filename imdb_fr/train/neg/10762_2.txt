It was an impulsive recovery for me from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake I made. This film is tedious, unconvincing and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and badly pronounced. I cringed at every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes some sparse apparitions and is his usual self-confused; his role was clearly not exaggerated for him. And although the film is supposed to take place in Puerto Rico, it looks much more like a Hollywood movie; all the main characters are Caucasian and many tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. Anyway, when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.
