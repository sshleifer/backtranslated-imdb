OK, so, of course, ppl thought it was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I pity the fools who still think ... It's absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story is right. .. ridiculous. The characters are absurd cartoons - but this movie is not meant to be satire, I'm sure it's a serious drama, is not it? <br /> <br /> Dean and the others are too old for their roles. People say that Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he played his role as well as he could. His character is supposed to be about 16 or 17 years old. But Dean was a 24-year-old when he made this film. To see him agonize and make small tantrums like a 4 year old boy ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the first scenes at the police station where she cries and moans are hardly convincing. This creates a bad precedent for the film ... and for the rest, you want to get angry every time one of these badly played emotional scenes comes up. <br /> <br /> It may have been good for his time, but, really, his fun. <br /> <br /> It must have been a hype around Dean's death that exaggerated the reputation of this film.
