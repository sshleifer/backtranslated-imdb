Well, I, too, had heard all the breathtaking reviews and comments about how this film deserved the Oscar for best film, so I went to see it today. What a major disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you will learn from US Army members who served in Iraq how unlikely the events in this movie are. They reflected my own thoughts. while the film was playing, I - a complete civilian - kept thinking about myself, "say WHAT? There is no way this can happen like that ..." 2) There is very few things really happen in terms of conspiracy. A new bomb destruction officer comes in to replace the one who was killed (a death that is not really explained clearly). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his job. His attitude puts others in danger. THAT'S ALL! 3) This film is far from being as suspensive as it claims. If you want suspense, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a powerful warrior movie, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, which deals with the Vietnam War, and Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONALLY during a chance encounter in a supermarket that he was immensely proud and the one he considered one of his best works, and that he was still upset, had been largely ignored as a result of the apocalypse Apocalypse Now), or an old classic of the World War II, The Bismark, English film, is incredibly heartbreaking. Do not waste your time on Hurt Locker.
