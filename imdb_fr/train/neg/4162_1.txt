If you really enjoyed the movie Resident Evil 2002, you should see it instead of losing 2 hours that you will never find. I can not believe no one commented that this movie is just an economic cheap shot of RE. First, a "special" commando force is the sole defense of an establishment with a computer matrix with AI projection and holographic projection. And this "Hive" scam features a series of traps that inevitably kill one member of the team at a time. There is even a reference to failures in code names, which was in the RE dialog box. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the "Tour", the nemesis of the film, is a kind of bio-creature, a very colorful bucket evoking a necrotic tissue, with many cyborg components, in the same way a super mutant RE. So, a nod to Mr. Richard Taylor for claiming any merit for this story. <br /> <br /> This is not the same movie, of course, but the author had the idea to watch Resident Evil, I think.
