A few years ago, I saw this film as part of a Fast Forward Film Festivals band tradition, where we would rent a group of B-movies and vote for the worst. <br /> <br /> The night we watched this, he was voted the best because of his intriguing appearance and his costumed fun. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a silly, kitsch movie, to watch knowing you're watching low-budget movies. Personally, however, I would not recommend other substances ... this film will leave you with its own mark. <br /> <br /> That left enough to me that I really tried hands on a copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you want to watch bad movies. This one is fun, and I remember a catchy music ...
