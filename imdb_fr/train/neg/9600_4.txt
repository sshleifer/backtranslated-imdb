Very strange, but sometimes elegant, film without a real story, but benefiting from its surprisingly beautiful main actress and a handful of pretty macabre makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful girl in her twenties who carries with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations push her even further to believe that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who would have been called a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a night meeting and is submitted to a hospital. However, she escapes again and devours more men randomly while she is on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's very nice to watch and listen too (soundtrack really great), but the lack of intrigue and continuity becomes irritating fairly quickly. Fortunately, the leader Annik Borel rarely wears clothes and she fills the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The film is too long, too strange and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly, the director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his film is based on real facts. Yes indeed...
