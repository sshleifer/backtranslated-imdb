I wish I could give this film a zero, or even less, because that's what it deserves unfortunately. Honestly, I never go out of a movie, but it was so horrible that I could not bear another minute. Please, please, please - for the sake of humanity - skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie in which you can really dive, that's not it. <br /> <br /> It presents unattractive and unattractive tracks, a jerky structure, a ridiculous dialogue and it is absolutely unconvincing in every way imaginable. . On an absolutely fundamental level, he fails to entertain. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so scenic, it's worse than any student movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, the whole film is based on a constant voice (and I mean constant) on the narration. The writer may as well have written a novel, because he insisted on telling everything, instead of showing it. We are supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends in the world and have a special connection, even though there is no character development to illustrate this. In addition, this film continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, not in a natural way, but in a still image of characters whose name is written on the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters. We do not really know any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm a gay woman who watched this movie with my roommate (another homosexual woman) and we both found that this movie was a depressing representation of queer cinema. I'm starting to think that lesbian and gay movies look a lot like Christian rock - no matter how awful it is, people will still follow and defend it, no matter how poor it is. Please do not rent this !! Instead, encourage the production of high-quality gay and lesbian movies by praising "But I'm a cheerleader," "Fire," or "Heavenly Creatures," instead of swallowing any mindless gut they aim to the gay community. .
