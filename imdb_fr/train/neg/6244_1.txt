Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a definitive, 120-page, line-by-line refutation of this deceptive film, which should be titled "A Convenient Lie". The web site address for his demystification report, entitled "GUIDE TO AN UNCONVENTIONAL TRUTH" by SKEPTIC, is available at www.cei.org. A shorter version of 10 pages is available at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you have read these demolitions, you will realize that the alleged "global warming" is no more real nor as dangerous as the year 2000 scare, which Gore has also endorsed, just like the pseudo-scientific film THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, which is based on a book written by Whitley Strieber, alleged UFO abductor. Like James "The Amazing", Randi speaks to psychics, and Philip Klass to UFOs, and Gerald Posner to JFK's conspiracy-idiotic theories, like Mario Lewis in Al Gore's film and to the scam of "global warming".
