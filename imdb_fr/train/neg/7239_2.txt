This film is presented as an intelligent romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic and it's certainly not an effective comedy. The fortune of the well-meaning but pathetic character, "Tom," varies from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only qualities that save are the competent performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we see the pretty face of Paltrow. Overall, to avoid!
