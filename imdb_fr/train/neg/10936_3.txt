I wanted to love this movie, I really liked it. There are good actors but finally, it falls flat. It's too difficult to be funny in some places (girls for zealous cooking attempts), to others (the scene where they clean someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and some scenes are rather interesting. , are really only loads (all work scenes). And I did not find the "villains" intimidating, nor worthy of being hated, as much as I found them embarrassing child. <br /> <br /> I met people like those in the movie while playing the church ball. And I will say that the referees are on the spot. Yet, in the end, I really did not care much about the characters, or their quest for the glory of the church ball. Maybe because they were all so one-dimensional, which might not have bothered me so much if the movie was funnier or seemed a little easier overall. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm Entertainment have made good films, but that's not the case.
