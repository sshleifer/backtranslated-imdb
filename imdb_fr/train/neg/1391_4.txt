Before this TV movie started, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the broadcast of the last episode of the series and that many of the originals of the series were gone. There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, the penultimate episode of the series, all the regulars, except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, left B-5 permanently. Now, for this film, they have brought Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack. The captain and the doctor make a brief appearance unrelated to the others. But since there is not much old chemistry left, this film is already severely handicapped. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is driven to Babylon 5 in search of a stolen soul globe in a repository hidden by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). There is a lot of spooky mumbo jumbo but, frankly, it was all ridiculous and useless. Yeah, yes, the station almost exploded, but was saved, but frankly, I got the impression that it was a case of "having done that - and it has been much better in the past" . <br /> <br /> The secondary plot, intended more for comedy, was much more interesting, since an entrepreneur had set up a brothel and the commanders did not know what to do about it. with a lawsuit. It was sweet, but it gave a few laughs - something the other dull plot was surely lacking. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen first did a good job playing Should Hunter - with her wild style. the eyes and the weird delivery. However, several times throughout the episode, he broke down. This should have been spotted and corrected. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that it only concerns absolute B-5 nuts (like me). Others seeing it might assume that the series is nil - which is a great injustice. This is an excellent example of a show that does not know when to stop.
