Dorna von Rouveroy's "Intensive Care" is without a doubt one of the worst horror films ever made. This extremely inexpensive Dutch film offers a gore and many absurd situations. lamentable, the action is slow and the climax is laughable.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He is in a coma for seven years, then he wakes up and goes out of his way. "Intensive Care" is clearly influenced by American Slasher movies. including the series "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". The killings are hilarious and the dialogues are painfully stupid.Also, if you're in a good mood, you can take a look at this trash.You're going to laugh until it hurts you a-you can believe me!
