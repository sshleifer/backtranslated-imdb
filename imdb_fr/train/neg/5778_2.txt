Well, I'm dying to see this movie. I'm happy with "who's who" in the horror film that's in the movie ... well, my friend praised this, brought it, and we started to watch it. It's supposed to be a comedy .... I did not smile, even ONCE, until the 40 minute mark. <br /> <br /> Does this relate to the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are movies that cost NEARLY NOTHING ABSOLUTELY, and they are incredible (for me anyway). Also, watching this movie, I could not help but realize the similarities (ie STEALING) with a low budget independent film titled "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my comment about it (it destroys this movie BTW). <Br /> <br /> This movie ... it had potential, really. He had the "star power", a stolen plot (allows you to film behind the scenes of shooting a movie ... that is to say "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, it annoys me more and more, I think about), ... it could have been really funny. LOTS, LOTS of jokes fall flat. The game is good for what it is. But that dragged on, it was not funny, and the plot was totally stolen. <br /> <br /> I give this a two, because it was not SOOO AWFUL, but it's the ONLY reason.
