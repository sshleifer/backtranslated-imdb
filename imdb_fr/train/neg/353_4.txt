As other critics have noted, the movie is dead in the last half hour. However, before that, Kate Capshaw suffers from predictability and a staggering performance, which has clearly never found her character and ruins all the scenes in which she is. Connery is as good as Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated to produce an effect rather than a truth that covers the whole. with a sense of unreality. And the end is just weird. The filmmakers apparently knew, by restoring the mess, that they needed only sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner. So they added a "dramatic" score too heavy. Each little jump is accompanied by a crescendo orchestration, to the point that it becomes laughable. If you want an example of a bad big league movie, it's a sight to behold, if not skip it.
