- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this film because it was a non-WWF fight and so I thought maybe it was fun. It was not. It is unbearable to watch. Embarrassing. Any opportunity for comedy is squandered without mercy. <br /> <br /> I admit I do not like Jack Black anyway. After that, I racked my brains to think of a good role he played. The only thing I can find where he was o.k was a necessary reversal for John Cusack's character in "High Fidelity". Jack Black is one of those ruthless guys (like the fat guy in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who has to be confessed that being stupid is not the same as being funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even embarrassing. It's just irritating. It's not even stupid, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if it tells you anything, I will not rush to find it on DVD.
