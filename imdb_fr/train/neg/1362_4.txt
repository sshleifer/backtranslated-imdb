Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov are a very unlikely couple in a very uncomfortable movie. <br /> <br /> The film is promising for Ustinov who was released from prison for embezzling funds. He convinces Robert Morley to leave in order to assume his identity and start hacking computers in a very classy society run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo for movies. <br /> <br /> Morley sounds right. as he did in 1938 "Marie Antoinette". Maybe he needed to go back to that kind of music. <br /> <br /> This film is ridiculous at best. Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith totally changed her behavior and gave a disconcerting performance to the Oscars in "Miss Jean Brodie's Prime Minister". <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smith is made to be an apparently silly head, but at the end of the movie, she is the brains of the outfit. Too bad the writing did not work with her.
