Released on DVD in the UK under the name of Ax, The Choke is a teenage slasher who fails in almost every department: the story is almost non-existent and gives rise to a film that mainly includes people wandering in a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are obviously intended to be the survivors of the film), everyone is perfectly shocking, which means that the viewer does not care about being slaughtered; the dead are not bloody enough (unless a quick shot of a pound of ground beef covered with fake blood will twist your stomach); and the free sex scene is almost naked (an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher movie!). <br /> <br /> The intrigue as thin as possible sees members of a punk band locked up in what appears to be the world's biggest nightclub (there are innumerable corridors and halls abandoned, unlike all the clubs I've ever seen) where they are abducted by an invisible assailant. For a small budget, the production values ​​are acceptable and the actors all seem to be fairly competent actors, but with very rare true scares, a reluctance to become really messy (it's a slasher, so where are the splatters graphics? ), far too much dreadful dialogue (especially from the not-too-soon-drummer drummer) and the misguided use of mediocre video techniques to try to add style, the movie quickly becomes extremely boring.
