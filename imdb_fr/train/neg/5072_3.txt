And a self-admitted to start. At one point, the doctor's assistant introduces himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> Working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or rebuild brain function, this film does not spend enough time exploring the scene. Most of the time spent on the screen is divided between a domestic quarrel between girlfriends and coma and the pursuit of the murderer of the brain donor. It tries to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller movie but does not achieve any of the three goals. <br /> <br /> As a remake of Frankenstein, all that is original good is missing. No one calls the foolish doctor or even threatens to fire him from the hospital. The scene of the transformation consists of a coma victim who opens an eye and the incredible computer that allows it is not even presented. When the experience works, there is no praise, and when it starts to go wrong, there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any suspense about the identity of the killer is broken by showing him progressively in the same room as all other possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening a file and interviewing someone. <br /> <br /> San Francisco is a decor that is both exaggerated and underused. The opening sequence highlights the fact that this is happening in San Francisco, a cable car plays an important role, the leads live in a Victorian hill, Pier 39 makes its appearance and the final showdown takes place at Golden Gate Park. More precisely along the park, on ten meters of cliff, just enough so that the bridge remains visible at any time. Once the obvious basics of the landscape have been rounded, no further attempts to explore the city are made. <br /> <br /> The acting game is the only grace that saves here. Keir Dullea shows a good range and realizes two truly emotional scenes. Suzanna Love describes the recovery of coma. Tony Curtis receives only a handful of lines and twice as many bad guys watch with most Frankenscience explained by his assistant. The little blond boy also hits his mark pretty well. <br /> <br /> I also gave him an extra star for the scene where the husband left the bridge heading south; it was necessary to turn around in an independent car park. and then he instantly returns to the bridge that leads to the north. It takes a lot of things - courage, ignorance, deadlines - to try to make it pass to the spectator during the only pursuit by car.
