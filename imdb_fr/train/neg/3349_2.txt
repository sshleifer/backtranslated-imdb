I have not read Shirley Jackson's novel yet, which I wanted to do for a long time. I'm sure it must be more scary than this movie. I remember jumping once when I watched it the other day, although I do not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are excellent and I watched this on DVD, but I'm sure the theater was great. After the first special effects, I was waiting for a story to develop. <br /> <br /> I thought this film should at least be based on the classic novel, so there should be a good story. but it was not. Throughout the film, I was forced to look at the beautiful character of Catherine Zeta-Jones because there was nothing else to watch. Lili Talor was a really bad character. I did not like it at all, something about whiny people. In addition, the guy from this movie reminded me of the designer Dudley DoRight with his voice and his face. I could not connect the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting. <br /> <br /> Between half and three quarters of the way Cree the film Queenish! At least there is some kind of entertainment value. If there is no story, at least they will fill it with bloody deaths or pretty women. It had nothing. <br /> <br />
