"Nat" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), his brain friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the still hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what encourages their dreams is that the first spacecraft to land on the moon, the Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad, close to where the three meet. <br /> <br /> The first thing you will notice is the animation of the movie. I thought it was very well done. The landscape was deep, because things in the distance seemed to be behind scenes. I did not see the movie in 3D because it was broadcast on HBO. However, I could see that there were not really any scenes that took advantage of 3D effects, with the exception of a character fight at the end. I was not really impressed by the character design either. For me, they looked nothing like a fly, especially with regard to coloring. The flies were an unusual blue gray that distracted me a little. <br /> <br /> The distribution performances were not bad, but they were not good either. I have often focused more on my computer than on the story. The writing has certainly been written for a younger audience, with funny moments that will make the youngest laugh. I have not seen anything for adults, like jokes about the fact that adults will understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> The story was not followed in this film. In fact, I think this was completely ignored because the main focus was the flies. I also hated when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the fly stories in the movie were a fiction and no fly was on Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration however. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not for the whole family. This is certainly right for children. But, keep it for a rainy day.
