This film is a bad one to rip off on Friday the 13th. The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a camp counselor training camp. He kills people because camp counselor training camp is on land owned by his father. When the police came to take his father's land by force, they accidentally killed his mother (another 13th F takes off). The intro sees Bernie kill his first victims. We then meet a family who camp in the same woods. Shortly after their arrival, they are joined by a strange old man who likes to talk about his son. Later, we learn that his son is Bernie and that he is locked in the back of his caravan after having him out of a psychiatric facility. He places Bernie after the family so they can take their things, and then the lawsuit is launched. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for Level B Slashers.
