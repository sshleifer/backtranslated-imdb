First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Christian Scholl I attended. Needless to say, I was very scared. Not because it was scary, but because the content.Cmon ... I was 7 years old. Anyway, the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was lame. This is very serious since I was only 7 years old and I remember it. The only thing that haunts me again is this terrible song "I wish we were all ready", where the chorus ends with "... you were left behind". I would not suggest seeing this one. I will probably do it, just for nostalgic reasons. In addition, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this film must be when everyone "disappears"; vacant cars are breaking, lawn mowers are doing their own thing ... quite hilarious.
