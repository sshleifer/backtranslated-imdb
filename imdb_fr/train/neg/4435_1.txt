Gods, I have not watched such a dreadful movie for a long time. Maybe not since "The New Guy" or various films by Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, it's as horrible as that. The game in white and wood of Mira Sorvino was surely inspired by Freddie. The staging of the film was awkward (like a play, and this sense of confinement does not work well on a movie). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible and her sex appeal inexistent here, so it was painful to see her "seduce" other characters and they "creaked" for it. And what about the occasional catch of spectators sitting on lawn chairs? Absurd! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would have been painful to self-inflict to finish this movie.
