The film basically tells of the return of a Russian prostitute to her native village for the funeral of a sister / friend. There are a few other minor stories that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. The heart of the film is the funeral, the awakening and, later, the controversy over the future of a community of madmen who make dolls and sell them with the purchase of vodka, but they are now missing the artist who made their dolls salable. Apparently, the film is not edited. The prostitute's journey from town to village is an endless train ride and a walk in the mud. It may be supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and a man, the husband of the deceased daughter. Pursuing the doll business is problematic for all involved and ultimately seems impossible. Most movies are shot with a portable camera that can cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the subtitles do not include the songs and lamentations of the faithful. Do not go in this movie if you do not speak Russian fluently.
