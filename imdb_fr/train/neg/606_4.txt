The potential was there. I saw Creep and I thought several times, "Oooh, it's getting interesting. Yet interesting intrigues have resulted in unexplained or ignored explanations, as never before. The main character was irritating throughout the film, and at one point my friend and I both shouted that we wanted her to die. There are really scary / frightening moments, but these are grossly eclipsed by the moments that have just annoyed me. It's another of those horror movies that pops up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. The movie is the villain, but when the villain is more sympathetic than the main character, you know you're a loser.
