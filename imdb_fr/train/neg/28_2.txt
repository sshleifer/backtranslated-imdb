This film is terrible. You do not really need to read this review further. If you intend to watch it, just say - do not do it (unless you study how not to make a good movie). <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible ... an hour of great amateur. Throughout the movie, I thought it was interesting to find someone who talks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it's him! A new low even for him! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who claim it's original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even with Hollywood action movies, it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not look at him !!! Do a jog instead - at least you will not want to kill yourself.
