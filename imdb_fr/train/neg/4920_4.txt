A modern remodel very neat (sensually keeping the hip) on the story of Dracula (while remaining in traditional customs) with a story interesting enough, if not completely understood, the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to look at it, I could only do it halfway through before losing interest. Once again, it starts well (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their meetings with Dracula), but then, for me, it took less time to focus on Van Helsing's daughter in New Orleans. A good place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite the burning of a paradise in which Dracula fucking could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes, they bear this name there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically, he had his moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic retouches and inexpensive jerks do not help. The messy script becomes considerably ridiculous. Lussier does a neat job that remains rather glassy, ​​introducing a lot of blood (makeup is well done) and a lot of advertising "Virgin". No, I do not mean virgins, it's the music company, because there are a lot of clichés and Helsing's daughter works there too. Oh, it was not easy to plant. The soundtrack is a fun choice of rock melodies. Presently, representations are ubiquitous in the shop, but there are still few known faces (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just does not come because there is not much presence. He was simply amazed by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan Brides Dracula. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably well. Christopher Plummer gives a turn gray while Van Helsing and Omar Epps play with his role.
