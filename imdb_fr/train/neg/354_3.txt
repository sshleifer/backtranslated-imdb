Take a close look at the wonderful assortment of talent gathered to make this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, and even cameos from Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They prove loudly the adage that a good distribution can not save a bad script. The scenario requires so many leaps of trust from the public that its implausibility should have exceeded Hollywood standards. This is not particularly original, and the "twists" are downright cruel.
