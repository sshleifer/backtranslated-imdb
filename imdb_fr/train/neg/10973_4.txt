If you like "Pulp Fiction" and love portable cameras, you should love this movie. I liked the original story (although I think "Pulp Fiction" was the most overestimated movie since "The English Patient") and I found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is not "on the waterfront" or "citizen Kane" and is overwhelmed by the European claim. But the worst, by far, is the portable camera. It's so embarrassing and annoying that I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end. I do not know why new filmmakers think this filming method is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, the portable camera will make you nauseous after about 10 minutes.
