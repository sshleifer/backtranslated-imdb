Go people, you can not be serious, another case of publicity sniffing while it is not totally! It's not even scary, terrifying, or depraved - it's just a horribly terrible amateur video job, designed for the next party so that girls get fired. <br /> <br /> The gore is incredibly bad, even for the eyes. -scene is far from making me want to vomit but just want to take the camera and hit these guys by the head. The girl is lying there, the rubber face, does not move at all. It would have been more fun to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> A season of "I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" is more scary than this one. Do not waste your time and money.
