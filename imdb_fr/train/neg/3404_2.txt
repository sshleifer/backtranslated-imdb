I will not pack this film for all the myriad technical problems, it would take two days to describe how everything is not possible. Others have already pointed out all the relevant stupidities. <br /> <br /> Given all this, I would still have been able to enjoy it, if only they had not included all those crap, nausea, nauseating, sentimental shit from Disney, which is so irrelevant wherever it is, but nowhere else but in space, where the slightest mistake can mean instant death. <br /> <br /> The crew, as well as the "real" astronaut, were also guilty. put all their nonsense ahead of everything else. This completely ruined any value that the production could have kept. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised NASA is leaving this garbage aside so that so many people can get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you have not seen it yet, save yourself the irritation. Look again Apollo 13. At least, that tried to be real.
