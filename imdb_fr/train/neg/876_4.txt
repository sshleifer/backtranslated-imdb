Until the last 20 minutes, I thought it was probably Jackie Chan's worst film (with the exception of his work before 1978, which I do not know well). The last battle sequence changed all that: it's long, good and intense - one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get there, you have to attend a lot of "comedy" that could entertain the five-year-olds (oh, look, someone threw a tomato on that guy's face) and countless "football" scenes . Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a faucet" - watch what is done). "Dragon Lord" is worth being praised for the last fight, but the rest of the film is for Jackie collectors, and even for those who have seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
