The buzz for this movie has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should have continued to remove the script, then the idiotic decor and finally all the visible elements of this film. Because there is nothing else to show. <br /> <br /> Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as generics of this film. I do not really think they exist. I think they bought this script at "Scripts-R-Us", where you buy a standard blank script "Monster Movie" and just fill in the blanks. There is a monster chasing us. Let's split. (In fact, "we separate" in this film). Hit Alien / Giant-bug / Monster / Invisible man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn an enormous bunny / shark / invisible man in an impossible fire. Not dead yet. You know, standard things. Even the minimum number of items specific to an invisible man movie (infrared goggles, paint spray) was poorly managed. <br /> <br /> What's sad is that there were plenty of possibilities for this film to be fascinating. These are psychological problems for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, the treatment of an invisible subject and many other ideas that have been evoked for less than 2 seconds and that would have been much more interesting. If ultimately we wanted to save Kevin Bacon, the film would have been much better. Overall, it stinks. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the end of the film, but I do not want to do spoilers. Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid that they do not think about unplugging the machine rather than ...
