Worst error of my life. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler, I can have cheap laughs". I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the film, my three friends were asleep and I was still in pain. The worst scenario, the worst scenario, the worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to bang my head against a wall for an hour, then I stopped and you know why? Because it was great. When I banged my head, I locked this film in the microwave and watched it burn ... and I felt better than anything I ever did. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill just to overcome this shit. I hate you SANDLER to actually go through with that and ruin a whole day of my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
