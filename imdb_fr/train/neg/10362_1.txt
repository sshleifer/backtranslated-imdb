Disney? What happened? I really wish the film was shot in the '60s, like the book. And I really could have used cheap special effects to save the budget in order to adapt more precisely. Red-eyed man interchangeable in computer science? And what's up with the volcanic upheaval? Where was it in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us!!!! A long time ago (1978), I heard that there was a European version of this film. I wish I could identify it. I can only imagine that it could be closer to reality than this maladaptation. This film must be in X
