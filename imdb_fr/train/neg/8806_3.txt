How could this "Being There" scam be so loved? People say that's the proof that an honest and decent man can succeed despite a lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The film is proof that everything is in luck: hope your friend will invest all your money in Apple and not in Atari; I hope your shrimp boat is the only one at sea when a storm rises; I hope you will not be shocked when, fortunately, you shoot yourself in the buttocks and not in the back. I hope your wife will not get AIDS. This film is also politically reactionary: all those who rebel against social conventions lose their legs, drug, beat themselves, or die young. Plus, the product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film very, very empty.
