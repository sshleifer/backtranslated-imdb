Seeing that the final of the snooker world championship ended prematurely and disappointingly, Ronnie O'Sullivan beating Greame Dott of 18 frames at 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their program and therefore decided to broadcast A WALK ON THE MOON a movie I had absolutely no knowledge off <br /> <br /> I missed a few seconds of the title credits; so I did not know that Viggo Mortensen had starred in it and thought it might be a cheap TVM, certainly the opening with the Pearl mawkish and Marty taking them to the kids who go to a summer camp have this kind of sensation for television although the very bright (overly lighted) cinematography seemed to suggest that it was a cinematographic film and it was not until the appearance of Viggo Mortensen as a hippie Walker type that I realized that C was a movie outing, after all a man of Mortensen's stature would not play in a TVM, I mean, it's like a legend like Robert DeNiro who appears in a movie directly. Wait a minute, Bob ....? <br /> <br /> Some people on this site mentioned that Pearl and Marty were an unconvincing couple on the screen and I agree. I can understand why Pearl would be attracted to an exciting hippie, but I do not know why Walker would be attracted to his wife, Pearl. The sixties were before my time, but if you have a choice between hippie girls and bored housewives, it's not really a choice. Although many people have taken LSD at this time, I guess that explains <br /> <br /> I feel that the major problem of A WALK ON THE Moon is that it is about a romantic drama as you would expect in a TV channel) with several scenes of transition to age so why include a sex scene explicit enough? It mingles with the rest of the film and is perhaps uncomfortable for menopausal women who were 20 years old in 1969. I say maybe because the film also seems to target a teenagers market with the scenes of passage in adulthood and that these adolescents will probably be bored with the historical and social context of the man walking on the moon and in Woodstock. In other words, A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audiences but will probably not please any of them.
