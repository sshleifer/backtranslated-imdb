This film is about Dr. Claw, the scammer Inspector Gadget, who returned after many years in the now peaceful city of Metropolis. Claw's plan is to thwart Gadget once and for all by using a new "coolest" crime fighter to help destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately, the film failed miserably, the series was great, but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, that's not enough. Dr. Claw is not only visually less scary, but sounds more like a cold wrestler, than his own intimidating self. While it is a children's film, but the plot is so painfully weak (God forbid me to mention the animation) that it is derisory compared to the original series. Someone has decided to update Penny also to bring it up to two decades. She now has a quintessential punk style and does not play half of the role she played in the TV series. The discussions on Gadgetmobile, as well as the inclusion of a plot angle that focuses all talking cars from the ON. Maybe I'm just a kid who liked the show and became jaded, but I thought the live version was more painful than I could handle, but now they're going to launch this full dilution of the TV show of quality us. It's more than I can take.
