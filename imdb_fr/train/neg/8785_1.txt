I often comment on critics of really scary movies on the market and, unfortunately, White Noise only served to reduce my belief that the film industry remains capable of leading such a venture. I was surprised to find myself more and more tired as the plot continued and my static-induced headaches increased. I found that White Noise was absurd beyond our best efforts to suspend disbelief. Even after attending the terrible ordeal endured by Michael Keaton, his demise did not affect me at all. Until the credits, I was eagerly waiting for something - anything - of substance to connect to the characters' story, but such relief never happened. Of course, there have been some slow heartbeats, but only because loud noises tend to do so to the stunned spectator. <br /> <br /> While the acting game was nil, Michael Keaton may have played his most studious role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality White Noise has to offer is the stunning architecture of Keaton's two mansions. Overall, White Noise suggests the morbid depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malevolent shadows, fooling the living to follow the dead into their own graves.
