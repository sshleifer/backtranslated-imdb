The supernatural and vengeful policeman returns for a third installment, this time acting as a guardian angel for a female policewoman wrongly accused. Standard image of the stem and the slash, yet well played and directed, which makes it strangely interesting and observable, although the violence is not for the clever (especially the cut of the director who had originally received the note "NC-17"). <Br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
