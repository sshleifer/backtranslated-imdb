This film is awful. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a small town family in the mid-1960s. The father, the school's director, is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a beautiful teacher from the big city who begins to challenge the spirit of her students by offering ideas that inspire thinking, such as thinking for oneself. The director does not agree with her teaching but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. Her teenage daughter (Tara Frederick, Winona Ryder's aspirant) is fed up with the lifestyle of a small town and wants to live. She receives bad advice, frequent bad boys, and apparently, family planning was not taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that the director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked on television, this film is played as a more adult version of a special after school or a very special episode of one of the most mundane sitcoms.
