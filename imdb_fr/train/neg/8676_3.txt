Avoid the USA version. It's with the addition of American footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard, probably done by New York fans. The dubbing is so serious that it looks like the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a Bronx black man is Chiba's voice. I could not watch the whole movie, it was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, look at the biggest names in Chiba, like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
