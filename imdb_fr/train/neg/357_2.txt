JUST CAUSE presents Sean Connery as Harvard Law Professor, Kate Capshaw (does she still have work?) As a woman (slight age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern policeman (! And Ed Harris in a totally exaggerated interpretation of a fundamentalist southern killer of the southern series. <br /> <br /> Bizarre casting, but the film plays the height of the serious with the public. (do not read if you intend to seriously watch this movie or watch this movie seriously because of the spoilers) First of all, I felt myself rolling several times in front of liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and fit that. black guy without proof. The coroner, the witnesses and even the accused's lawyer collaborate against him (he is accused of raping and murdering a girl) because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a Harvard law professional who gives passionate speeches about the injustices against blacks and the barbaric death penalty. The convict's grandmother approached him to defend him and reopen the case. <br /> <br /> Connery is walled up (yawn ...) by the small town officials and the good boys club of IL, but finds that the case against Blair, the alleged assassin, which is found now in the death row, was made. The main evidence was his confession, which had been defeated. <br /> <br /> The shots were inflicted by a black policeman (!) Who even played Russian roulette to get his confession. Connery discovers that another man sentenced to death has committed the murder and, after a few days of reflection with an overprint, Hannibal Lecter, like Ed Harris, he discovers where Harris has concealed the weapon of crime. <br /> <br /> He is the subject of a new trial and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... the movie is over .... <br /> <br /> Then, suddenly! It turns out that Blair IS a psychotic psychopath and used "white guilt" to enlist Connery. He concocted the story with Ed Harris in exchange for some murders committed by Blair. Now, Blair is on the run again, thanks to the crazy principles of Connery's computer! The last 30 minutes. are a strange action film sticking to a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skin house on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades. <br /> <br /> It was a strange movie. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are only bullies and Abu Graib-type executioners, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to be fried. <br /> <br /> depressing at all levels! The system is completely rotten and the types of white guilt from PCs who dispute it are also seriously deceived. <br /> <br /> Two bravo. Connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something like that.
