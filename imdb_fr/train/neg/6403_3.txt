.... about the level of mind on which this comedy works. Barely reaching the length of the feature film, "Can I do it ... 'Until I need glasses' is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can not believe them when you realize that CELA was supposed to be the typing line (example: Santa's gag); others are so long that you can not believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up this punchline (example: the gag of student rewards). And almost all are directed without any artistic talent. Do not get me wrong: about 1 out of 10 jokes gets to be funny (the phone / iron / is probably my favorite). There is also a marvelous, completely frontal nudity that proves, once again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also some comic male nudity). And I agree with others that the title song intentionally stupid is actually quite catchy! But none of these reasons is enough to give this movie anything more than * out of 4.
