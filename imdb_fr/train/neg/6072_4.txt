DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love GOOD sports movies (not so much baseball, but hey, his sports movies, no?). I was expecting MUCH more for this movie. That seems to be starting: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes {which I do not really like} is very good as a spoiled star. For me, Barkin's role was OK. She's a good actress, but she seemed out of place in this role. For me, they always seemed to rush the scenes, then it dragged a little in places. It seemed so uneven! Given the cast and the plot, it could have been so much better. I rated it "4" and I was generous ~ I'm a tough guy with numbers!
