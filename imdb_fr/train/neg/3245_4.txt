The film debut of David Mamet has been hailed by many as a real man-made film, a film that makes you question everyone. I saw it for the first time recently and I could not understand what was supposed to be so great about it. <br /> <br /> The film is about a psychologist named Margaret, who is also a successful author. Margaret is disappointed with her job and her inability to really help someone. She tries to remedy the situation by helping the patient settle her gambling debt with a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this movie). She discovers that Mike is in fact a professional trustworthy man when she is almost scammed and immediately fired after meeting her. Intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show him how the crooks work (she plans to use this as a subject of a new book of psychology). She falls in love with him and accompanies him in a long con that he and his associates have set up. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go into details, but at the end of the film, it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were a ploy developed by Mike and his acolytes to scam Margaret up to $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First, the big turn towards the end was VERY predictable. All the scenes in which the crooks worked were made very obvious by the theatrical play and the strange line readings. Not only that, but the public (and the main character) know they are dealing with crooks, so is it really such a big surprise to find that Margaret herself was cheated? Also, Margaret is supposed to be an intelligent psychologist, a reading expert, but she's too easily fooled - and remember she knows that Mike is a crook. <br /> <br /> Second, we are led to believe that Margaret was deceived from the beginning, but for the scammer to work, she had to do several things that the scammers could not have predicted. First, she had to decide to help pay off her patient's debt, which allowed her to meet the crooks in the first place. If she had not done that, all the crap would have failed. I just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to pay for a patient's gambling debt. Not only that, but what are the chances that crooks are in the right place the same evening she decided to show up? Did they just show up at this bar every night and hope she came to see them? Another thing that should have happened that could not have been predicted is that Margaret had to come back to Mike again and ask him to teach him the ropes. What are the chances of this happening? And yet, all the con is based on this principle. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had is the end. Margaret discovers that she was fooled and decides to take revenge on Mike. At first, Mamet lets us believe that she is going to go after the scammer, but that falls, so the ultimate denouement is his shot to Mike in an airport baggage storage area. In a way, it seemed like an awkward and inept way to end a movie about the crooks who practice their craft. Not only that, but she did not even take back the money he stole from her. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film leaves you feeling empty and dissatisfied. And if, like me, you predicted in advance that Margaret was going to be deceived, you will find that this revelation is just as unsatisfactory.
