The first film of Bo Derek remained invisible for eight years ?? and that's how it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor but, as a director, he is practically the Ed Wood of erotic cinema ?? This is not that it is particularly explicit, since Bo (who has atypically sporty black hair) was only 16 at the time of shooting! John also wrote and photographed it. the latter gives some decent images of the Greek island on which the story is built ?? but the plot is childish and the dialogue atrocious! <br /> <br /> The character played by Peter Hooten was raised in Bo's family: they grew up as a brother and sister, but, now in their teens, the couple discovers that they are attracted to it one by the other (but, as I said, do not expect a sexual firework!). Yet, the worst part is the fact that the protagonists each maintain an obsession throughout the film that is not only silly in itself, but irritating in its relentlessness ?? Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modern seaside resort and still expects a cruise ship to appear (which, of course, occurs in the final); Derek is even more crazy? she wants a big antique bathtub !! For the record, the couple is married at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The mayor of the city and a photographer, Lothario, are also involved in these events. who, of course, incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten). From time to time, without any valid reason, we are even entitled to excerpts from the screening of old Hollywood classics in an open-air theater where the whole city meets (among the titles presented is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [ 1931])! At the end of the day, if Bo's naivety is undeniably charming, it is not enough to counterbalance the monotony and the amateur character of the film.
