I remember very well Bo Derek's heyday and the attention of the British press (especially the sly newspapers of Sun & News of the World), who all followed his small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Naturally, her photogenic face, her limpid blue eyes and her perfectly trained breasts made a lot of stories. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, playing is, and never was, his forte! I think they should make one of the triple disc collections that you will always find in the bargains of DVDs - Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these films could be nominated for the movie "So Bad They Are Great". <br /> <br /> That would be a culprit "must buy" mine! If you ever read your press, or this comment, Mrs. Derek, do not be offended - you always have a weakness, and there are things in the world that worry you more than your acting abilities. A lot of love.x
