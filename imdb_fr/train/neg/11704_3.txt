One of them, "Why was it made?" movies. Romance is very difficult to swallow. It's one of those novels, that, suddenly, "click" - they are in love. The film is filled with long breaks and uncomfortable moments, the restaurant with driving service being the most remarkable. Charles Grodin does a credible job but for most of the film, there is only him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself if you want to watch Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with his neurosis together for an hour and a half.
