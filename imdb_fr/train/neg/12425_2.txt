I do not know what you breathe, but please stop. Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was adorable, cute, kind, affectionate and extremely fun to watch. He had that innocence, but at the same time he was so strong. <br /> <br /> This new kid, Alex? Boring like all hell! Just a flagrant scam to try to match the charm and grace of Culkin, failing miserably at that. <br /> <br /> The wicked, shit full. Harry and Marv, they formed a fun team on the screen. They were comical, humorous and made you really want to root more for Culkin, what a good villain is supposed to do. These guys, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, are absolutely PERFECT for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who bicker and still try to capitalize on the charisma and charm of the first bad guys. Do not say they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really entertaining. More on the nerdy side actually. <br /> <br /> Then we have the real movies. Part 1 and 2, classics. Memorable. Perfect for looking around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out many emotions. You fall in love with the story and you care about the characters. Simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? Masterpiece of shit. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Everyone, I do not know why people like that. I think people do not really know what a good movie is anymore. It's a shabby continuation with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new kid that I'd like thieves to break down at least. <br /> <br /> Run, run away. And do not even start with part 4!
