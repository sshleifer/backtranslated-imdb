"It's not like this big mechanical toy," said a character at the beginning, commenting "Jaws". "Blood Surf" would only like to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are terrible. Playing and directing are not much better either; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble gum ad than to a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but also for the public. To say that you have "liked" this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this shit, further destroying the horror genre. (* 1/2)
