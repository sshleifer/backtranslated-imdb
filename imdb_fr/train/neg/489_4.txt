The acting is good, the women are beautiful and the men are beautiful, so if you are looking for soft porn well played, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you waste your time. The motivation of the main characters, especially the eponymous paw, is often a mystery. She could have just told the truth - the truth as presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared a prison sentence for a rape he did not commit. Did she protect her father, who was half armed when he impulsively launched a malicious trial? Was she protecting herself, with her suddenly worrying reputation, when only her art seemed to matter? During the trial, this strong-willed woman boils before our eyes. Conversely, his lover, who begins as a narcissistic idiot, becomes a disinterested hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Of course, as no good deed should go unpunished, we are told that she will never see it again.
