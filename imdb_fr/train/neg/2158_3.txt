I can now clearly see why Robin Hood collapsed quickly. The first episode of this movie is probably the worst thing the BBC has ever shown. The opening scenes were about as intense, meaningful, and intelligent as two fighting monkeys, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword fight was simply laughable. The worst moment of the episode was Robin Hood who kissed a cow made up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eye tracers in the 12th century? Nobody. The series may have improved drastically since then, but this first episode quickly put hopes aside and was a pile of creations. A great hero from England has been dishonored. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to tolerate that?" I will not, for sure, unless the BBC begins to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
