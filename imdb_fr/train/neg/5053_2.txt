I read another review that Platoon was an endless cycle of marines killing people, getting killed, taking drugs and speaking badly. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with that because the movie actually had more, but it's a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: it did not have any real conspiracy - which is a point with which I agree. <br /> <br /> It is a complacent stone at home better. He really wanted to show, not only how the war led to death, but how it was extremely traumatic for those who survived. Unfortunately, the film seems too "glorify" this aspect and the grand finale is too much champagne, Oscar hunt "create a lasting image" to my taste. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers of its kind is that they fail to understand this simple concept: depict the terribly bloody waste that is NE war DO NOT PROVE, or even think about the fact that it was an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge right now with Iraq. If you miss the problem, let me tell you straight away: if you saw how bloody and destructive World War II was for the lives of surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If this fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, why then would the description of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in this case? <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support the decision of the United States to go to war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not subscribe to the theory "this war is false because people died and suffered ". I do not think motivations are always wrong by default, just because the war is terrible in itself. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that the end or the last big "twist" was a little stupid. However, this is not the first odd departure of Stones. Wall Street was a beautiful movie, until about the last 30 minutes, when it made a terrible "bad turn". JFK is probably one of the few films made by Stone that ended very well. <br /> <br /> But that does not matter in this one, because there was very little plot so far. And that's why I gave him a low note. It was practically boring and ultimately boring - unless you fall in love with what you make.
