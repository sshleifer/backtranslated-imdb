Have you ever seen a movie made up of long, wide shots? No? Neither do I. Well, I finally saw one in "Spring in my Hometown" (spring in my hometown) and I must admit I now know why people do not do it. The technique is "arty", of course, but it's certainly not ripe for public consumption. The technique is very imperfect simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps this is the intent of the director. I do not know, I can not read minds and I certainly do not know enough about the director to be able to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> But one thing that is painfully obvious in this movie is its ridiculous. anti-American feelings. As an American, I am well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War and I know very well that we were not always angels, but I do not care that I'm going to take the version of this type arrived. According to this blind fool, the Americans were not only at the origin of the war, we were the cause of the war and we almost destroyed the country by themselves. It does not matter, Mr. Director. And I suppose you would still do this film in CORE COMMUNISTE if we had not interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your story. It's almost like making the Nazis "good" while turning the Allied forces into "bad guys". This film is so historically naive and factually inaccurate that it is almost embarrassing to watch it. For a man who comes from a country that owes his EXISTENCE to American interference, he is certainly high, powerful and insightful.
