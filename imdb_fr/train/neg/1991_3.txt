So, what is the point of making a wannabe INDIANA JONES when you have an actor who presents himself as a fictional dude of adventure storybooks who does not want to go on an adventure ??? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for all the reasons, the film lacks a lot of excitement! This does not mean that it has no action, but look at the dark side of the image. This has nothing to do with resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action-adventure sensations containing narrow cliffhangers and escapes, and JAKE SPEED has been promoted this way using smart propaganda so that I and many others are interested! Besides, I have never heard of this guy, so who needs his attention?
