** HERE AND SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Reminder: Mia (Helin) returns from the capital Stockholm to the Rättvik campaign to celebrate her 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest of the children and has two sisters, Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla divorced and moved a town. Mia is still single and focuses on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise throughout their confrontation, each with personal problems difficult to manage. As the party progresses (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets are unveiled and more and more conflicts occur ... see this movie to follow exactly the same tracks as Old comedies / Swedish dramas have been following for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This film is based on three fundamental areas. 1) An embarrassing humor based solely on characters who ridicule themselves. 2) grief and 3) anxiety. This movement focuses on the latter, almost forgetting the first point as the film moves forward. No loss however, because the humor is not funny. The performances of the actors are good, I suppose, although they are lost behind all anxieties and quickly forgotten. I was hoping there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. To conclude, there are better ways to spend your time than to look at this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
