When I saw the previews of this movie, I was not expecting much - around a second-rate horror movie for teenagers. But wow, this movie was absolutely awful. And it's generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, the cast of the movie was terrible. You do not feel any sympathy (or any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I just waited and hoped that this horrible thing would end. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are points in the movie that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Can anyone please explain to me why the boy with the girlish appearance starts to shout "PANCAKES !!!" breathless on entering Jackie Chan, movements I had never seen before, and biting the guy who has the virus even more? Why does the child's father begin to get angry at the virus-infected guy and go out looking for a hunt to find him? I ended up with such a sense of confusion and absolute disbelief that I literally said aloud, "Where did it come from?" <br /> <br /> I just could not not believe what I had seen. I really thought I saw bad movies, but I must say that Cabin Fever outperforms them all. This film made me want to vomit and then vomit again. So blow my brain. <br /> <br /> Please, spare yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching the grass grow may be a good alternative.
