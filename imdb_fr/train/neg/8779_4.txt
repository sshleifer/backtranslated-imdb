As a movie fan, White Noise was a complete disappointment. As a filmmaker, the cinematography was pretty good, well lit, the work of the camera was good, the direction reasonable. But as a film, it seemed just as predictable as all the other so-called "horror" movies that the market has recently flooded. Although it had a little "cooling factor", the concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not seem credible. This film did not explain the reasoning of certain occurrences but pursued them. The acting was far from breathtaking, the main character portrays no emotion, like many recent thrillers / horror films. <br /> <br /> Decidedly, this is not a film that I will buy on DVD and I would not recommend anyone to rush to see it. .
