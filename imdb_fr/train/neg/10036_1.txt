Sometimes I can not understand what filmmakers think when they make a film ... I had a trauma after watching Welcome (2007) and I thought they would not do it anymore. But after many incredible promos, Tashan finally ended a heart attack. <br /> <br /> These 3 incredible songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero history, predictable plot, many waterfalls of Akshay Kumar and nothing of interest apart from watching Kareena after his major weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Musically, another major disaster ... in the album, they spent time giving small pathetic dialogues of these 4 jokers and they did not think to give the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar makes stunts ...! this song is so beautiful, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and not taken in the album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I would say, look at it to listen to this song that looks like ... "Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ..." <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm disappointed. the way Bhaiyyaji tried to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away, man, I must vomit!
