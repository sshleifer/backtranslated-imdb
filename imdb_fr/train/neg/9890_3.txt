Another rape in history <br /> <br /> This film is a disaster. he simply uses a historical story and makes a sweet love story, with bad action and low-budget production. <br /> <br /> The film should be 1/3 of the time, they just dragged the time to do a mini series. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, the soldiers are stupid, the costumes are a disaster. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest. In this film, the Romans chose to fight in the city, I mean, become real. <Br /> <br /> By the way, Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, that is, a light-skinned person.
