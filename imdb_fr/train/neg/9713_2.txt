The first time I watched Cold Case, it was after about a year of broadcasting on Danish television. By the time he arrived on television, he almost drowned himself in 4 or 5 other US television series. At about the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was bored with dying. The inferior actors with honest faces and morals were a pain in the backside. It is highly unlikely that a team of investigators would have had such a sum of money to solve murders committed between 10 and 20-30 years, or even 60 years. <br /> <br /> Time is also an important factor because they are only 50 years old. -60 min to tell the story, which means they get a break just in time to resolve the case and do justice to surviving family members, if they are still alive. This, combined with the "personal" problems and the investigators' relationships, MUST have time to leave the show completely dull. <br /> <br /> I give it a rating of 2 stars because of the music that I finish. which is really the only reason to look at it .... which of course you will not do while it's too lame to watch that shit.
