The film is bad. Nothing special - just a movie "for kid" without any serious problem. There is however a reason to watch this: the animal's speech. Some of them are so funny in what they say, you can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in the pound, say, "I'm Keyser Soze," or some other animal say, "You're a dead cat that's walking," or a lot of other funny trolls, see it. Because there is no other good movie to watch. Vote: 4 out of 10
