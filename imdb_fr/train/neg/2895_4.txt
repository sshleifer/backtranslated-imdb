The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that does not degrade. But the film does not succeed. Instead, he plays for 45 minutes, nibbling around a preamble before making the big discovery. Since viewers do not benefit much from seeing a fanciful little boy solve the problem, the choice is strange: the movie was prevented from dealing with any subject. Once the fabric has been discovered, the film establishes too quickly that both the wholesalers of the industry and the blue-collar workers want the invention to be crushed, leaving the film with only two fragile movements; invent the chemical and flee the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why someone would call it comic. The tone is not funny or comic. This is more like a serious social criticism of the day: capitalism distorts both supply chains and production. This prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, it's probably true, but without a certain attitude in this respect, the film is simply a serious argument. You will need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find one here. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like a British meet John Doe (Nigel Doe?).
