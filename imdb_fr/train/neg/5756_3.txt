This should be a good movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-starred with two reporters. Mike Nichols realizing. Uh It's drab dull terne! Useless and predictable! Slow and blurry! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter 'a boy meets a girl, a boy marries a girl, a boy has a story, a girl leaves a boy's story. This is an original concept! After spending two hours squirming (was it only two o'clock, I felt like it was six o'clock). I did not know if it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. That was done in 1986. I'm sure we all did things sixteen years ago that we would rather forget. I hope that the damage to Streep et al's reputation begins to subside and that the emulsion on the master begins to fade. It's not that it's such a bad image. It's just that it's so bad.
