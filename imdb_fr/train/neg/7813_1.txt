In my eyes, it's almost the perfect example of the Hollywood ego, beaten only by the new movie King Kong. Superman is the original superhero and deserves to be treated with respect even if he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen. Since the beginning of the movie, you just want to stick a piece of kryptonite in your throat. He just looks silly to wear the costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, she is supposed to be a tough journalist, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, he's actually the son of supermans, who would have never thought ....) and the acting was horrible. This film has a good side, and its name is Kevin Spacey. His interpretation of Lex Luthor was brilliant but he could not even save this film. This film needed the distribution of "laws and clark" (except Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story. I watched this film after seeing "the hills have eyes" and I was shocked to learn that there were worse films than that.
