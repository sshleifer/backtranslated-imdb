Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his interpretation of GIDEON. This film could have been a classic if Lambert had played as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn in Sam Dawson on I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Too bad because the storyline is meaningful to us in life, the secondary performances of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excellent. 3 out of 10
