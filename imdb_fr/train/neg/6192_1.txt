The great ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a bad film in all respects. Scenario, slow pace, lack of depth in any character, useless side-tricks, dramatic play, useless climax, make this movie the worst movie I have ever seen. I did not find anything nice, pleasant or intellectual stimulant. <br /> <br /> I imagine that the filmmakers thought they were doing something clever and dark, with their moody lighting, their long silences and their classic soundtrack. If so, they have completely failed. It bothered me and I would never have looked at it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
