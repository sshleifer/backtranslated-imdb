"National Lampoon goes to the movies" is the worst film of all time, even exceeding the "Plan 9 of outer space" without intelligence. At least this movie was just inept; the film Lampoon, on the other hand, is both inept and nasty. Once upon a time, movies respected the intelligence of their audiences. The latter, however, is wearing a decaying carcass, and then tries to rub our noses on it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the film are the nude scenes; and I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry blink a little flesh, and it's a very beautiful flesh. But filmmakers do not seem to realize that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. None of this here. <br /> <br /> Perversely, filmmakers keep the worst for the end. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays the role of an impatient young police officer who comes to work from his first day of work. He is associated with an exhausted and cynical veteran played by Richard Widmark. For a moment, we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly. We think of course that the boy's casual attitude will erase the cynic and change him into a better one. <br /> <br /> Hope lost! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the youth's spark is stifled forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and goes straight to the toilet, asking us to follow them into the sewers. Nominally, it's a comedy. But where is the humor?
