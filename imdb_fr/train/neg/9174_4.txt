I usually like zombie movies, but this one was just bad. <br /> <br /> The good sides: a girl swimming without panties with a thong, Sonya Salomaa in topless and Ona Grauer's breasts stirring in a lean high. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many video cuts, too much Matrix in slow motion (it trails the action), not enough blood and guts, bad acting and no history. The only other person in the theater was smart and left just after the topless swim scene. A total waste of $ 6 and time. I give it a 2 out of 10.
