Not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought. I really did not feel ripped off my rental money, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing shiny or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The staging is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the effects of werewolf, which in a werewolf movie, is a very big problem. There was a pretty good nudity, which for me is a very good thing, but it was not that hot. All in all, it's a fairly average live movie for video, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen and if you're bored by a genre fan, watch it one day. I would even watch it again. <br /> <br /> As a bonus for the geeks of horror, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few) plays the werewolf.
