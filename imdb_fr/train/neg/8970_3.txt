The first movie Cube was an art film. He set up a world in which all the major archetypes of humanity were represented and showed how much they struggled to make sense of a hostile world they could not understand. It was, at the non-literal level, a plot "man against cruel nature", where the individual who represented innocence and goodness ended up triumphing to face a new and indefinable world beyond the small quarrels of man ; a world where there was no longer a struggle, but peace. I rated Cube as 10 out of 10, and it's a movie that was never designed to have a sequel. <br /> <br /> The second film, Hypercube, was a huge disappointment. Some of the ideas were pretty cool, but in the context of the original film, the story and the background had no meaning or meaning. Nevertheless, to be quite entertaining, I gave it a rating of 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third film, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second one, unfolds like a commercial film of very poor quality. less than the first, without the symbolism. There is no "homage" or "homage" here; there is only the scam. Same type of intrigue, with some elements altered so stupid (like having letters instead of prime numbers between cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that it is a scam without any originality and without anything to say). <Br /> <br /> What we saw something "behind the scenes" means nothing, because observers are only part of the Big Bad Experiment, architects, we hear nothing. And, in this film, those who reach the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first film) have just been killed - where does the * bleep * make sense ?! It's just flippin 'stupid. I'm glad I did not pay to see that. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of production and acting in Cube Zero are not so bad, but the story and ideas are so devoid of any inspiration that this movie can get me a score of 3 out of 10.
