The trio of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play the role of the Coney Island carnies in search of the hand of Ginger Rogers, a girl selling taffy in salt water. With the outbreak of the First World War, the trio enlisted and pursued Ginger from afar. The first half of this production of RKO Pathe is difficult, the three men in the lead blocking the scene with overcooked linings and a 'catchy' dialogue that quickly becomes tedious. The second half focuses on action sequences while the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a submarine. These sequences are lively and well filmed, but overall, it is a dramatic comedy too long and unsatisfactory, with a flat end. For star fans only.
