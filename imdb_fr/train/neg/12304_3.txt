Last week, I watched this movie and had the biggest laugh in my life. The plot of the movie is pretty stupid and complicated in a poorly designed way. The only advantages that can be found in the film are the impressive abs of Corey Savier. Alexandra Paul (I think that's her name) is horrible as a preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is disgusting and his character is a twit on the whole thing. And as if the fact that you thought she was having sex with her son was not enough, they add unnecessary sax solos on every occasion! The end and the climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable. I mean who the devil wants to bring the child of a scammer who tried to make you believe that he was your son and that you have an incestuous relationship with him!
