Another movie Priyadarshan / Vohra is another film that has been seen for TP rather than for real desire. The only reason I saw this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but it goes without saying. This film was not expecting me much. <br /> <br /> I was happy with the casting in general, except Rajpal Yadav who, once again, does not get excited, he extracts some laughter, but it was slapstick classic jokes original , in fact, all this film is like playing dhol, I mean that it takes hardly a talent to make noise, or even to play the right rhythm on the dhol for a little while, is not it ?? They are the ones who can wear different times sequentially, over a prolonged period of time and are considered excellent. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires talent, it has no variations and the monkey dance (hmm looks like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it is not an instrument that will entertain you for a long time or even make you dance like the Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This film looked like dhol and dumroo, sometimes the dhol was sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but especially the Dumroo was playing alone and the monkey was dancing. And like all 24 year olds, sooner than later, I got bored. <br /> <br /> The film contains some good moments Dhol (good) but after a while, all I heard was the boring Dumroo (fun at first, then tolerable, then irritating). ), the big regular pieces really guarantee that this movie is mainly good for some fun clips on "MOTHER BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you have not watched it, watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evening and is really quite funny ). <br /> <br /> This film had its moments, the actors did a good job, with the exception of Rajpal Yadav (who can play, I saw him in Main Meri Patni ??) who annoys more that entertains, I repeated it many times and I repeat it. I really think that Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a great career ahead of them in multi-stars comedies in particular. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really funny. such as unsuccessful attempts to impress the father of girls, the wacky women try to woo the girl and keep her away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after, it was over A failed attempt to turn this movie into a lot more with added mystery, it means that once the girl was in, the next 45 to 60 minutes were more and more agonizing, the highlight was "LIKE BAD GOOD CATEGORY", I mean something thinking that if you had to have a tight end, at least try to make it palatable. <br /> <br /> The movie is also extremely predictable, there is hardly any scene you can predict and you will not be bursting with spontaneous laughter. Here, it's more like you see him coming and start laughing almost before the gag. <br /> <br /> The film follows a gradual decline over the movies, with the exception of the odd bump, downward or upward, then quickly tumbles once they made friends with the young girl. <br /> <br /> Most really bad scenes took place towards the end, the movie trying to be more than an ordinary comedy, many jokes were very bland and stinking repetition, THE LAST 10- LAST 15 WERE ESPECIALLY DISTATE AND COMPLETE THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> I did not find Tanushree Datta as the mermaid she had to play, and her acting skills are seriously questionable, especially considering her unattractive appearance, if you do not can not be a HOT. and you can not play how long you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically too, this film was weak, with constant female eyes, poor lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> The songs with the exception of the title track are not good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half, I could feel the collective breath of the public. <br /> <br /> In a film that is simply ordinary because of the casting, and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoiding it will not be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if you have to watch it for free on TV, a very cheap morning or something, if you pay the full multiplex rate, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> - lots of reassuring jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST MINIMUM 45 AND LAST 15 MINUTES, technically, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s tries to be more than he is Tanushree Datta. <br /> <br /> + some good scenes to the beginning, title song, good acting and casting except RY. <br /> <total 4.5 / 10 (I try to be objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this film has met my very low expectations, so I give it the benefit of all the doubts , on absolute terms this film was not more than a 4)
