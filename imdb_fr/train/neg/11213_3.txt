OK ... I watch a lot of bad movies. I am proud of that fact. often, there are gems in bombs rated B. But this film is one of the worst I've seen. I like a good horror movie ... but with a plot and a sense of movement. The opening scenes seemed pretty good. Music and decent pictures. Then he goes down the hill. One of the main characters is disabled (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret. They made this an overly important topic in the film. So what he has in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere he should not have been. No need to keep talking about it. So this guy has an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head against the table. So, instead of letting everyone know about his adventure, he decides to empty the body. Now, her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what has happened to her. Well after seeing her sister again and again (like a zombie like a ghost) and even having directly indicated the location of the body, she finally found it. Now the body is found and she is prepared to face the one and only suspect who killed her. The bad thing is that she did not have a lot of plan. Only to pretend to be his twin and meet the guy where the body was thrown. The idiot did not even think he killed her. So everything is revealed and even if she had a rifle ... she managed to get strangled. The last scenes of the film show the "spirits" of her and her twin coming out of the water. So, you mean that in this movie, the villain wins. And not one, but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film: images <br /> <br /> Negative points of the film: long and imprecise musical sound effects of some actors not all
