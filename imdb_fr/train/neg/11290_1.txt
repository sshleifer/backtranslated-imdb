By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yappt Kotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the movie was originally called "The Treasure" but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". I think sharks were in a scene in this movie; the fact that they found themselves in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets. Did not work Whenever something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew is talking to a certain brand of beer that had just been presented at the time the film was shot. Gee, do you think the beer could have been a sponsor? Could they have made it more obvious? The only time someone should get out of the beer is if he manages to get out of it. It's enough for the party.
