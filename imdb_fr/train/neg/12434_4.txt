In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "Airplanes, Trains and Automobiles", a hilarious and poignant comedy ?? the best thing he has ever done. Ten years later, he is forced to retrain the plot of 'Home Alone' in this second sequel, which is not related to other films, but is also uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks ?? it's true, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change in the series! ?? are electrocuted with metal chairs, dumbbells with dumbbells and paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the newborn is even less charming than Culkin. One would think that the departure of almost all the key actors of the first two films would prevent Hughes from fossilizing the same routines, but the only surprise is that he did not even play for "Home Alone 4".
