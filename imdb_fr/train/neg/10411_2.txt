It's funny. I have seen many of Fassbinder's films and some of them are extremely creative and interesting, while others are loathsome and complacent, like this movie. For me, it goes from the top to the shit - without a lot in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among the "sophisticated", but I can not help but think that its appeal is largely a hype. From my point of view (and I know I'm going to get a lot of negative reviews about it), he shot too many movies too fast and was too complacent. His gay or genre films (like this one) tend to be really bad - neglected, sometimes quite boring (like PETER VON KANT's QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS) and sometimes just plain (like this movie). Could not his message about accepting a person's sexual confusion be treated better than showing him that he is being slapped or that cows are being slaughtered? Be sensitive about the subject and make your characters more human and more understanding - so maybe I would be interested in movies. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I am honestly aware of not worrying more about Fassbinder movies - the bad seems to outperform the good.
