This film was rather a disappointment. After the very slow start, very intense (and pretty gore), the film begins to lose. Too much intrigue leaves too little time for explanations and, when I left the theater, I wondered what it was. The characters remain shallow, the story is not convincing at all, it is mostly stuff already v√π without any hint of parody, and there are very tacky passages ... Like, the young policeman must dig up a body. Of course it's night AND it's raining AND he has to do it alone ... yawn! Or The Manifestation of Evil being "Nazis" plus a "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, it's really original. There are, however, some interesting elements, such as the fight scene, the mountain view and some gags (running), but (although Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can), this does not matter. definitely not worth it.
