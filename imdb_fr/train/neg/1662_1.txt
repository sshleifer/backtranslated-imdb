It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This gives your TV movie series a Reservoir Dogs look. According to a book by the one and only Britney Spears and her mother, Virginia Madsen (without hope that you were well paid) did everything to save him. The story of a red-necked peasant earning a scholarship at a prestigious music school is little more than a way to pedal music for the consumer and to generally agree that Thin eyebrows must be addressed. There is nothing good here with rhythms as predictable as the night that follows. Never again.
