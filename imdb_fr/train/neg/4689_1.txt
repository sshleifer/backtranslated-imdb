Really horrible film directed by Ted Tetzlaff, filmmaker turned director. Good-looking film but for a time bomb movie totally devoid of tension. Ford, as someone said here, sleepwalking if this one with his characteristic smile. Some details were revealed - ex-Canadian army or the RAF, bombs defused during the war, his wife leaving him - but none of this is anything. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this cargo of mines? By the way, what period are we talking about here? Second World War or post-war? I took this last point, which makes the bomber's motive even more striking. In general, though, it's just a horrible movie. There are many good time bomb movies to ignore this one. Watch any episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting moment, at about the same time.
