Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, that's certainly the case after this endurance test of a movie. How on earth did I manage to continue without touching the fast-forward button that only the Lord knows. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me !! Maybe I do not understand the principle of the film ... or maybe I do not appreciate its so-called mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were all awful and the drawing of Tom & Jerry develops more. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do it? Why do I look at such guts? Just run away and join a monastery or foreign legion !! YAARGH !! A film absolutely horrifying in almost every respect. Other than that, it's not so bad.
