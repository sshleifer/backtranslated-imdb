Really terrible, pretentious, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems to love the pretty face and silhouette of his actress Detmers - who can blame him? But perhaps, perhaps, he should have focused a little more his attention on making a good film engaging. I hate when a sex movie comes up as a "movie of art" just to become more "respectable". Frequent sex scenes, sometimes hot, are the only reason for the existence of this film. Whether it's worth it or not to figure in the rest of the photo is a matter of taste. (*)
