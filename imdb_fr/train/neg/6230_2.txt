I was a little interested in this movie as a trash cannibal movie. I was completely disappointed. it's the same kind of disappointment as feeling "Friday the 13th: Jason takes Manhattan". so much wasted potential! <br /> <br /> The opening scene attracts attention. so he stops. Hearty breasts and an inordinate 80s fashion can not help this movie. the only things to eat near this island of cannibal monks are the piranha! I do not ask for the level of gore "cannibal holocaust", but I was looking for a gore of abusive exploitation at a cheap price. I did not have anything of that. <br /> <br /> I found some scenes of somewhat intriguing fights, hence the 2 stars. I do not think it's really worth the time it takes to watch it, though. I could show it at a party where nobody cares what's going on and you just want something in the background. but I would not tell anyone, "Oh, man, you GOTTA see this movie." it is neither good enough nor bad enough to deserve much attention.
