I must admit that this version is a shame for Shakespeare! No one can act except the nurse who was my favorite! Juliet had good skills in adolescence, but she can not give emotional depth to her lines and we really can not connect to her. She is worse off when she plans to drink the sleep potion ... God stop crying! I would have poured in her mouth to silence her! Anthony Andrews ... yuck! Considering his other great movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he is rather shocking in this one. And do not get me started on Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It is always good to see if you are looking for all the Romeo and Juliet in the history of the film. The version of Olivia and Leonard is always the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard, then the current Leo and Clare!
