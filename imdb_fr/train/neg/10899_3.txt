History and actor cheap and incredibly boring. Not a single good line, not even a line bad enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the reel included in the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how amused they were. The esoteric and occult base was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists were neither frightening nor credible. The "homoerotic" nuances were unnecessarily tame and unsatisfactory and were limited to young boys stroking their chests while flabby in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little action might have at least prevented me and my girlfriend from sleeping.
