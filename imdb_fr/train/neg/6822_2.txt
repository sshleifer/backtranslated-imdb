Drones, ethnic percussion, bad synthesizer piping, singing kids. The most condescending "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist film, and a ugly one. What really kills are the inconsistent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc. No transition, no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, no idea expressed in pictures. Just a bunch of third-world images with "baskets on their heads" as another commentator has said. Endless walking as if it had a deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a music video of 3rd World, all they had to do was go a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya had been shot and filmed in Mexico. It would have been a much better setting for "life in transformation." <br /> <br /> But no. What they have decided is a scrambled tourist route that covers half of the globe and excessively scathing filters. The only thing to recommend to this film is that it does not fear as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
