Bravo ace! You have just told the scary and incredibly intriguing story of a necrophilous cannibal in a sweet and fluffy drama. Obviously, a movie called Dahmer would be of two types: Horror or documentary, right? It was neither one nor the other. It was not close to detailed facts (in fact, he had almost no substance.) It was not really morbid or scary, nor even trying to be very disturbing. (As if you should have tried!) What the hell was thinking about this author / director ?? This is one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers and we have been raped on rooftops of abusive gay bars and long drone flashbacks on his former parent's house. I think Jacobson was really trying to present (or invent) "the sweet side" of j.Dahmer.
