Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. It usually gives solid performances, as in The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. It's also pretty good here, but the rest of the film suffers from a limited budget, poor writing and poor photography. The Miller-Movie formula gives him a 4. Richard gets a 5.
