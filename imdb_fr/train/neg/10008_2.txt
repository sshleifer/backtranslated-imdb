The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what a "walker" is or really care. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 70s. The subject was just not credible for 2007, even though it was in Washington. I think it sounded just right for everyone who watched it too, the applause was weak and fast at the end. Most did not stay for the Q & A either. <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrader really thought about the movie in advance. Many scenes seemed to be abbreviated, as if they were never finished or if they simply did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to guess what was going on. I really did not have the privacy or the boyfriend of Woody's (Carter). What were all the images of "male servitude" and "artistic" (Iraqi prison) torture? What was he thinking? I think it was his very bad attempt to try to create this dark subculture privacy for the Woody (Car) character. It did not work. It did not even seem to make much sense. <br /> <br /> Woody Harrelson was the only good thing about this movie. He played his character (car) flawlessly. You really had a good idea of ​​what a "walker" could be (say twenty years ago). He was great and will probably never be recognized for that. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Boring. <br /> <br /> I do not see it! It is painful! Unless you are a real Harrelson fan.
