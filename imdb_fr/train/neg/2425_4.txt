### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does this film propose? Out of control editing and cinematography that correspond to a terrible plot. It is sad to see Denzel Washington's talents get lost in such garbage. We certainly know that Mexicans can not save themselves, apart from the necessary, even militaristic, American forces. And we know that the father is a shady character, he is Mexican after all, unlike the woman who appreciates Creasey more because he is American. He killed them all thinking that she was dead. And did she do it? Of course, she will not do it, it's a young kid and you're not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of Hollywood fans. The compromise scene was the only thing that prevented me from classifying it below the "incredible success" (as some critics have pointed out) "Taken". The nausea of ​​such films will take time to go. It is in the ranking of such films that we must doubt the credulity of IMDb.7.7 for a film like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go understand! Mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
