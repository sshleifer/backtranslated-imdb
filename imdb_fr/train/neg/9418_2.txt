It is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and fame. It does not work at all. First, dramaturgy is completely wrong. It's very slow at first, then very quickly and unsatisfactorily. But there is also (and this may have to do with the cuts) a delicate movement between the genres. It begins as a thriller to be taken for cash, then degenerates into a joke rather than satire. the end may be funny, but it is also so direct that I almost felt that it insulted my intelligence (the little that there is). So the film tries to do everything but does not really succeed at all levels. You can also see that the development of the character is very unstable. It almost feels like Connery is playing three roles rather than one.
