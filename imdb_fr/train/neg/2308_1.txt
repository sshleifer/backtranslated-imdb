OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting. Then you insert that baby into the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. Supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit that I had a good laugh once about ten minutes before the end. This film contains the following elements: a battered and abused neighbor, a boring court case, a racisim, speeches about lynchings, death and arson. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you never listen to someone's criticism, do it here. You can not even force yourself to look at this shit. SHIT! I said it, CRAP! Whoever puts his name there should indeed sue.
