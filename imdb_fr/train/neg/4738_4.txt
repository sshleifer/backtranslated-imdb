I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of real action manga, captivating storyline, cool soundtrack, achievement (Kitamura Rocks!), Editing, not forgetting the beautiful Aya Ueto who perfectly fulfilled the role. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it, I felt like I won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi stopped, but are two completely different movies, much slower, the action is not as exciting and choreographed, and the development of the characters is undeveloped, apparently led by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO Monster franchise (If it's possible!) I agree with other critics who say it was a missed opportunity, if only Ryuhei Kitamura was pursuing this episode Few characters being killed quickly Even the real bad guys, get killed too easily without much fuss The brawl with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was just about everything ... y memorable fight scene Whera in Azumi 1, we had a e decisive fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the cap cam Azumi !! Azumi's attacks in the end were not convincing, but Aya is still doing a decent job. She looks great in the cloak ... but where does she come from? I do not think I will look at this one again and again! ...what a pity.
