Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are part of this class of actors that I'm always interested in seeing, despite the critics. I have always found that Ms. Ryan was a charming and seductive actress in almost every role, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" largely because of this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Meg Ryan does not play a nice character, she plays a shy whiner who starts to crush your nerves shortly after the opening credits and does not let go for several more days later. That said, the character of Kevin Kline is even more annoying and less sympathetic. So, even if you normally like these two actors, I recommend you to let this film go.
