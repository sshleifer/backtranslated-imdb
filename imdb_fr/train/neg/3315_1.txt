Bah. Another tired and disjointed editing of a non-copyright work that has never been designed to be filmed. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being a real actress, you see), and beautifully handled cuts through the passages between scenes. There are even some really amusing lines, and the film, the score and the editing are competent, apart from a strange dubbing error and conversation with the camera in view of the conclusion. <br /> <br /> But, oh, but. A large part of the distribution seems to be on autopilot and they are almost all very obviously too old (and in one case too young) for their declared age. Worse, they all speak "austinian", that singular self satisfied falsetto, sing a song that could not be further from the way people were talking about at the time of Austen (think Yosemite Sam, I do not ask you ). It's particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally witness the disappearance of the equally wacky "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his friends loved to laugh at me. <br /> <br /> And the worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She has never played more than one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, browsing through her entire range (smiles of sulking) for the first ten minutes, then repeats herself for the rest of the movie. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and her admirers, nor any apparent reason to interest them in her. <br /> <br /> In short, there is very little reason to look at Emma. It's a pretty nice adaptation, but if you want to pack a film full of anacronisms (that is to say, a seemingly thin mine that can not draw a bow or handle a period accent), you might as well do it right. very superior "Clueless".
