Attention: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, redoing this movie sui generis, is about as reasonable as remaking Psycho - oh yes, it's true, an idiot has already done that - I leave my case. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a chimpnaude bungling a simulation, which proves that it is not very smart from the start. Marky Mark appears in the photo without her underwear being visible, then is lowered by an ordinary woman who prefers the contact of chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> The staging photo of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, a-animated ship interior with genetic experiments on monkeys. Should we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimpanzee gets lost in this must-see 60s science fiction movie - the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the bewildering ineptitude of the space station's safety by stealing a pod without anyone noticing it, while demonstrating his abject stupidity to mount a rescue mission in deep space in a wormhole for a testable chimpanzee, with a million-dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen reserves. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say `useless remake ', Marky surfed the vortex, crashed into an alien planet, removed his helmet without thinking about the lethality of the atmosphere and is being pursued for a soundscape that almost looks like a lush rainforest, without the kliegs that illuminate the plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It's APES to hunt - or at least it would have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes thirty-three years ago. <br /> <br /> Since Marky Mark could not show his pecs, unbutton his pants or screw up his lame rap of whiteboy, he was without character. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth, inserted in an angular way, have helped enormously to establish * his * lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (also an irritating chimpanzee activist), lost without a Shakespearian text, was very successful in surpassing Marky and Clarke in Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the slave trader of the orangutans, played the role of relief of symbolic comics and klutz between species. Although I became bilious in hearing puns related to this film, a title of criticism captured the essence of this "new image of the planet of the monkeys": "The monkeys of Roth". While everyone was afraid to look like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as a chimpanzee Thade, chews on an impressive amount of scenery and throws kaka beautifully. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is crazy when we first meet him ... and he's about the same level as the one who's crazy about late movie. Nice twist. <br /> <br /> The original POTA (1968) featured a main character, Taylor, of Charlton Heston, who was so disillusioned with humanity that he left the earth for space without regret, but without knowing it as the film progressed, was stuck in a battle to prove the value of humanity - as their only champion! The original film was ultimately a story of humiliation, no salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT triumphed. Is there anything cerebral or ironic about Mark's Leo Mark? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there is a lot of running. <br /> <br /> Slogans shout: Take back the planet. But it's the planet of EPAS. In this film, humans and monkeys landed together, humans having degenerated into caves, allowing monkeys to acquire sensual body language and armor; monkeys MERIT to inherit the planet! Next is Marky Mark, in a real anthropocentric arrogance, assuming that humans MUST be the top predators, simply because they are there. "Take it back" is as ridiculous as the monkeys landing here in 2001, complaining: "A planet where men have evolved from APES ?? !! and then causing problems with their excessive and hairy anus. <br /> <br /> Heston was chosen in the 1968 POTA because he had earned his reputation as a maverick: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To portray him as a dumb and stubborn animal in an extraterrestrial society is to stun the expectations of the public: how crazy must a world be where our man Charlton can not impose respect? Marky Mark has for the moment only established that he has tight underwear. <br /> <br /> Although Heston was constantly denigrated by the Monkey Council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and prodigious action. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor for Mongoloid humans, it's as if this unpopular guy in school suddenly gets a classroom monitor, which asks you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and to throw him a shoe. Burton tries to elevate Marky to the icons of humanity, but he behaves like a perverse deviant. In the original film, the monkeys considered Taylor a deviant, but he was, for both the public and the apes, an icon of humanity. Once again this irony. <br /> <br /> It was normal that a man who raised the stage as an actor technique - Heston - plays the role of the father of Thaddeus Roth, the primo singer of the stage. As Roth's daddy-monkey, Charlton sets out his own immortal lines, turning against the HUMANS this time: Shit to all! '<br /> <br /> The film becomes stupid and stupid at the end. While Thaddeus gives Marky an unstoppable lesson, a pod goes down from there with Marky's chimpne inside. The monkeys demonstrate their stupidity by prostrating themselves before this unknown creature, while Marky proves his own daze by muttering, "Let's teach evolution to these monkeys." First, they are not monkeys, you monkey! Secondly, it is the genetic falsification and the making of fool plots that have brought great apes to this stage, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by eliminating them with the concealed laser gun is called "misanthropy, not evolution". <br /> <br /> Giving the twisted end would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren's half-nekkid role was actually part of the plot (always be my pants.). <br /> <br /> Even if it was the last underestimated hope of humanity; in the end, the cops take Marky to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard: "It's a crazy house! A MADHOUSE !! ... '
