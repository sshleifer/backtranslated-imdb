I see that many people liked this movie. For me, it was a movie right to write 101 and the person failed the class. From the moment Lindsey Price, the videographer, appeared to the end, the film was very predictable. I kept looking to see if it was going anywhere. <br /> <br /> We have the young widowed father first. Snapshots / TV # 1 always kill the mother or father if the child is a girl or a clutch of boys so that the single father can faint in front of his dead wife and seem completely out of his element by taking care of children. From My 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Dads. These films are usually dramas and comedies are television shows. <br /> <br /> Shot # 2 When a smart woman has a video camera in her hand, she plays an important role in the film. And will always have solutions or even if this person is an airhead <br /> <br /> Shot # 3 If the person in danger is a stranger, it must be of Latin American origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently, there are no legal Europeans or clandestine Europeans unless an element of the IRA is involved. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 4 Latino must be highly educated in his home country. In this case, it was a professed who earned 200 per month. And the highly educated Latino must now act as if he no longer has his head in his brain and let the aerial side take over. <br /> <br /> Shot # 5 The crime that the person committed was really not a crime but an accident. But because, in this case, he lost all sense when he crossed the border, he now behaves like a scathing idiot and is now putting his own daughter in danger by taking him on an unsuccessful quest at the border with the idiotic side. kick. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 6 We never run on a thug who flees a crime, but a poor little cute child. This is because the child's parents must play an important role in the film and the person who has accidentally killed the child may have a ridiculous interaction with the parents. <br /> <br /> Shot # 7 Give me a name. movie in which a cop is not the angry vet and they are paired with a rookie. Although they are homicide detectives, they must be the most experienced police officers. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order immediately come to mind. And the vet, though gruff on the outside, has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Shot # 8 Let's go get unemployed Soap Stars. Now, I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not get out of the paper bag and when she was on One Life to Live as Marty, he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It made me sick of the sea. It could be better grounded now, but it still can not work. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more insightful if it were not filled with clichés. I do not think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm not going to ruin the end. Oh damn I'm going to do it because I think it would be a bad service to humanity to let a person waste his time, she will never come back watching this movie. These are shots 6 and 7. Unless someone has ever seen a film before, you have to see what is coming. The father even makes a silly mistake at the end of the cops and gets shot by the angry veteran, who is suddenly very upset. You'd think she thought the poor guy was innocent all the way through the movie and shot him by mistake. When she did not do it. Now let's go to the little girl that the father took with him. Guess what's happening to him? After a while, she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father !! Come on! You all knew it was going to happen because it's a replacement child! That's why she did not go to live with Lindey Price. <br /> <br /> This film was an insult to me. Because there were so many tracks that this movie could explore and collapse, he chose to take the shot. The 2 stars are for 2 stars, the girl, who I think was very good and Lindsey Price who the character was boring but she did what she could with it. My advice is to take a vise and shake his head instead of watching this mess
