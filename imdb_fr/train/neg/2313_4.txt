Shintaro Katsu has gained a lot of fame by playing on the wonderful character Zatoichi. Zatoichi's films had a strange and unbelievable concept: a blind guy is Japan's greatest swordsman and spends every film to right wrongs and severely punish malefactors. He's a nice guy and the movies are exciting and addictive (I actually saw all the movies). That's why I saw this last part of the series Hanzo the Razor, because I imagined it would be very similar ... and I was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo's films are extremely sexual and also encourage the rape of "deserving women". You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period and he routinely detains evil women and interrogates them violently violating them with his "steel penis". It must be believed that he made his member so strong, but it is certainly not for the crazy. <br /> <br /> All in all, I simply can not recommend anyone to see these violent and misogynist films. However, looking at the other reviews, I can see they are still very popular ... and it's pretty scary. Despite some decent actor scenes and incredible fighting scenes, the movies look like brain pollution - and I would not want to imagine how the movies could have contributed to violence against women.
