I really liked this show, it was once. That is, until I realize all the faults it contains. It's so unrealistic. I know it's fiction, but it's not even the least bit. Here's why. ** The people who fly in front of us ... ** Are we really supposed to believe that a child like Yugi would come from a pharaoh of ancient Egypt? Let's go there! He is the biggest nerd on the face of the Earth. And what's new with the hair of Pharaoh (ak.a. Atem and / or Yami)? The last time I checked, the Pharaohs were shaved (with the exception of a small hair on the head) and wore sophisticated hats. <br /> <br /> And are we supposed to be convinced that a devilish and wealthy genius, named Seto Kaiba, can legally run a successful business while having the time to go to a poor little school like " Domino High "? Puh-leeze! First, he should be legally an adult to run a business. And that would not make him a boy genius, because he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why would he attend a school like "Domino High", when his company is successful enough to attend a sophisticated snob academy? Moreover, the side intrigues with his little brother are so shabby and lame. Every time you turn around, this kid has been kidnapped by bad guys for the bad guy. * Yawns * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor kid who lives with a rascal father. He says that Joey earns all the money he needs to go to school because his father is an alcoholic, but you never see Joey doing anything like work. He does not even mention work. And his sister Serenity is a complete fool. Why would she choose a snobby like Duke (who dressed his brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on TV) rather than a nice boy like Tristan? Is she really so helpless? Throughout the series, various characters are possessed by demonic forces, their souls are stolen by demonic forces and are plagued by mental illnesses. (Oh, it's safe for children, NOT.) Tea is the typical girl next door, whose sole purpose is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And although she has some interesting points, she just does not have time to shine as a main character. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply horrible. All the characters look sickly and anorexic. The perspectives are terrible (especially when they make close-ups of someone's hand) and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> <br /> But the worst hole in the plot of the series was the fact that Yami Millennium Puzzle can send souls back into their bodies. If so, how come he did not save Yugi's grandfather in the first place, when Pegasus stole his soul and spared himself the trouble of recovering it? <br /> <br /> All it is is a commercial for himself. Its only advantage is "Yu-Gi-Oh: the short series" of LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more valuable. Look at the abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
