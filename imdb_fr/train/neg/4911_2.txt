First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> I'll admit my mistake first: I did not realize it was a movie made for television. I was "thrown" by the "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes too much. Management and continuity were excellent. For the most part, the actors were exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The disadvantage of the film is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are scenes of violence, none of this violence should require an "R" rating. There is no nudity or free sex scenes. In fact, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (which is absolutely gorgeous), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all invited to the SG-1 series, but this film did nothing to advance their career since they were all used as actresses of second level. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as he usually does, and Mitch Pileggi reminded me of a modern day Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I learned to respect as an actor in the Millennium series, had no problem showing off her range of abilities. The biggest disappointment with the cast was Tracy Pollan. In addition to being an actress below average and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself cutting the television during his dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Lifetime TV programs. I would not recommend paying money to watch this movie. Considering that I have not found anything that can cause censorship, it is a film that deserves only to be watched on television, since nothing will be cut. As a TV movie, I would say it's a 5 out of 10. As a feature film with an "R" certification and a strong cast, I rate it as a 2 out of 10.
