THHE2 is fun in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say "oh sh * t!" and "move your face away from the fucking hole you're stupid ** s" or things like that, but I do not know if it's really worth seeing - I've been very upset all along horrible military characters who do not seem to know the first thing about the fight. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, more coolness and more body than the first one, but I'm still debating whether it cancels my feelings throughout the movie as it's ridiculous (and not a good laugh like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been better spent watching Aja's remake for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> Go and laugh, or go to gore, but do not hope to come out satisfied.
