I know it's a Power Ranger gimmick and it's for 7-year-olds, but why did they take it seriously with this movie? If they are going to write a plot with pencils, at least have the decency to make it ridiculous. It's a little hilarious if you look at it. We have a typical family full of clich√© characters (a veteran father who lost his wife and who blames LOLOL), children at the head of the air who strive to fill the stereotype but fail with horrible acts and a ridiculous sidekick who is useless. to the film, but to fill the camera space. It's funny! <br /> <br /> However, the real big moment is coming to an end when the father of the war and the evil actor try to fight with the sword, but they realize then that none of them knows how (probably because there is no room in the budget of the choreographers), so they propose this setting of American type Gladiator in which to run. LOL. <br /> <br /> Score 1/10 because they try to treat this seriously.
