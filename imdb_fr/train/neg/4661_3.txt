This film has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious film about the Second World War, which serves as a statement on racism. We have to look to understand that films reflect what we think about problems when they are produced and not the period they describe. Which means it's a 70s movie, not a 40s movie (WW2). Yet there are some good action scenes of 7 black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam. The story goes that the captain learned that these men are soldiers and not just service companies. There is a scene that could come from a film of the Civil War and not a film from the Second World War that reflects the film's content. The Black Lt. gives a German woman an innocent peck on the cheek and the white Capt gets angry. I enjoyed the film from the point of view of curiosity since the stars and the genre interested me.
