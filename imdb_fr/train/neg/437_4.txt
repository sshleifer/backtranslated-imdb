(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie, after hearing that he was smart and witty. I had to stop half-way because of the unbearable boredom I was feeling. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: to describe how the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experiment. What made me that I do not like the whole movie is two things. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was so realistic that one felt that in describing the problems a couple had to solve on a day-to-day day, it became ordinary and boring. <br /> <br /> Secondly, production has been neglected, with barely comprehensible dialogues. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
