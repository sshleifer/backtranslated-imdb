One question: why? First of all, the premise is not funny or engaging at all. They use recorded interviews and take the audio to animate it with animals that speak the roles. First, the interviews are not funny or entertaining at first, and even if they were, I'm sure they would be much more fun if they were originally seen without being turned into cartoons. How does that add hilarity to that? I opened the list of CBS sitcoms on Monday night (which has become a usual way to relax after stressful work days on Monday) and I found it. Of course, the programming of sitcoms would be rebroadcast anyway, summer, but reviewing these episodes would have been more entertaining. I tried to give a chance to "CC". I really did. When it all started, I thought it might be funny. Nope. And then it went on. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was a goal, if the interviews were broadcast in their entirety and if they had points. But no, it was just clips of a line, cut and pasted very quickly. It was like a horrible and awful version of Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken". I was not a fan of the now canceled sitcom of CBS "The Class". While it was running, it was half an hour of the line-up that I was fighting. But if I had to decide a whole season of this episode or three other episodes of "Creatures" ... let's just say that I would take the "Class". Considering it's been a few hours since it was aired and I'm here to see that I'm the first to comment ... I guess it's a good sign that no one has looked at it and it will not last much Longer. Cartoon cartoon.
