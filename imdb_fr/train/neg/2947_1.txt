There were very few films that I could not watch. I passed through Battle Field Earth without problem. But this is one of the worst movies ever to be made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to play in this film. I do not blame her. I would be ashamed to have this on a resume. I think this is a rare opportunity where almost every gag of a film falls flat on his face. Well, it's happening here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables that dangled in the back !!!!!! Halfway through the film, I was always looking for a piece of land. I never found one. Save yourself the trouble of praising this and save 90 minutes of your life.
