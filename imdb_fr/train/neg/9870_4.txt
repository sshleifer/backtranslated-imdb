I had several problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) The scenario - especially the voiceover of Kim Basinger: The films are not books; they should * show * the action rather than having a voice on * we * tell * what's going on. Sometimes I find a movie with a voiceover that works, but here it seemed more like a lazy way to write the script. In fact, it seemed to me if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voiceover. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel any emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas, but also Alex. Carter's role was pretty bad. This is a major failure for me in the definition of Jessie and Thomas characters - unrelated to them, it seemed to me that she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of sex. If this had been done correctly, the relationship that would unite them would have given much more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood Jessie's mid-life crisis. In the movie, it was more like boredom. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I did not think the movie was as painful as it was for me to turn off the TV. . . although that thought came to me.
