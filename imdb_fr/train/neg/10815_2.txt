I like the book "Jane Eyre" and I have seen many versions. All have their strengths and flaws. However, it was one of the worst I've seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and looked good, but she did not feel emotion. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester had seen in her. <br /> <br /> That brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had less emotion than Jane, if that was possible. How can two such tasteless people fall in love is a mystery, but that certainly did not catch my attention. The director (Zeffrelli) may have fallen asleep during the production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton's version (too good for Mr. Rochester!) is much more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect role of Mr. Rochester. in the 1997 A / E version (which is NOT exactly true to the book). <br /> <br /> Try to find something positive in this film: GÃ©raldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
