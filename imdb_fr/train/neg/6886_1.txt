John Heder was absolutely horrible in this movie. I had the impression of watching a bad student play for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was normal, not good, but not horrible (besides, she is cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace of this movie (although it was also bad judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> In total, I would like to avoid this at all costs. I'm just glad I did not pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will forever be in the role of "the dorky kid" unless he does serious work on his chops.
