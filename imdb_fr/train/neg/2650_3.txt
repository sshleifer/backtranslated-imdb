As I sat submissive to this TV mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton accept this junk? The film uses intrigues invented meaningless to deliver garbage to thousands of people. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The film was meaningless and any credibility was lost because of the excessive use of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton had tried to make this film a success, but in the end, she had to remember the old adage that you can not polish a shit. I hope you did not waste your New Year's time watching another stupid movie made for the TV movie. I now know why the networks started broadcasting series Sunday night, to get rid of garbage!
