The dream of a house master of art. Overestimated, overrated, overworked; A pretentious mix that not only did not deserve the best 1951 film was also overshadowed by the competition. Place in the sun, detective story, streetcar named DÃ©sir, Abbott and Costello meet the invisible man; you call it, if it came out in 1951, it's better than this arthouse crapola. The closing ballet is a treasure hunt for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the bad movie. Few actors in their time were less able (to act) and less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 worst of '51 (I saw 201 movies), and among the 5 worst winners of the Best Film Oscar.
