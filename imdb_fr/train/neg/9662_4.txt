I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what, I did not do it before watching TLB, and I must say that I was very surprised to see the above-average rating at IMDb. I found that there was a complete lack of history. You just dropped (and, unfortunately, not in the same way that the Saving Private Ryan made us into the movie), and the end is sudden, which was very unsatisfactory for me. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the wounded soldiers seemed to me quite realistic, especially considering the low budget. But get ready to laugh ... Some guys are thrown into the air after an explosion, as if they were Olympic gymnasts. An outdoor corkscrew or a somersault during WW I is a little too much for me, especially when it is played countless times during the film ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that m ' really made me laugh until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat. The German voices screaming and screaming ... incredibly funny. They seem to be spoken by one voice actor / performer, because they all sound exactly the same and look like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie. to anyone except people who just want to laugh a little because of their sad and old-fashioned quality.
