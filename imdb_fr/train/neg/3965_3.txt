I think I agree that a lot of the comments here have to be wrong. Even though the film is not necessarily bad, it is well below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions that haunt you. The film already begins with 2 slightly related stories that, even later, are not linked together. A couple loses their child who is cut off in bed. They move into a country house to flee their past and guess what ... the house is haunted, so to speak. From there, Dark Remains starts very slowly with scary moments (the first appearances of ghosts are nice and the sequence of the flashlight also worked very well). OK, so ... The woman sees the ghost of her daughter, other ghosts of people who died in accidents or suicides, a man tries to solve the problem of the secret of houses, a woman is depressed, strange neighbors appear . That's about all that was happening, but the idea that it's their own emotions is nice, so wait for the turn. There is no twist, you are just confused by a haunted story, the story of the haunted house, the strange neighbor, a frightening prison totally useless and the dead girl thrown with a photo-idea reminding me a lot " The blind". The end is ridiculous because when you start and finish a movie, this slow and lame movie is lame enough to include masses of ghosts at a time that look like a zombie, of course to return to a piano music and a beat slow. <br /> <br /> To make short ... Dark Remains could have been a nice story of scary ghosts if the script did not try to go anywhere and did not get anywhere. Too many stories gathered that make sense and contradict the basic atmosphere of the film. And next to ... please, never use abandoned prisons again. It is so used and in this case it does not even make sense. "Hey, there's this scary prison up, let's shoot there." I guess a lot of ingredients in Dark Remains have been added to this composition.
