It's a really horrible film. The plot (as it is) is totally indecipherable. (I think it has something to do with blackmail, but I'm not quite sure.) <br /> <br /> Half of the dialogue is useless clich√©s. The other half is spoken by the different actors in such unintelligible imitations of "southern" accents that (thankfully) the words can not be recognized. <br /> <br /> But the only real tragedy in the film is that such historical talent as Mary Tyler Moore was apparently in a financial or personal situation so serious that it was there. <br /> <br />
