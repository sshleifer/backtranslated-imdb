Too many incidents of violence. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one scene to another and in almost every violence burst. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to suffer an electric shock and I miss a film without a fight. But, please, not one after the other. My reaction was neither a shock nor a horror, it was: "Here we are again." There is a semblance of history between scenes of violence, but two-thirds of the film, I had completely extinguished and I could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If that is the case better than filmmakers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable lives, like making shoes or delivering mail.
