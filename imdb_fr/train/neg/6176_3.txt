I'm not a big fan of the Stooges slapstick, but I find their story interesting. I recently tried to look at stuff from every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see a Joe shorts does not seem to be easy; It's the only one I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say that the quality problems of the Joe brand shorts are really not Joe's fault, and I guess that's the case. Joe as an interpreter is far from the worst thing about it. The thing that bothers me the most about this was emphasized in another comment: the fact that the other guys sting themselves against the third violates the entire philosophy of the comedy team / Stooges. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived by those in charge as unsuitable - although there were no real off-camera conflicts between him and the others - and that was their way of working at this subject. <br /> <br /> And what about the titles of the latter and some other courts of Stooges? Certainly a lack of creativity passes there; was this kind of thing the cause or the effect of drying out the shorts market?
