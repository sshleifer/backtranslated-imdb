When theater employees find an old reel of film, they decide to show it during the midnight projection of Night of the Living Dead, assuming it is an old reel of first. Unfortunately, it's actually an old experience of controlling the Nazi spirit that turns the audience into a horde of unscrupulous zombies. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the hate of this movie. It's a small budget independent production with a lot of camp, but it does not deserve a "1.1" here on IMDb. It's so much fun. It is obvious that filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies and they have created an entertaining tribute with references and tributes. It sounds like Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, and others. , although really hypnotized by thinking they are zombies, they may have the physical attributes of the unbelievable undead, but I appreciate the efforts of the authors to explain it. The gore effects were reasonable for the budget, the acting was perfect and the story was fun. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
