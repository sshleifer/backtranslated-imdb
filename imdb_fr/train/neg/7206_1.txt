Well. Where to start Let's just say this; avoid this movie at all costs <br /> <br />. It's based on a series of cartoons. The film gives the look of the cartoon <br /> <br /> to the image of Hamlet. Filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be <br /> <br /> here, an ugly camera work, a terrible music and a sufficient number of products for you <br /> <br /> make you want to never visit Yahoo! once again, this movie is really the <br /> <br /> bottom of the cannon. To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett make their way through this photo with the gay abandon <br /> <br /> of men who spotted a distant kind of paycheck. "<br /> <br /> They should pay us some of the millions they have earned by watching it. <br /> <br /> Awful.
