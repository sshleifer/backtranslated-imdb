I thought this movie was a disappointment. I expected him to be much better than he was. I'm so glad I did not pay to see this movie and not sit in a movie theater for this one. Where to start on this movie, the game in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and the screenplay of this movie was nothing special. I thought this movie was supposed to be great, but it was not more than a waste of time. I think the role in this movie was terrible, none of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think if we had maybe had another actor playing Kirk than Jay Baruchel, it might have been better, but all the time I watched that movie, it looked high and I did not not the impression that he was not playing in this movie. Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. Not all actors in this film had a name and had very little effect on this film. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were some liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth telling your friends they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had trouble with that because he could not decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. Honestly, I think he has to stick to the Burger King ads. I think this film could have been better if the writers had gone to see another director. The scenario of this movie is like all the other sexy girls OK, a love story - boring, I think it would have been better if he had more originality, but what a disappointment. Honestly, I would not recommend anyone to see this movie. I think you would have more fun at the dentist than in this movie. So save your agony and do not see it.
