I just finished "Dark Chamber", "Under Surveillance" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not by the film, but by some of the rave reviews I read, which influenced my eyes. The story was so devastated by intrigues and the majority of such flat actors, categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and giggling while I lived in this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin leaves the home of her house with a mother who is dependent on the treatment of pain to go live with her father, the cop, despite that of his mother warnings that daddy is not good. When a young woman is found murdered, Justin is wary of the tenants who live in the adjacent apartments. With the help of a couple of friends, he installs hidden cameras to keep an eye on these people. As the truth begins to fall apart, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> A good thing is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have generously slapped an extra star or two here if it had peeled off a bit, but no luck. It would have been the potential saving grace of the film. Eric Conley played Justin very well, I thought, and I would not be surprised to see him anymore in the future. <br /> <br /> The general principle of the film, although sown with clich√©s, could have worked if there had not been the ridiculously hollow "representations" of the key players in the distribution, notably Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father). The horror! (excuse me the pun) <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget movies. Indeed, I think the independent film is our only hope of making a decent film in the coming days. I'm going to give a bit of leeway to low-budget films in terms of special effects, lighting, even sheet music, and the overall quality of the image. However, I do not give any allowance for the stick figure game and the scenario of a Swiss cheese lover. There are a large number of low-budget films made with skill. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not help but think that at least some of the critics who have touted "Dark Room" are somehow related to its production.
