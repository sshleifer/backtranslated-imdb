I would not be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say it could be a good show..This show is only good if you do not know what "talent" is .. I will not even say how much Offensive is (I know it can be offensive to a lot of people) because it's not really what bothers me in the series. stupid and I'm afraid it will one day be led by people who look at this garbage .. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is simple, it is about an offended woman , egocentric and misguided (Sarah Silvermen) passing through everyday life .. <br /> <br /> That's it ... As if it had not been done a million times..In fact, almost every joke was made or is racist .. <br /> <br /> Sarah also loves to sing..I love her voice.it's..not the lyrics. The lyrics are awful..that she likes to sing about a lot of things .. <br /> <br /> If you like to see a hot woman belittle everyone and they feel like shit while leaving and saying shit about each race so this show is for you
