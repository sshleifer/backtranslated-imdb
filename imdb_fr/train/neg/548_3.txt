I saw the rating of 7.5 IMDb on this movie and based on that, I decided to watch this movie that my roommate rented. She said she had already seen him. "It's funny and sad, I cried the first time I saw her," she says. Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies, it deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I've seen in my life, it does not deserve more than a 3. Any movie where I can guess perpetually what will happen next is not good for me. The characters are incredible, the act is not realistic and their motivations are artificial. It's dramatic and the songs are not all great. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exaggerated and therefore not at all realistic. Any emotion or link between the least subtle characters must be magnified by a useless song. I think I understood that the relationship between father and son was more like a relationship between friends than a relationship between a parent and a child, without having to go through a five-minute song. Stupid comic relief with a laughter track was neither funny nor necessary (as we understand it, Laxman is not the most powerful tool in the hangar). If a film tries to bring tears to the most insidious means, it just does not make sense, but a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Generally, if someone is suffering from end stage lung cancer, their son who lives with them know that something is wrong without the need to know it. Too many holes to count to count. At first, the movie was fun and cute in the same way that Bollywood movies are meant for people who do not look so avidly, but it has become boring. Making a fun and heartbreaking movie requires a lot of talent and the best way to do it is usually not to have all the fun elements in the first half of the movie and all the heartbreaking elements in the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Maybe there was a little more depth than the other Bollywood movies I saw, but not much at all. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the film than games supposed to be fun. I did not shed a single tear and I did not want it, I was rather overwhelmed by a feeling of disgust at the attempt of a dramatic end. I do not recommend this movie if you want to watch something good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is a little sad.
