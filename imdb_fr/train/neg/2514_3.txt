I liked Dewaere in the black series. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers", also called "Going Places". Ok, it's a couple of guys displaying the convention in the most absurd and irreplaceable way; many people find such behavior amusing. It was a boring and useless exercise designed to shock. I find the smile on Blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoying. Black Series was a valid expression of personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the first moment we see Patric Dewaere preaching in the abandoned lot, we have an idea of ​​the magnificent anti-hero with whom we will be spending time in the next few hours. When we see him chasing down the unhappy middle-aged woman with her friend Depardieu in "Going Places", we are quite aware that two hours spent with these guys will drain the soul. I have trouble even getting a "3" for this annoying distraction.
