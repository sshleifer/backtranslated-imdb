There are three films with this style of animation that I fondly remember from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "The Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit". I have copies of "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and I have not seen "The Last Unicorn" for more than ten years. It was until today and I would like now not to have done it. What bothered me the most is the script. It was incredibly hectic and often foolish. Things would happen without reason and others would happen without explanation. We do not just talk about little things here either; we are talking about key points of the plot! The story itself is not very good at first, but it could have worked if the scenario had been decent. Not even close. On top of that, the music was awful! I know that music in movies like these rarely has what might be called classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to lose consciousness with a bowling ball. It was one of those movies that I was going to show my kids someday, but it was just cut. I do not think I could ever attend this shit party. Disappointed, it's a euphemism.
