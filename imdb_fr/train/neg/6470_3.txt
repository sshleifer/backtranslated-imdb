Disney goes to the well too often, because anyone who has ever seen the small original MERMAID will feel downright ripped off. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to present it to King Triton. The celebration is quickly organized by Ursula's sister, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to obtain the king's trident. In stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean while Melody grows wondering why she can not enter. <br /> <br /> This is what is terrible and terrible, which describes this sequel directly to the video. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the impression that everything you watch seems to come directly from other Disney movies. I guess Disney can only plagiarize! Do not tell me that the penguin and the walrus do not remind you of another duet of King LION! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include revenge between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chief. They have terribly underplayed! The climax between Morgana and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly narrow and too difficult to handle. A bit embarrassing for Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better to rent and make it laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the other suites in which Disney will drown you.
