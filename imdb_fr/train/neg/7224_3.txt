The film stays in the gray too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, resulting in a large number of strange sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of the way of telling stories, they just become weird and incomprehensible. It forces you to look at the film again, but I will not do it. It's because I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure if I watched it in the evening, I would fall asleep. For me, the movie was like the "Blade Runner" of a poor man. <br /> <br /> The film leaves too many questions and improbabilities. The film leaves a useless and unsustainable impression. <br /> <br /> The strange look of the movie does not help much. The film is halved in computer graphics / halves real life, but it has not been divided into two as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as would be the case for example in more recent films such as "Sin City" and "300". They even created half of the characters in the movie by computer, which seemed like a very useless and strange choice, considering also that the animation of the character was not too impressive. Of course, the futuristic environment is always beautiful and the film is obviously not cheap to do, but its style is more important and, in this case, it's really not a positive thing to say. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely horrible and uninteresting. The main god of the film constantly says lines such as; "I'm going to do it, but you do not want me to want to do it." So do not say anything, Mr. Horus! It's irritating and very easy to put into a movie, if you do not want to explain anything about the plot. The deeper questions and meanings of the film become entangled in the film and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors have always done their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were convinced that what they were doing would be something special. I can not say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and the film are far from original. It scams many classic and semi-classical science fiction movies, mostly modern. Maybe that's also why the movie made me feel very redundant. <br /> <br /> A failed and uninteresting movie experience. <br /> <br /> 3/10
