This film is a hindrance to the making of a film. I can not believe it was even classified as a comedy - not funny. Not only was the scenario atrocious, but the actors should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond ... 99% of the rest of the cast ... ouch. Just about everyone ... wow, it's hard to even ... wow. Here is the number one rule on the comedy "DO NOT TRY TO BE FUNNY". There are many very talented actors in Canada who can do theater and comedy - none of them have been used in this film. Canadian casting and nepotism directors continue to perpetuate bad filmmaking in Canada. I realize that it's technically an "American" movie, but look at the director, the actors, the place, etc. I just saw this on Bravo - they should be ashamed to have bought the rights to show this movie. Again, there are a lot of great films that can not have airtime and they show that shit.
