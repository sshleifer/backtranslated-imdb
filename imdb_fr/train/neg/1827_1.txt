Envy features some of the best. Black Jack, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, we can only hope for the best. However, with "Envy", no one could save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are the best friends and coworkers of a sandpaper plant. Both earn a good living, but as Tim has a better performance at work, he can afford more than his mate Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always proposes new ideas of invention. One day, Nick had the idea of ​​a spray can to remove the poop of a dog (yes, I'm serious). Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to invent this product. He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profits equally. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, entitled "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious), ends up making millions. He likes to spend his money on things like a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer and refined deserts. Tim starts to feel like Nick wants to. Hence the name of the film. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it is still horrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogues and bad performances of all actors. As I said earlier, none of them could save this mess. Even the great Christoper Walken, playing the role of a homeless character named "J-man", did not make this movie funny. The film is bad from the beginning and is only getting worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film if: * you like shit (no pun) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tuxedo <br /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie to any price, but avoid especially if: * you are offended by the humor of the bathroom * you like animals
