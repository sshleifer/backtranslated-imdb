Probably encouraged by admirers of his much better "Orlando," Potter comes here as a vehicle in the worst case: she writes, directs, stars, and co-writes the music, including a mawkish love song. The film is very similar to a high school or high school project of a teenager convinced that his own intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to her as to her. But Potter's character is as unfriendly as the object of his romantic obsession is inimitable, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of tango. Maybe if she had not started herself, it might have worked. She simply can not play, either herself or not. Pretentious, too ambitious, dull and stupid.
