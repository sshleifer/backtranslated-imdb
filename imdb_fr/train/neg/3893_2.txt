I thought that the main character, the astronaut with the bad case of races (in his case, his skin, his hair, his muscles, etc.) could always have more film after being reduced to a puddle. All he has to do is get a job as a Blob. The principle of this film is rather nil. An astronaut is exposed to sunspot radiation (I think) and thus begins to behave like an ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only is it a puzzle, but it must apparently kill humans and consume their flesh in order to maintain a kind of cellular integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that every time a radiation accident or any experiment occurs, the person instantly turns into a killing machine? Why is it? <br /> <br /> The astronaut leaves the "secret facility" (which has no security) in the night, losing a part of himself as and when he moves. Apparently, he just keeps enough memory to push him to the launch pad, perhaps because he wanted to go back into space. <br /> <br /> That's the beginning of the part of the film that is rather full, with a doctor who walks with a Geiger counter, trying to find the man melting by the buzz he emerges. He kills a stupid fisherman resembling Bill Gates, scares a little girl like Frankenstein's monster film, and ends a wackier couple (punishing them karmically for stealing lemons). Then there is a short scene where he strikes his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young goosebumps and pursues his girlfriend. You would think that after cutting off his arm and running away, the scene would change. But no ... we got about ten minutes of the woman huddled in a corner, gasping and screaming in terror, even if the monster had disappeared. All I could think of was ... the director's girlfriend, anyone? <br /> <br /> The end of the film is even darker than the rest. The melting man eventually turns into a pile of modeling clay, then ... nothing. That's all. This is the end of the movie. Well, at least that meant there was no room for a suite.
