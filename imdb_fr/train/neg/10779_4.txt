I found this film very disappointing. The talents available to the director - including Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (not to mention the four main actors) - were completely lost for a mediocre and mediocre story, whose conclusion could not really be worry once. introduced to the terrible stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just boring (seeming to resume her role of high fidelity, without humor), Crystal just plays her old hyper-active, neurotic, boring old man and Cusack is simply walking around in his seemingly bored role. the entire project. <br /> <br /> For what is supposed to be a "romantic comedy", there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for comedy (possible SPOILERS) well, the only moments of light humor came from the role played by Cusack in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - the screenwriter obviously could not show any originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was quite amusing, as the Mexican lover and Walken had a rather amusing ride as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-Dogme-type director, but these games made up very little time in front of the screen . to sniff his groin by a dog. A pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a big fan of the majority of John Cusack's works, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely disappointed by a movie full of good ideas, and at the same time, completely reluctant to explore or develop each of them, he has instead resorted to the same old clich√© of the genre and sometimes even lowering himself to the depths of the almost disgusting humor of the film for teenagers. <br /> <br /> A very poor 4/10.
