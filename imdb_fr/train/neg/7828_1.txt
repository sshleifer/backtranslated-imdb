With 2 days in the valley, I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just another long line of Tarantino scams that have appeared since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the film is amusing for the first five minutes, but the filmmakers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing useless and grotesque violence to the hip quotient. You better skip this one.
