Anyone who has watched a few movies from the Lifetime Movie Network knows that the credibility of the plot is the first thing to avoid from the planning board. So when the crazy Lara moved into Patti's house and methodically starts driving her house lady, she did not even blink. When Lara finally intensified her activities by threatening poor Patti and challenging her to do anything, I just nodded. You see, on the LMN planet, people do not behave as they do for a particular reason, they just do it for the action to continue. Only on the planet LMN, the owner of a house could almost be thrown out of his house because of his power of seduction! Poor Patti - she had too much self-confidence, and Lara withdrew her medicine, then there was this big fight up the stairs with a syringe full of deadly substance that ends up being injected into someone's stomach and a mortuary bag coming out the front door. The horror! <br /> <br /> But take it to me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You have to watch it once, just for the big bursts of laughter you will have. On the scale of improbability, I give this film a score of 95/100. Make a big batch of popcorn and get sliced ​​apple. You will understand later.
