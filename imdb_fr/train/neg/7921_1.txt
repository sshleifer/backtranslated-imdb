The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to that of the original Corpse Grinders. What's left is different from the other movie consists of strange extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> I think this movie would be the # 1 worst movie on IMDb - if someone had actually watched it. The plot is disconnected and, in many (far too many) instances, makes absolutely no sense. The real wonder here is why in the world this sequel was created for such an unsuccessful and horrible film (but still a bit better). <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie if you like watching terrible movies for a good laugh.
