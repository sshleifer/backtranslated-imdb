Oh dear. good casting, but writing and directing is an art and writing with mind and spirit is a bit of a task. Even doing a good comedy, you have to have the right timing and the right time. I do not tell everything, there were places where I laughed hard but it was very few times. I mainly focused on the fluid and quick dialogue that made some people in the movie annoying. It may sound great when you read the script in your head, but transmitting it to the camera is a different task. And the work of the portable camera gives energy to some parts of the film. The general direction was good but the scenario did not suit me at all, but I'm sure you read the scenario in your head, it would sound good. Sorry.
