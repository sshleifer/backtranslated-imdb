First, I will not tell you WHY I have rented this movie, because I'm still puzzled ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage looks a lot like any movie I've seen where a plane is hijacked. There is of course this important person on the plane, and the hijacker in search of revenge. Sadly, some of the methods of stopping hijackers have already been used in other films. Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly? <br /> <br /> Although it is glorified Ice-T on the cover, the film features the incredible Kim Oja as the air host "surprised" by the five pirates from the air, which naturally comes back to haunt them. For the rest of the cast, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania of "Seinfeld". <br /> <br /> I can not forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used a pound of PLASTIC to blow a door lock ... BRILLANT . <br /> <br /> The plot was abnormally predictable. <br /> <br /> The script - atrocious. I got to the point where I could say something that, in my opinion, would make a stupid comment, and that would be the next line of the movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding special effects ... the only special thing about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the movie DID took place in the air. But because of less than stellar performances, the only Rage in the movie was the spectator. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to pick a movie, just because it's bad. Please save yourself, do not choose that.
