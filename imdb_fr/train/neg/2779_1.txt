Obviously, when you give an actor enough money, he will not do anything. I do not know how much John Rys-Daves has had, but most of the money he earned should be paid to his fans as an excuse for being associated with such a film ROTTEN. The special effects were worse than those of the B-movies of the 50s and the other actors' game was even worse. As to whether the acting game was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. English was terribly accentuated and I do not think anyone could really speak English, they just memorized the way the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both "real" and real .
