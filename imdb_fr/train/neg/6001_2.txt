It may seem crazy even to people who remember this series ... But I remembered that as real action. I do not think I have seen the drawing before. but the film? may be. I remember it very well. The guy was in a building a bit like a showroom. He even had the red jacket. It was pitch dark and it became a red car and there was this guy on the second floor watching him. The car / guy turned around and crashed through the large window-type showroom and then into the street. And then proceed from. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else remembers it too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope not.
