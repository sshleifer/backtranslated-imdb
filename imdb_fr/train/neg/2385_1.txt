I watched this film because I am a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd try their sister, Rain Phoenix. I regret to check it. It was awkward and the movie just has that weird plot if that's what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean is sitting on a toilet that's both sleeping with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I have never been so dissatisfied with my life. It was just garbage. I can not believe that the actors agreed to make such a waste of film, money, time and space. Sissy being "beautiful" did not get me. I thought she was anything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHAT'S THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame that the poll does not include 0, do not even deserve a 1. Hope that Rain is better in other films, I forgive him for this performance, I mean I would not do much better with this film.
