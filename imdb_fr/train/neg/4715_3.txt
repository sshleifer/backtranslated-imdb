I recently watched Johnny Test in the hope of finding humor. I failed, horribly. Cartoon Network generally tends to make their shows enjoyable for all audiences, but Johnny Test is an "entertainment" in its lowest form. Writing is incredibly predictable, and gags that run are not at all. Kids will love, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Now, that does not mean that everything is bad. The starting theme was rather catchy, but for some reason, they took the skeleton and figuratively crushed it with a figurative aluminum bat. It's a shame, because it was really one of the best things. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters could be very interesting, in theory. With a little work, the characters could work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. Again, it makes it easier for children. <br /> <br /> The pace is also a bit too fast. The episodes are too busy, leaving little time for intelligent writing. It's a shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that show shows. On the other hand, the fast pace will prevent children from losing any interest, which is actually the entire target audience. to be funny or interesting. It's a show I want to love, but I can not. There is so much potential that is not realized. The kids will enjoy it, but that's about it.
