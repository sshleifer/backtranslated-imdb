I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach film I saw, "Burning Moon". But while this film was rather dark and nasty, "Premutos" seems to play it mostly for laughs. While the way Ittenbach made this film with no money in his free time is admirable (and the DVD documentary is worth it), I always fought not to move quickly to the next gore scene. Of course, it's gore, and if that's all you want, then go for it and enjoy it. But be warned: there is an inordinate amount of lame comedies and boring shows. Many compare this to Peter Jackson's films, especially "Braindead". But looking at what Jackson did with a similar budget in "Bad Taste", it's clear that Ittenbach lacks a talent: talent. 3/10 (for gore effects quite good and plentiful and to make the most of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
