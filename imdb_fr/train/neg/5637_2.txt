I understand that I want to make a nervous and different film. I understand the previous comments that it is a misunderstood movie. As soon as the film came to an end, my first comment was: "That's what happens when a rich princess wants to become a movie star and has no talent" ..... she uses the money from her father to make a movie that she wrote, directs, and pays for ..... obviously close the film to realize that there was no character development nor orientation as a beginning, a middle and an end ..... the voyeur part was good and edgy but what's the point? I saw a woman go to a house, find pictures, kiss the guard, go out on a very cold night (impossible to believe) to check the noise and run on his love of the guardian .... the film ends ..... Someone educates my ignorant arss ?? I really want to know what the problem is ... what was the vision of the directors ... why no development of the dead lover? Why no background on the guardian? What is the point of night vision? What is the point of lipstick on the car? Why a dead guard? Why tell us about a mentally ill / voyeur? What is the urn? Oh, and is the lamp supposed to mean which house it is? Territorial? Why? Why would the guardian feel like home? this aspect has never been pursued ...... As for William Defoe ... I rented this movie because it was in and known for its angry characters ..... writing to me and telling me what I had to learn .. .. I am only a mother of Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
