The past epitomizes a drug addict in rehabilitation when he returns to his sick brother and a former girlfriend after what he hoped would be his last stay in rehab. "The dramas of life", presented here in the most simplistic way that one can imagine (even writing has nothing to envy in mind). The troupe is composed of attractive actors who smile sadly, and music and photographs are gloomy (some visual effects are laughable, touches of indie-clich√© who feel a minimal budget). Although it was written and performed by a man, it was produced by a woman. I'm not sure, but I think it's perhaps a distinct reason why this image of two men, separate brothers who come closer, never gels, never feels lived. It is an attempt to enter into a male relationship, but the cautious and sterile presentation is a cheater. There is no heart in that which lives, breathes or bleeds in this material. "The Perfect Son" is quickly broadcast by too many cooks in the kitchen.
