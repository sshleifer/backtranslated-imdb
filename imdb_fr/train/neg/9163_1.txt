Leap years are stars of the local and regional film and television scene. And yet, they can not record this movie. There are so many things that go against this: no more acting, too melodramatic, bad scenario, incoherent direction; and too little goes for that - decent music, good cinematography. This comment is aimed primarily at people who throw all local films in the same basket after watching this movie and claim that all local films are bad. Please do not judge the rest based on this movie. This is a television soap opera posing as a romantic feature film. I had high hopes when I bought my ticket and my hopes were disappointed five minutes after the beginning of the film.
