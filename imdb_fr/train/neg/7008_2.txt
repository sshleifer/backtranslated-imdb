Annie Potts is the only asset of this really dull movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really upset that someone stole the Corvette and his classmates became a hotrod (probably the ugliest car in a movie), and leaves for Las Vegas with Annie devilish genius who stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would have torn out my eyes after seeing this if it was not for the pleasure of watching Annie Potts very early, and it's too bad for Hamill not to have shot a few acting lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a clumsy cameo.
