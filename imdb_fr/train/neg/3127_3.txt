An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally falls on a 10-meter old mummy, well preserved in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this secret and to call on a Jewish translator to help him understand his story. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of the many giants that apparently existed at the time. In order to save his son from a devastating flood that would kill everything, he mummified his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to wake him years later. In our present, fallen angels always roam the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual should take place. Most of the film is slow, with lots of Bible bullshit and some lousy and very difficult fights. The mother looks decent but she is not shown often enough. It should have had more to do with it but it dragged a lot so ... eh. Do not bother yourself.
