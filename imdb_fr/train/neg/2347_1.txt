First, let me tell you that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; That's why I was curious to see this, his first role. No argument that his talent is apparent and his performance excellent. I guess I can also see how professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that the movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie failed. <br /> <br /> Halfway through, I thought, "How long does it take to look at a shop girl, standing around a deserted gift shop, rearranging the goods?" seemed to last forever! <br /> <br /> Then, I thought, maybe it's one of those movies where the director tries to relax the audience before hitting it with a dynamic event. No chance. The film continues, it's a tasteless story, boring and uneventful until the end. <br /> <br /> I do not say that because I am an action junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add to that the fact that the quality of cinematography and sound are comparable to your neighbor's bad movies. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I do not understand how anyone could like this movie. Zero entertainment value. The longest of the 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
