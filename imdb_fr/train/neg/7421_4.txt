Watching beautiful women stroll, play cops and burglars is one of the most charming guilty pleasures that the average film allows me to enjoy. So, The House on Carroll Street was not a waste of time, although the story is artificial and the story is uninspired and somewhat irritating. There are many references to different Hitchcock images, including Kelly's choice. McGill is in the lead role. She is disguised as Grace Kelly and she is not far from the goal. Not at all. But his character is not convincing. In the way she is presented to the public, she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined period, real events and a specific problem. But the story escalates in the first minutes into a crime story with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable as the performances of the actors are good, as is the photography and scenography. <br /> <br /> The finale at Central Station, New York, is breathtaking. It starts in the underground section, then goes up on the roof. We can rent the film for its good use of architecture.
