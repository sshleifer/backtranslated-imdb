This film begins with the execution of a sorceress practitioner and his mistress. His head is cut off and buried separately from his body ... it sounds like "The thing that would not die" is not it? Well, it happens a bit like that, but once the body is in the head, all the interesting and horrible deaths are over and the film is moving very slowly. I mean, the movie only lasts 88 minutes and I kept thinking, "When will it end?" The characters in the movie are mostly idiots and deserve enough to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very mean, because he moves slowly and you really wonder how he manages to do anything, knowing that he is afraid of jewels. The only thing that prevents you from looking after the attachment of the head is the fact that there are so many flashing breasts that you really start losing the thread. I still want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn movie. As a horror movie, this is a way to slow down the movements, with a lot of slow steps to be even more enjoyable. And do not read the back of the box, because it is clear that there were zombies devouring flesh that attacked the city. There is not ... a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled that they are not at all a factor in the film and their scene is rather useless. So, for the most part, I say you should avoid this movie unless you find it too cheap.
