My nose is slightly bent as I write this. I had already sent a comment on this film a few weeks ago, which has not yet appeared. I suppose he was rejected, even though he follows all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first time. thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who has played in major productions such as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also very good. Unfortunately, everything ends up sinking under the weight of a really awful melodramatic scenario. There is also an abundance of free nudity that does nothing to advance the story or even gives an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed work of art. <br /> <br /> A day trip to Valencia Beach is much less painful than having to find these fictional characters anywhere, anytime.
