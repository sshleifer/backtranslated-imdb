I found "The Arab Conspiracy" in a basket of bargains and thought I had discovered a lost treasure. Dear friends, there is a reason why you do not hear much about this film. The plot is muddy, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is about as hot as the cold, ordinary tofu, and the end leaves you flat. Even Sean Connery can not save this one.
