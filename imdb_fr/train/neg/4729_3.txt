LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of the strangest movies of Elvis. At once gooey, semi-soft, surreal and strange Elvis meets a very offbeat girl with an annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense as it does with most of Elvis Presley's movies, and there are a lot of strange characters galore. Not a lot of music in this one, but what I liked, even if none is memorable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey enter his beach house at night, but a few minutes later, a delivery man arrives and it is day !! What?? It's about the essence of the film. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis is superb and B) the dog steals the show.
