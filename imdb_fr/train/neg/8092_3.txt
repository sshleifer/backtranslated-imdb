Tom Wolfe's sumptuous satirical novel about life in New York's snobbishness has a lustrous look, but it is not well served. The film does not just suffer from everyone's misinterpretation, Tom Hanks as a carefree Yuppie, Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as a handsome Southern manipulator and Bruce Willis (?) As a darling of New scholars. York. The most serious mistake was in the director's chair. Robert Altman may have breathed life into these unimaginable characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, in spite of all his visual sophistication, never paid attention to the nuances of the human experience. The resulting film looks good, but seems to go against its subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire does not make the viewer angry, what is it for?
