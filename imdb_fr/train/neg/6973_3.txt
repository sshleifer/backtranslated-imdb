I did not even know that this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy, hidden in the bottom of my dusty horror cabinet. The title on the box said "Insect" and the illustrations on the back clearly indicated that it was only another insignificant and poorly produced horror film. Of course, they can be fun as long as you do not expect a clever scenario and you are not irritated to see a gigantic amount of cheese makeup effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy of viewing is below the standards here in "Blue Monkey"! The plot is ridiculous and very unoriginal, the performances of actors are painful to observe and there is a total lack of suspense. Following the ever popular trend of "big insect" movies, "Blue Monkey" is about a new and unknown insect species that is wiping out doctors and patients in a distant hospital. Manufacturers could not be more evasive about the real origin of this oversized gigantic creature! All we know is that it is not outer space and has been extracted from a tropical plant. Other than that, there is absolutely no explanation for the origin of this new type of insect! As I said, do not expect a smart scenario. The first half of the film is quite funny, with a little gore and the introduction of a couple of disturbed characters (a blind lady and alcoholic aged 80!), But the second half terribly boring. It is also towards the end that "Blue Monkey" begins to excessively scam older (and better) movies. Near the climax, they apparently also ran out of budget, because the lighting becomes very bad and the type in monster costume is not very well camouflaged. "Blue Monkey" is worth a look if you're really bored or really want to see all the 80s horror movies ever made. Fans of B-cinema could recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns of Outer Space", "Curtains") in the insignificant role of Roger, head of the clinic.
