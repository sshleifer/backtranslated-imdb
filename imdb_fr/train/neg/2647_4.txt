I will say one thing for Jeanette and Nelson - even in such a musical without gaiety, without intelligence and painfully inept, there is always that twinkle in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is present even when the material is very fine. Even when the score is practically disposable, it does not exist according to some catchy melodies. And even when the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Actually, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own husband, Gene Raymond, in SMILIN 'THROUGH, which, nevertheless, was a considerably better movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but it's the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarassing in her "hep" issue with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only glare at the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what it was. as on Broadway in 1938. It must surely have more wit and style than is evident in this low production of MGM. Edward Everett Horton plays an insignificant role and none of the other players can give a life appearance to this mess. It's like an amateur evening at the studio, even with the few professionals scattered among the actors. <br /> <br /> In summary: Painful and awkward interpretation of a musical Rodgers and Hart. I can not recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And even if the close-ups of Jeanette still radiate its beauty gossamer, this film is breathtaking.
