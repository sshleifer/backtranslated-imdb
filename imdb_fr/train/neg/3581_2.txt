I have not been able to decide if this movie is so bad that it's good, or, to quote Enid Coleslaw, "so bad that it went well and got bad again". Regardless, it has made me look a lot like a weird colored vomit, and it offers a number of scenes you will not forget, even if you wish. A sneering Ray Liotta tells a pig-tailed Pia that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis. A little later, Ray still agitates Pia, not with the appropriate shape trophy, but with a garden hose. There is a company at Pia Chin who tells her domineering mother that she wants to go to sleep with Ray's father geezer, Walter. The actress in the graveyard scene yells the best replica ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" There is again this garden hose, while Walter waves Pia's face and roars "Is that ok for you ?!" There is Pia and her date so lit up by chewing salad close-ups that people are starting to tear their clothes. Pia gets a shower but forgets to remove her dress. Perhaps the best of all, there is Pia's typewriter, but instead of keys, there are the miniature heads of those who tormented her the most (after that, I was scared of 'open my laptop). And finally, there's Pia at "The Awards" exposing Hollywood for the cloak he's doing, spitting out the second best line of all time, "I guess I'm not the only one ever to have to spawn a path to the top. "I see that I've already spent more time commenting on" The Lonely Lady "than better pictures, so I'll stop. Be aware, however, that once you start looking at yourself, you will probably not be able to leave the screen until two hours of your life are gone forever.
