Dave is divorcing and his spirit is returning to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should say he is concentrating on the past girlfriend. He remembers the day the relationship ended. Dream sequences only lack fuzzy transitions. He fondly remembers their favorite songs and the places they went. I am not a counselor, but maybe it had something to do with the failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets a woman of half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being "scared off" by his goosebumps, begins to take an interest in him. Did I mention how scary Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He does not move his arms when he walks. It's just weird. Too short, Dave plots to track down Mary (the old friend) and kill her ... uh ... I mean confront her. He does it What was really scary. He thinks she's married, and yet he's still flying halfway to cross the country to meet him. He steps over his house to make sure she is alone before "dropping". He has an embarrassing conversation with her that ends with sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less and returns to the new girlfriend. We enjoyed the film mainly for its unintended comic value. I'm still entertaining the woman with my impressions of Dave .... "I heard another song from Dave & Mary!"
