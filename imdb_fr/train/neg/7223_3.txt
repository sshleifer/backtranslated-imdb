My first attempt to watch this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the televised report, which I could not handle. It looked pretty much like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there is a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think it's aliens. * awkward silence * Reporter 1: Other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later, I watched it all the way, and it was not as horrible as I imagined, but there are serious problems with that. About half of the plot can be easily rejected. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something of the sort. <br /> <br /> What's the use of the detective, the eugenicists and the monsters that Horus gets rid of for a moment? More fun was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gods ", who have lived for centuries, and we play the monopoly of all the multiverse games." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken seems consistent, compared to that. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly lacking. What did our protagonist do to freeze? Why was there no big event when he was released at the end? He had those pesky followers, remember? What happened to normal humans? What's the problem with the masked guy? How did the blue haired girl appear? What is his view? Etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> Visually it's more or less good, if you ignore the Egyptian gods that look like toads with rotweiller heads.
