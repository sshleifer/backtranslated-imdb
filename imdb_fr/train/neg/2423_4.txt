I had this film at a private collector and I was very curious about it. He had a 7.8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and some external comments were nice. But I must say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. Yes, super cinematography, the film is well done, but it never panicked me. It starts well, but although it does not bother me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that go so normal that I did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can make a few laughs. And you can see some small breasts. But if you like the kind of giallos that I like (bizarre, surreal, senseless, bloody, bloody, atmospheric murders ...), you will not like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> I give him a 4 for good filmmakers and editors, and the final twists, which make the film entertaining. But that could be much better.
