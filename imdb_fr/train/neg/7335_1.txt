This is perhaps the worst version of the piece I've seen - many times on stage outside the movie. <br /> <br /> A very good idea for the staging - the southern United States can give a credible backdrop to the extreme. reaction around the supposed offense of Hero. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very well-mannered Béatrice who gives a particularly mediocre performance. Waterston, a good actor, is hardly better as Benedict. <br /> <br /> The poorest performance is Don John - Keanu Reeves looks good. Maybe the desire to make a caricature on the model of the villain that links the girl to the railroad tracks fits perfectly with the keys of dogberry kops capers and his men - but the actor makes you want to cringe. <br /> <br /> Among the successful installations, we can mention the scene where they cheat Benedict XVI by making him believe that Beatrice loves him - if the actors were competent, it would be superb. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benoît getting closer are well produced. <br /> <br /> Overall, I had to force myself to keep watching but that certainly did not catch my attention. <br /> <Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comments above, I'm almost 40 years old. I've watched Shakespeare productions on stage and on screen for over two decades. May I suggest, when you try to defend your friends, to talk about the play rather than attack other critics when you are so badly armed in terms of fact. I can assume, however, because of your disgust for the youth, that you are old enough to play more time. <br /> <br /> My favorite couple was Rylance and McTeer on the London scene. . Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic interpreter, can act.
