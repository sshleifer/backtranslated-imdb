It is a superficial hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a young woman's project jealous of separating her father and fiancee. Is it an incest or just a sight through the eyes of a girl with an Electra complex? We do not care? With the exception of Anne (Deborah Kerr), all the characters are empty and empty. Seberg is poor (I agree with the comment "boys with breasts" from a previous comment). The plot took place. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of film that was unfortunately stretched over an hour and a half! If you want to see beautiful dresses and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend "To Catch a Thief" - in which you will get the added bonus of an entertaining story and friendly characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies to entertain me. Personally, I do not really care about where a movie is going. Whatever the time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see nice characters. It does not hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a very good performance, just like David Niven in a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The note "2" concerns only Kerr and Niven, and the cinematography - the scenes in color black and white scenes obscure and disturbing. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography of the world can not save a mediocre story with unpleasant characters. The ear of a sow is always the ear of a sow. As a result, watching this mess has been a serious waste of time.
