The stereotyped sending of slasher films is far from being a supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby and all the actors are totally lost. Dishonest jokes abound and every typing line is well telegraphed. The dumb linings arrive at a rapid pace and almost all fall flat like a crushed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lasts throughout the movie. Another disadvantage is the claustrophobic climate that hides entirely in the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and look for one of the really fun films of "Lampoon" as "National Lampoon Golddiggers" - MERK
