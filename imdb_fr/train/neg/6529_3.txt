This film is funny and painful at the same time. The "Cinemagic" almost made me a crisis. Despite what they imply, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical procedure. It was "developed" as a result of an accident, and they used it because it hid the fact that their "monsters" looked so stupid. I do not think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". <br /> <br /> This film is good for laughter, if you are really looking for a film shot in 200 days at $ 200,000. It's funny; at least I can say as much. The bat / rat / spider is the culmination.
