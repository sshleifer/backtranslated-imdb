As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) look at this very, very boring picture. This is the first color film of Miss Dietrich, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Bad start. The story is extremely painful and concerns a subject that bothers me: religious guilt. (Who needs it?) Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all Dietrich's films (and I've seen most, especially "Pittsburgh"), it's the only one where even his performance is hardly worth watching. The color photography is correct (very recent version of Technicolor), but without any goal. Cast ridiculous: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (you've said enough?). The only thing that is of interest is the caricature of John Carradine who interprets "The Sand Diviner", who predicts everything that will happen. The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Yet another example of David O. Selznick's very exalted reputation (has he ever made a great movie other than this one?) And, last but not least, the MGM DVD soundtrack is a disaster, with apparently randomized volume levels. Very disadvised.
