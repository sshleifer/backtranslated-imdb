Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? This is surely not a serious thriller? Nothing indicates that there is intentional humor, but on a few occasions, the mediocre actor, the poor director and the terrible scenario made the audience laugh at the movies. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist has just reached its peak, shot by an assassin on whom he falls by mistake. The killer sees the work portfolio of young artists he is wearing and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. During the exhibition, the assassin meets the sister of the deceased artists who end up falling in love. All this is very predictable and the end will have nobody to guess because it is so badly written. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows how beautiful it is. However, do not waste your time on this film unless you are studying how to NOT play, direct or script a movie!
