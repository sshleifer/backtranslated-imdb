The reason I wanted to give this film a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and, hopefully, appreciate the cinema Indian. All the movies I've seen are some older movies from S.Ray. <br /> <br /> Browsing IMDb, I came across this one. and bring artistic pleasure. Oh my how I was wrong! The only logical explanation for this score of 8.7 is that most of the 970 people who voted are Indians and their production outside of Bolliwood production was Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> With this rating, this movie would be ranked 9th on IMDb List of the top 250 movies above Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm really not in the mood to review and criticize because I do not remember anything about this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindus who, like me, find this film as it is - just stupid, with an abundance of kitschy and old-fashioned music.
