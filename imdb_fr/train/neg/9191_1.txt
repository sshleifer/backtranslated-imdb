Well, I had to sit in front of the computer and write the review immediately after watching that mud puddle. Why? Because I have to let you know how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. Just to tell you how bad it is, I'll give you this little detail about the movie. During scenes of chaos, which usually consist of people shooting or killing zombies, they interconnect scenes of the video game. Yes, you heard me well. This film is really bad. In fact, it makes me think of the fact that today it costs ten dollars to enter the theaters. And see stuff stuffed with corn like that? There is no story to tell and the film has basically nothing to offer besides occasional boob shots and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed with that, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm stunned. It's so bad that I can not even find the words. NOTE: ZERO on *****.
