The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really dictate the direction that the majority of this film takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy living in New York in the 1950s. He has a burning desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his own mother and stepfather of course! How nice. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before seeing anything and he is sent back for the summer to his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife having sex. However, the woman is very pregnant and does not sleep together right now. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their free time hanging out between two girls. They have a small club where all they do is sit down and talk about sex. The problem is ... it's not done in a charming 1950's fashion, innocent and charming. I am not prude by ALL means, but I found it rather disturbing to listen to these children talk about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. This kind of brutality can work in a film like "Kids" (1995), but in this film, it just seems perverse. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely lost here as Hedy, an old bra model who becomes the object of Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander must stay as far as possible from the president. "For better or worse" (1996) was awful and now this. Such a waste. 1/10
