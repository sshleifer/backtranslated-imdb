This film was a real disappointment to me. I've been a Gram Parsons fan for a long time, and when I found out they were shooting a movie about him, I was very moved, I got the VHS movie when he came out and I was sickened by What I saw, This film was not about his life, but about the consequences of his death. I thought it would be a descent movie on Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a movie about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies, I wanted a film about his life, not about his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I wish people look at his life, more than his death. The only good thing about this movie was its soundtrack. This film is a disappointment for all fans of Gram Parsons.
