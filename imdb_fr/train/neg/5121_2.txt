I went in this film thinking that it would be a football drama (in the same vein as Remember the Titans); However, I left with the feeling of attending a sermon by Ted Haggard on the kidnapping. The only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the film. In fact, a televangelist's sermon would probably benefit more from this poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the sermon of the televangelist, there are quotations from the scriptures rather than quotes from the extensionist's pulp. The plot was totally too predictable to the point that anyone with a sufficiently long attention span could have had the entire plot in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
