Five minutes after watching this, I connected to IMDb to warn you not to bother with this movie ... like: horror? there were moments of slight suspense and throughout the film, I said to myself: "Something must happen soon". It was not the case. When the movie ended, I felt so embarrassed for the screenwriter / director that I was never the biggest fan patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror movie, I am no longer the biggest fan of the world not to look at another of his works .. <br /> <br /> I was taken care of by the summary of the intrigue please do not make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors..they were not bad and it was not there fault because they had such a bad direction ...
