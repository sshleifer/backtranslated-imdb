This film is similar to the play entitled "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost woman and a medium are strongly related to Coward's writing. I am surprised that films of this nature do not recognize the concept of the original author. I realize that the public may not be aware that it's an imitation, but it's sad. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are so expensive to produce. I feel good when a scenario is original. I even rejoice when it comes to an innovative way of producing a work that has been previously published. Some samples have been mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I am not happy when the taste of the public is taken for granted. In this situation, the tastes of the public are neglected. <br /> <br /> I look forward to receiving better quality movies. <br /> <br /> In this case. I prefer to see the room.
