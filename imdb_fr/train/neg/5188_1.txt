TV drivers, do not you like them? Quinn Martin has tried this one after being successful in many other crime movies, but this one is not going anywhere except in the area of ​​the MST where he belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who gets his Aunt Mary's order to find the super spy Lovejoy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic relief and not much. Tree is bad as a villain despite all his disguises that make him look exactly like he is normally. There is more fiber of unnatural clothing than you can ever imagine (needed in the 1970s) and the show itself is anti-climatic. Why did not he go in series? You understand it, it's pretty obvious. Again, it's fun for MST, but not much else !!
