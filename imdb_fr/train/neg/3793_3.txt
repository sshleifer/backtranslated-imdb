The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It does not look like the original story of the ETA Hoffman on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In ballet, the story is essentially over at the end of the second semester when Clara (or Mary in this version) goes to the Kingdom of Sweets to watch a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There is an endless variety of theatrical productions that reinterpret history in many ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the low ballet libretto. <br /> <br /> Balanchine's version has absolutely no sense of drama or history (despite the fact that Tchaikovsky's wonderful first-act music is full of mystery and drama). The result is a completely forgotten first half Christmas party, where almost nothing happens and where even the dance (the bit there is) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> The overworked pantomime, especially Drosselmeier, which may seem passable on stage, looks ridiculous to film for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better when we come to the candy kingdom (Act II in the version scene). Although there are some choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is bland and uninteresting. It is certainly not a vintage balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt he had less success as a creator of narrative ballets. To watch this film version of his theatrical production of The Nutcracker has only reaffirmed this point of view.
