Somewhere on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, you just had to read them. I agree with that. However, we love the adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike reminds us that without good writers, it is difficult for actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation for a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well played and kept the essence of the time and the constraints imposed on the characters (except for the weird parade and kissing in the street scene in Bath). . The 2007 version shows a twitty Anne who seems anxious. The other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen nuances. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel was completely upset, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's abnormal and impoverished classmate, walks to Bath - - strumming, as many characters seemed to be doing. The strength of character and intelligence of Captain Wentworth, who prompted Anne to love her in the first place, do not appear to have been written in Rupert Penry-Jones' Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey a lot more with a look that P-J was able to do with his poses. Overall, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel to a costumed melodrama of questionable value. If they wanted to integrate our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with adaptations of Shakespeare: adapt it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was removed from the historical and geographical setting and was fun to watch, as was "Clueless". It was not PERSUASION, but they did not know what to call it.
