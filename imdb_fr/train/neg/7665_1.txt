Honestly, I do not mind spending my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is just too short. What I am going to say is that, alone in the dark, only succeeds in three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. He succeeds in launching several useless intrigues in the air but in releasing them all. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. Dr. Boll, if that's what you are (I'm thinking of proctology here), what are you doing in the chair? a director?
