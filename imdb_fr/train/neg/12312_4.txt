For 50 years after the Second World War, the United States was in a state where the main segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time, because of drafts and wars, everyone in society had served or was in contact with someone who had it. <br /> <br /> This allowed a minigenre based on the notion of American intelligence in the middle of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes this machine was a non-American army, for example in POW situations. Once deleted, stories are found in other machines: science fiction and business, but they still refer to this military genre and, in fact, the testosterone action plans even refer to their comical brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> perhaps starting with the comic, that is to say in American, parts of "The Great Escape", which immediately generated the offspring of TeeVee in "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros". Then a second wave triggered by "Catch 22" and "MASH", both of which were real life, then books, then movies and, in the case of MASH, then TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But before all that, there was the "Phil Silvers Show", about a sergeant Bilko, followed by "Mister Roberts". A happy scammer, who committed only harmless crimes, and then only in reaction to a rude system that tried to limit his life. It was the day that TeeVee's shows were important. You absorbed them instead of just wearing them to work chatting. It was not particularly clever except to find that slit between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> This is a vast area in which the Americans have determined how they envision lying, even attaching, in a military context, an area that has been appropriated by one of our parties policies here. <br /> <br /> Because it's big, it's sometimes worth it to laugh. "Stripes" was damn funny, I thought. He had the involvement of the unsuited who defeated serious enemies, somehow incorporating "Dirty Dozen". And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now, this, well before the escalation of cultural wars. He tries to touch that perfect place, like the other remakes that hurt Steve Martin. It's so unpleasant for the Army to become the strongest player. Yet another way to track how corporations control military power. <br /> <br /> Rating of Ted - 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.
