Knowing the comics of Enki Bilal for some time, I had to see this movie. I thought it would be a good way for the artist as Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I'd enjoy watching it ... I was wrong! The film was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but, the film leaves much to be desired, and basically all those who see this film feel that it could do it better. I will not make any suggestion as to whether you should see this movie or not. If you read these pages, chances are you've seen it before or are going to see it - but prepare for a very bad 102-minute period.
