NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I like horror movies, but it's the most mediocre attempt to make one. Calling it "a movie" is also a stretch. This video should not be viewed as "random, violent, obviously fictional, and women-tempting-sexy-edited-badly-edited-together snippets." <br /> <Look at this is about as interesting as looking at random family vacation photos, and it's about the same quality as expected when you send your ten-year-old son to the woods with your new video camera, and that you tell him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
