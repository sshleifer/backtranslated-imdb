I am sorry to announce that I have seen this movie several times. When he bombed at the box office, it was repeated every night for about a month on HBO. And I watched it again and again because television in general is so bad - or was it at that time. I'm not looking at it anymore, so it could be wonderful now - as Samuel L Jackson says about pork, "it may taste sweet pie, but I'll never know because I will not eat this dirty fish. " Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, still a few steps from Moses. It came out right after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration comes from. The slightly amusing bits last far too long until you close your eyes and clench your teeth. There is a scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both drawn and desiccated, dying of thirst. Then they meet as old acquaintances who do not know each other very well, promise to have lunch. It could have been funny. <br /> <br /> But the scene I remember most clearly is an encounter with a pharaoh during which Pharaoh is a black street kid wearing a reigning king's costume. He had to read the lines directly because at some point before the release, they had crushed his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of Black Street Lingo voiced by a Wannabe of Jimmy Walker (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or maybe Jimmy Walker - who knows? We do not care. They managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a long, very foolish, very legendary piece of feces, one of those legendary things that just can not blush, no matter how many times you try, then you leave it there for someone else to treat. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my opinion. If you rent this movie (do not buy it, no matter what you do!), Get ready with a bottle of tequila and a six-pack of Corona. <br /> <br /> Now that they have redone the Poseiden adventure, this is probably at the top of the list for remakes. Maybe they will hire a comedy writer this time.
