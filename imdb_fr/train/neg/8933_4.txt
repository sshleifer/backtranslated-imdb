Looking at that last night, I was surprised to see that Fox spent so much money on his investment and that he has little money. This is the kind of disaster that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the first morning of her shooting, Raquel Welch was sprinkled on her chimney to prepare for a place at the Oscars. would surely win for this audaciously original movie. Oops. That's not what happened. <br /> <br /> The internal struggles on the set were detailed by Rex Reed and it helped the film gain a reputation even before its release. When he was finally released, there was not the usual circus of three-ring advertising. If I remember correctly, in Houston, he opened in movie theaters by car and in neighborhood theaters and never performed in any of the big halls. <br /> <br /> I'm the main director of director Michael Sarne, who was hot after directing JOANNA, a movie with music about young people in London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox ended up firing him and assembling the film as best as he could. This is why the scenes do not take place in a particular sequence and the characters appear and then disappear. An impressive cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To enlarge, many excerpts of Fox movies featuring stars such as Carmen Miranda (in beautiful images of THE GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy, who had never dreamed to play in a movie rated X. <br /> <br /> The X rating is due to many occasional sexual perversions; However, none of the characters seem to have fun. Someone involved in the film might have a distorted Puritan sensibility and thought that if they could make these things unattractive, it was not bad to exploit them. <br /> <br /> It was one of the pictures of "young people" who nearly went bankrupt. Hollywood in the 1970s. One author joked that EASY RIDER (which was made to change pocket) was the most expensive film ever made, as many films followed, which unsuccessfully attempted to duplicate his success . Sixtyish, who has already honored directors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, has directed films like RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract young audiences. White directors and writers have tried to make films to attract black audiences. These films are locked somewhere in a safe and the two people named and many other similar films have never, as I know, been broadcast on video or cable. This is the darkest secret of the studios. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch's performance in this area is, in all respects, very good. With the right direction and the right scenario, she could embody the kind of sassy liberated women that Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck have specialized. She is beautiful and has great costumes. Mae West is the most animated actress of the seventy years I've ever seen. On the one hand, it's a bit heartbreaking to see her trying to conquer her glory in years past, but I'm sure she needed that money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget X-rated film from this era goes beyond the valley of infants (also from Fox) because it does not take itself seriously. They are crazy kids playing with equipment in a big studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is trying to say something. There was no one who wanted to listen.
