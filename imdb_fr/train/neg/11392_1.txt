For years, I remember reading about Trouble With Tracy in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6am! I lived about a two-hour drive north of Toronto and we could not get a CFTO, but you know how it goes - we always want what we can not have. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this "Trouble With Tracy" was about. Did he have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was there nudity? Was there any suspense? Was it a comedy? It would have been nice if there had been a promotion of the show. At least I could have known what was missing. But no! The mystery made me crazy, until CKCO, a CTV affiliate, built a rebroadcasting station in Wiarton, Ontario, and began broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" along with CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 o'clock !! One Saturday morning, I got up and I turned on the television at 5:59 and I finally could see what was "The Trouble With Tracy". Yes, the "problem with Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and he was stuck in the innocuous six o'clock area so that no one would ever see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years later, but many would say he was "dead" the first time he appeared on the show. When I saw it for the first time this cold Saturday morning and I fell back into my bed, part of me died too.
