We laughed our heads. This scenario is so unbelievable that you zap on CNN or sleep. <br /> <br /> My father has been a captain for 30 years. He could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> During his experience as an officer, he has already claimed command of the ship, the captain has drunk 3 bottles of whiskey a day and (sorry) s ** t on his desk. Of course, it was not a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, a fire in the kitchen is the most important thing on any ship, whether nuclear or not. Giving an exercise at this time is only Hollywood script. When a captain is arrested, he is arrested, you take all his keys and open the vault where the weapons are stored. This is stored in a few minutes in a well-kept room. He CAN NOT escape, it's like in prison. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room. It's not done, never. My father cleaned up all the damage done by the dog, wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington attribute the three stars to this movie. All the rest are bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> When we know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this movie takes on an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller on a submarine rental: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
