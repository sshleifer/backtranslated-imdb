I do not know why Spike Lee made this movie wreck a film and convinced poor Stevie Wonder to forever link his beautiful music to this theatrical disorder. I am also unhappy with the way he uses blasphemy as part of the normal prose of black professionals. The abuse of its grip on ethnic moviegoers is a shame. Scenes that look artificial and have nothing to do with the theme or sub-themes play as if a child had written that. I especially hate the ridiculous scene where the two protagonists argue in a playful way for no reason and where the cops manage to brutalize Snipes. The over-capacity of the tracks suggests that Spike has no respect for his viewers or that he has no idea what a movie is. The final scene seems to be projected to justify the use of a hammer. This film also confirms the myth that all people in culture use the word F in their informal conversations. I hope he will realize that the rest of his films are in the same pool as this one where he does not grow as a filmmaker. I think his union with Scorcesee at Clockers was a wise move. He should continue to make documentaries like the Four Little Girls Colored. Shock films do not make an Oscar.
