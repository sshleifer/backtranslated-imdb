I will spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script. This is the worst continuation of our life. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Mark Blankfield's performance was not only GOD-AWFUL, but everyone was different !! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script appeared to have been written by Mongolian monkeys using pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How did the producers manage to get those excrements of cinematography out of my reach? They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston a buffoon without talent. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want the 96 minutes of my life spent watching this troubled memory of a brilliant comedy in order to condemn all the people involved in this cinematic atrocity.
