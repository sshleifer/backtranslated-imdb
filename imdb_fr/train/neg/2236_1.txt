I do not really know where to start. Playing in this movie was really horrible, I do not remember seeing so many actors in a movie who were not able to act. Not only was the acting bad, but the characters were incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there is the action. I believe that even children know that when someone is shot, blood is involved. But when someone is shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. Well, I guess it's only me. <br /> <br /> To make a story short (because, believe me, I can continue for hours about this movie), it's without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This film should definitely be number 1 in the last 100.
