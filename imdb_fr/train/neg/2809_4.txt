When I think back to my years at Ohio University, there will always be an event that I will remember with good memories. Channel 23 is the local access channel of the OU and until the last few years it broadcast almost everything that was sent to it. This included many DIY movies, ranging from marshmallow peeps in the microwave to scanned online photos, to a version of Macbeth featuring eighth graders, who apparently had just learned how to make squibs. . <br /> <br /> However, the king, in my opinion, of the channel 23 programming was Midnight Skater. The first time I watched it was around 2 o'clock in the morning. I should have studied. Or sleep. Or watch ordinary television. But no, all that's for the pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and once finished, I do not think any of us thought any of the movies had happened. But of course, it was a few nights later and we had to understand that this movie did exist. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on and say how awful it is, but it's the kind of awful thing that makes life worth living. The plot is disjointed, the acting is terrible, everything that marks the soul, but by God, if there are others who are watching you, it is impossible not to have a good time to to look at it. It's a bit like the first time you hear Chuck Pahalniuk's Guts. You hear it, you're disgusted and upset, but five minutes later, all you want and want is to make someone else live the abject horror you've just experienced. <br /> <br /> Long story, Midnight Skater, for all its epic faults allow to have fun very late at night. In addition, I desperately want the theme of the midnight skateboarder. Congratulations to anyone who wrote and sang it. Sweet god I like this song.
