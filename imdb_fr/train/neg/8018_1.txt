Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should have given rise to a very good movie, and the main actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the subject, but the scenario - if there was even one scenario - was a mess. It's less a movie than a random show that leads nowhere. I would say it's not going anywhere, except it's actually the longest 81 minutes you've ever had. As I mentioned, the main actor is good. So, Faruza Baulk (SP?) Is her sometimes hard mother, but ultimately loving and tolerant. Filmmakers have a lot to answer because it's a mess. It's really a shame because I really wanted to love this film, but it's essentially a film that was never shot. Skip this one - it was not even worth the $ 6 I disbursed for the pay-per-view.
