This TV thriller is all talk, little action. He strives to set up his intricate plot, but the writing is so confusing that the show is still cloudy at best. In the end, I did not know more about these characters than at the beginning. He has a "Little Little Indians" scenario, but drops it halfway in favor of bringing Sally Field to light and finding a murderer. Field exaggerates here with a lack of grace that I have rarely seen of her. The first introductions are good, but the writing quickly disappears and ends up going beyond. A lot of hysteria and constant thunder and lightning effects (which do not add anything). A curious failure of the producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, could not they give us something other than a script filled with red herring and Sally Field hidden in a closet?
