this film has its advantages: the hot chicks die <br /> <br /> the problem ... the hot barley chicks undresses and we do not see many people die, especially many fast movements and screaming well that There were two good scenes of killing. <br /> <br /> Also for those of you who are watching this for JENNA JAMESON, she is just a secondary chearator with a very small role and bare nude scenes. <br /> <br /> What this movie needed ... the screenplay and the story would be fine, but I will not complain about that .. just: you need more nudity and better shooting scenes because that's why we're watching these movies ... <br /> <br /> I would not waste my money on that ... and if you have to, wait for it on the old shelves of your local video store
