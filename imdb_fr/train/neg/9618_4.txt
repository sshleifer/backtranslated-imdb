I must say that even though this film has always been a formula with a stolen plot of movies like Friday the 13th / I know what you did last summer, this movie was not so bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most Hollywood horror movies recently released. The murders, although sometimes a little too imaginative, were in most cases original. The cast was mediocre, which can be expected from low budget features, but far better than the much larger Artisan / Lions Gate studio. My only real complaint, which was not due to the budget of the film, which was supposed to be small, was the artificial end. I'm sorry but that's what put this film in the wrong category for me. The end was just stupid and hung up. Before that, I was a little bored, but I really enjoyed it. 4/10
