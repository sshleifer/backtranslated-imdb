Look, this is the third one, so you already know it's bad. And "Maniac Cop" was not good enough to justify the second installment, so you know it's even worse. But how much worse? He is frightful, he is approaching God. <br /> <br /> When Maniac Cop goes into a killing, a reporter exclaims, "What happened here can only be described as a black death rainbow." 1-> Rainbows are not black and can never be black. 2 - Rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death. 3-- A journalist, a valuable asset for his agency, could find another way to describe the consequences of a killing. "A black rainbow of death" is not the only way to describe the situation. <br /> <br /> That's what you'll do.
