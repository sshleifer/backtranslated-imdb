do not let yourself be praised for renting this movie. It has nothing to do with a death row escape, despite the title. I can not think of one good thing to say about the film. Bad acting, bad editing, poor staging ... a laughable "plot", and the sound / music was so irritating that it's amazing that this movie does not have a warning label. The only possible way to watch this movie and enjoy it is for its historical quality. They only make movies as bad.
