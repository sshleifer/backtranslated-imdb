From everything I read about the movie, I was excited about supporting a film on a Christian theme. Everything in the film was done in a very unprofessional way. Especially the writing! Without good writing, a movie has no chance. The author / director stated in an interview that he did not want to reveal the link between the title and the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I kept waiting for the story of adolescence / young adult to unfold, but it never happened. As a person who had a divorce, I was very disappointed. This film would have been NO comfort for me when I went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
