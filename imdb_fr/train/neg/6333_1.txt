I actually saw this movie at the theater. As soon as I gave my money back to the cashier, she said two words I had never heard in the theater before or since: "No refund!" As soon as I heard those words, I should have just said goodbye to my money and gone home. But no, stupidly, I walked in and watched the movie. This film did not make anyone laugh at the theater. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Most of the time, we sat in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone would shout, "This film sucks!" The audience applauded enthusiastically, then sat there in a deafened and bored silence for another ten minutes.
