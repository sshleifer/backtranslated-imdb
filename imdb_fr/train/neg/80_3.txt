I must say that I am really surprised at the high rating given to this film. I found it absolutely stupid. Does the mother have "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice was that her vision continues ... seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was horrible, I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played the role of Lori did a good job, as did most of the main actors for what they had to work with. <br /> <br /> I usually like LMN and I'm very open-minded when it comes to movies, but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and on the acting top and it just was not for me.
