This is supposed to be a comedy but mostly a bad taste, and nothing causes a smile in the film. The film tells the story of a couple trying to get a child and the people who are in this situation in real life will wince at the representations that are represented. For example, the scenes of a fertility clinic are not at all funny and frankly embarrassing. The main character who plays the role of a construction worker and his helmet is a poor excuse for a rejection of Village People. The main woman is trying to look 20 years younger than her. Both tracks are unattractive, unattractive and totally unconvincing. There are various ridiculous and totally unpretentious free scenes in the film, for example with a low-cost airline, devoid of humor. The only reason I give this score of 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a note for Shirley Maclaine, which is a class above anything else in the photo, and a note for pretty decent music ( though old).
