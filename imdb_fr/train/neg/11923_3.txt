A clandestine immigrant resists the social support system, which has disastrous consequences for many. Well filmed and played even if the story is a little forced, the slowness of the pace allows to conclude. The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively transmitted. The little person lost in big society is something that we can all associate with, but I can not endorse you to see this movie.
