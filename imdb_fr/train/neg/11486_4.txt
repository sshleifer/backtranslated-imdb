Because some people, like me, like to know everything about a movie, even if they plan to see it, including the end. Anyway, here's the end as I remember it, because I could not be more than 8 years old when I saw it for the first and only time on television. But I'll tell you, it scared the little kid I was, and I thought about it for days, and it's still in my mind, even if some of the details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember! I did not even remember that old Barnabus was in this movie and I loved the dark shadows. So, in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is attracted to the judge (Joseph Cotton, I suppose, even though I remember him as being a former family doctor or something instead of a judge; see how memory fades?) to the place of marriage, which, if I remember correctly, is in some cavern? Maybe I'm wrong; and Shelley Winters is laughing, and the judge has a cloak and the angle of the camera rather looks at him, and he throws off the cloak and has the legs of a goat, and he announces that he is actually her father, the devil, and she played in their hands (of the satanic cult), because the "mortal" type that she fell in love with (I suppose it's Robert Foxworth) turns out to be also the type that Satan wants to marry, The Demon with Yellow Eyes, and yes, of course, they show Robert Foxworth and his eyes shine yellow. There are many close-ups in the last minutes of the film. Everyone laughs and rejoices, with the exception of Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and who cries or screams or something like that, and that's the end. The bad guys win.
