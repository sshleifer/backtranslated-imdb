Even if it's a R-rated movie, I really doubt that you'll really appreciate it unless you're a teenager. <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has a lot of nudity is. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked girls (nice pretty I could add) to feast your eyes. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand why this film has the title American Pie, because it's just a bad combination between an erotic film and a comedy without being able to be one or the other . <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie only if you want to see naked girls, but you are too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> He gave 1/10 for the 2 smiles I had in the whole movie and another 2/10 for the pretty girls
