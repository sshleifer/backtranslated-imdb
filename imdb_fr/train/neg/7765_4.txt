Strange, almost all critics are very positive about this movie. Is it because it is in 1975 and that Chamberlain and Curtis are part of it and therefore forgive the very bad times and childish ways of telling stories? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because some people are moved by this movie because they read the book? (I have not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, filmmakers never assume that viewers have read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because I am unconsciously irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors are trying to behave like their French counterparts?
