At first glance at the cover of this photo, it looks like a good rock'n'roll movie. But do not let the cover fool you, nor the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The scenario is simply horrible, as is the actor. Simply and simply: BAD <br /> <br /> This is not a film on a roadie, it's just a thin love story, so horrible that you see it well. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it was not for music, it would be 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and the girl who plays the groupie is not even beautiful! This film was a huge disappointment for me because it makes a lot of good promises.
