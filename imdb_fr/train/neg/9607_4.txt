Do not listen to the misleading title "Werewolf Woman". Europeans are well known for focusing on sex and nudity rather than real fears in their horror films, but this is a bit too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a sordid sex scene ripped off with the main character who goes crazy and brutally kills his partner. Have fun the first time, but a hundred minutes quickly becomes very monotonous. She is not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can not even decide on its tone, the first ten minutes (a flashback) being a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I should be a classic after the trash), a rather poor study of the victim woman character from abuse and torture to a revenge thriller. In the end, the director insists that this is based on a true story. Yes OK. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are some fun aspects of the production. The title of werewolf woman is a spectator and there are some beautiful effects of gore and nude scenes. However, these quickly become rather monotonous. In addition, the doubled dialogue is quite hilarious in a camp style, especially the most influential doctor in the world (he drinks at work). Unfortunately, the film quickly becomes irritating. There is no real plot or anything else. It's a shame, because reading a description, I thought the film had real potential. "Werewolf-Woman" is too long, slow and a little too vain, even from the point of view of the kind of exploitation. (4/10)
