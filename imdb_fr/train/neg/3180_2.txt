What a boring movie! In summary, Nana Patekar was beaten by her daughter-in-law, Karisma Kapoor, as she tried to flee the village with her son. Can anyone say BORING ??? The concept was not too bad, but it was poorly executed. Canadian locations and some village scenes were well filmed. However, overall, cinematography has not been satisfactory. The story could have been great, but the movie seemed to drag on. There is only stupidity that a person can take, let alone three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishq Kamina", which lasted only five minutes. Other than that, this movie was a piece of shit.
