This film has many problems that make it turn out to be a low budget class project from a person at a film school. I must, however, recognize the merit of his campiness. Many times in the film, I found myself laughing hysterically. It was sometimes so funny that it was funny, which made it a fun watch. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low quality movie to slash with a touch of psychological horror and a hint of campy ridicule, then pop a bowl of popcorn, invite friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments to say that the sound is very bad. The dialogue is almost impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is a bit right there.
