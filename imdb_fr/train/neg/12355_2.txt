After reading many reviews, I do not know which movie some people were watching, but it was clearly not the same as the one I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. The acting game, mainly Moore's, is simply terrible. The woman can not act. Nice tits, but she just can not act. At no point did she appear to be the real character. Instead, she was spoiled. The Hollywood actress goes to the beach to pretend with the boys. <br /> <br /> And that's what this film is ultimately: pretending to Hollywood. The training sequences are above. Politics - from above. Politically correct - over it. The fight scenes - you guessed it, above. Your mission is to enter and exit without being detected. So what are you doing? Why do so many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my winger at any time. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but as soon as Hollywood takes it, we end up with Top Gun with breasts. <br /> <br /> What more are American commercial movies expected? Not much, I guess.
