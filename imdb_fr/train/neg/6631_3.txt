Ram Gopal Verma has proved to be a very innovative and competent director. He had made a remake / reworking of Godfather with Sarkar and had been enormously successful. Ditto for Lolita that he realized under the pseudonym of Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay is the film he repeats many times and has inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing remake and finally boring. <br /> <br /> The acting game went from decent to very good, Amitabh Bachchan being sufficiently threatening as a naughty Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were awful and forgettable. Mehbooba Mehbooba is a second-rate music video. <br /> <br /> The worst is stimulation and dialogue, which are forgettable. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie at the cinema I found myself waiting for the intermission, then the end. Some viewers were advised not to wait and were seen leaving for the duration of the film. In the end, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
