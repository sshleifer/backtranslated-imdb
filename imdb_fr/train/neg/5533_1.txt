Before the release of Night of the Living Dead, a definition of George Romero's genre, zombies were relatively wise creatures. They certainly had much better ways to eat in the past. But social etiquette aside from the thrills that these first zombies offered to the cinema audience? Judging by this movie, not at all. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, whose goal is to find and destroy the secret of the zombie. One of the guests discovers the secrets himself and begins to build his army of zombies. <br /> <br /> This film is essentially a love triangle with zombies. But since it's a 1930s movie, the zombies are more like sleepwalkers than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. They seem to respond to a control of the mind rather than an insatiable appetite. And, frankly, the "revolt" is also a little disappointing. The whole thing is really very boring. Aside from the lack of horror, there is no exaggerated melodramatic theater to entertain us. It seems unlikely that it could have provided much entertainment 70 years ago. See if you should see everything with 'zombie' in the title but if not, I would advise you to skip this one.
