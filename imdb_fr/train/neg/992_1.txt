This movie was disgusting. Their should be a warning that a nasty sadistic writer is trying to make a name for himself before being held hostage for an hour and a half looking at garbage. What is the trash? The misuse of people's time, the misuse of energy and the waste of any kind of educational system that taught him to read and write. Talia, you are a crazy sick loser. Your psychiatrist must prescribe more effective medications for your problem. <br /> <br /> The acting and the plot left me with no choice but to move quickly in the middle of the trash. I found myself at a scene that was unjustified. If you want to learn how to shock people, watch a movie by Larry Clark. I lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie "more support from me". How could actors or actresses sit on a set while such crude representations of human behavior manifest themselves from the mind of a psychopath? I'm sorry for all the actors who participated in this scene. I think the devil now knows who is the author of this movie; Congratulations, you have caught his attention.
