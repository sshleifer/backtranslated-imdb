Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving an incessant series of disappointments and traumas, she relieves her anger of the closest targets. <br /> <br /> When she sees the violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she has found her home. <br /> <br /> The film progresses from there, while Diana learns the usual lessons of the transition to adulthood as well as the skills necessary to succeed boxing. Michelle Rodriguez plays very well in the role, especially when she expresses the rage of a young woman surrounded on all sides and struggles not only against personal circumstances, but also against the established sexism. <br /> <br /> The image could show some finesse. his leadership of all the young actors, which pales in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. There are too many breaks in the script, which decreases the dramatic tension. The general silence of the film drains it of intensity. <br /> <br /> This is a good image to see once, if only to see the power of a young woman fully realized and whose femininity is complex enough to include its power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the category "we see it again and again".
