Amateur to the extreme. The work of the camera is particularly overloaded - documentary filmmakers do not need to turn around ALL THE TIME. <br /> <br /> The scenario is really insane, and the acting is even worse. On top of that, the story is disjointed and winding - with some gaping holes in the logic. At one point, the leader wants to be thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with alleged agents of Al-Quada and get an interview with Osama. I found the story totally unbelievable because of so many faults. The main role of the "filmmaker" really represents an impetuous and reckless boy. The only interesting thing is that the filmmakers actually filmed on the spot. It's a shame they lost the opportunity to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this shit?
