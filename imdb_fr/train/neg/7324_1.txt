As a graduate in film studies, I would like to think that I have seen a wide range of films, good and bad, but I must say that the "summer rain" is by far the worst film I have ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that it would be a great British classic such as "Secrets and Lies" or "Lockstock" but oh no, it was so bad that my roommates and I had ended up laughing and scare us to ridicule of acting. and cheese script (reminded me of a bad school production "theater in education"). The main characters Michelle and Gary started to annoy us from the beginning. 'Michelle', the main character who lives with her two friends has the kind of face we would never tire of slapping and Gary was so wet (he kept crying every 5 minutes) that in the end, I I really do not care about one or the other. All I could think was "I paid Â£ 3 for this pile." I had never written a critic before, but after watching this film, it made me warn people about this disastrous production. So please avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
