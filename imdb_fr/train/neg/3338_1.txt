It took 9 years to complete this film. I would think that in those 9 years, someone would have said, hey, this movie is terrible. I saw better playing in porn movies. The story is tired and played. An abused child turns into a serial killer. How about something new for a change? How about the abused child turns into a florist? At least, that would have been a new twist. Why does everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially non-original film ideas) think he can be a director? I admire the fact that they stuck to this film for 9 years to finish it. It shows the tenacity and the spirit. Let's hope that next time they can focus on a better script. If you want to see a failed experience in making an independent film about a writer / director from Michigan, see Hatred of A Minute. If you want a good film from a writer / director from Michigan, stay with Evil Dead.
