Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was appalled by this disgusting representation of a man who was neither more nor less than a thief of cattle. Worse still, the common thread of all the film was sex in one form or another, implicitly or verbally. To see it, one might think that Scotland in the 18th century was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke acting as a "young" mother at 49 but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish loch is NOT trivial as they described it - but it gave them another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually motivated we were. Save your money and watch Pinnochio.
