This game was created by Sega. Made by Sega, I was not expecting much, but I did not expect that junk either. For starters, the camera angles are opposed to you in this game. The bike is your means of transport. The bike is the worst part of the game. Every time you meet something, you stay there and you do not move. Besides, you never fall from the bike or the wreck. The main character hardly speaks, even if he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You cross trees by bike. The camera makes it impossible to fight against the enemy. This game would not even be worth renting.
