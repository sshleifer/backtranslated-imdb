This movie was horrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I watched the first five minutes and the movie and I knew it was a bomb. The acting was bad and there was no conspiracy. monster is so fake Why would not they ask a doctor to play the xylophone to kill the monster. Just do not even waste your time. (1 of 10)
