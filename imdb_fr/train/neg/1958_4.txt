Where to start This film started as something that looked like a "Darkness Falls" scam. A disfigured old woman living in the woods, giving gifts to children for their teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls", the Tooth Fairy killed you only if you saw it. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and their sister? I think the film would have been good without them. Looks like the producers sat down and decided that they needed to hire extra people in the movie so the Tooth Fairy would have people to kill. Although it is nice to see a pretty blonde girl not be described as a bubble of change. Agree to rent, but I would not advise to buy it.
