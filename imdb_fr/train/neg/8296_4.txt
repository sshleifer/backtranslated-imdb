Basically, a team of husband and wife dentists and their three daughters are unfaithful. The premise is interesting, the acting is good and the music, though sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The husband dentist puts his wife behind the scenes of an opera before the show (she has a minor role), then returns to give him something, but sees it with another man. The rest of the film talks about his anguish about this episode, his visual hallucinations and his macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, one of his former patients) and his fear of confronting his wife for fear of having to " do something". "I will not tell you the end, but let me say that the film is not going anywhere and that the end looks like a groan." The motivations of the characters are missing: why is he cheating? decent appearance, good father, the movie does not say, who does it with, do not expect answers about it either, why does he want to keep the wedding despite all this? all children who vomit? Where does this movie go? The good performances of Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are completely ruined by this quaint absurdity who does not know if she wants to be American Beauty or a movie A root canal is more interesting, avoid it.
