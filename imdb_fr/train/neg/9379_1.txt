This film . . . I do not know. Why would they take a character as indelible as Pippi Longstocking and throw Tami Erin, a person without charm, I'll never know. Why they would spend money in the art direction and in some special effects that are not so bad, so do not bother to change it properly, I'll never know. Why the sets and costumes are sometimes at the time, and sometimes strangely, why they ordered such bad song, why the scenario has no meaning (not even at the silly level of the children's movie). . . . what were they thinking ?? Nothing in this film is exactly as it should be. Each part is dubbed (and always very bad), each sound effect is a bit wrong, each edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. He manages to create a proper atmosphere, despite all the problems, but he NEVER captures the magic created by Astrid Lindgren.
