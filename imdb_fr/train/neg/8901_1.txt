I'm going to make this short and sweet .... this movie sucked !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched Part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest movies ever, gave 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought that parts 2 and 3 might be good, I was wrong. This film bored me to death and was so different from the first one, it had the plot going on and that's it. It was like bad shots of the first game or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig was in this film, but do not miss out. There was a full cast with actors and people I do not like, like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest characters in the world. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you look a little less like the first, so do not look at it closely because you feel you owe it to yourself, as a Part 1 fan. wait a few days before watching Part 3 and I pray that it's better than this shit. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the movie with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on the film. Fast forward or jump to that if you can not stand the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 - it was horrible!
