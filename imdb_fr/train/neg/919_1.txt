Although I have to admit that I'm laughing more watching this movie than the last comedies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The budget should consist of a change of pocket of the actors. The production values ​​are so low that they made watching fun. It reminds me of the robotic monster of a guy in a gorilla suit wearing a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In a scene, an unfortunate victim has his arm and leg cut off. Damn, hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim had not started shouting "None Shall Pass" and "It's just a wound to the flesh, I got worse". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the past year. <br /> <br /> The "gladiator / demon" was also a point. Between the horribly cheap suit and the guy's geek look, the end result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that is bad enough to be watched. A bit like seeing an accident in slow motion on a movie. <br /> <br />
