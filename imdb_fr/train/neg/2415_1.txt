...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT RENT THIS FILM. If you want a documentary about "hood life", you're also in the wrong place. If you are looking for a laughable movie, it's a real winner! The acting game is as flat as a sheet of paper. The best example of this is certainly the agent investigating the passage. I can say that he made the voice of the 911 operator also by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talking, it would probably look like this guy. Oh yes, and the "zombies" made their best impression of a snake, which is comparable to their FANTASTIC general action (note the sarcasm ... HOW HAS IT NOT WON AN Oscar FOR THE BEST MAKE-UP? ) The Quiroz ...... did not do any kind of staging. I felt like I was watching a period of improvisation (the period looks more like that of the 1990's LA). The direction is however superimposed by the worst scenario that I think, never to adorn a film. I did not hear beautiful phrases like the epic of a word starting with the movie "F ** k!", Since Ice Grill which was another "urban" thriller. This only works of course with the epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or more songs! In the end, what did you expect from a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the intention of laughing at every scene, and he delivered it and MORE! I would definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to get together with a group of guys and make fun of a low budget horror movie (yes yes ...) for the night. A memorable experience for sure!
