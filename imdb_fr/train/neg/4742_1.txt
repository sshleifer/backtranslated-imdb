Sensational. It was probably the worst DCOM of all time. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays the role of Wendy, the popular girl with her boyfriend jock and her friends determined to become the queen of reunion. She is supposed to save the world as a warrior and Shin helps her to help her in her martial arts. Shin teaches him the techniques of snake, tiger, etc. She must learn some techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This film is ideal for children who want to get acquainted with martial arts and Chinese culture. but the acting and casting were horrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedy actress and I do not see her playing a serious role. It was funny to watch her crying on Shin. Shin could not act at all and everything was totally incredible. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar. What I imagined was the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the stunts were so powerful that it was just corny and stupid. The characters were not friendly and I could not stand watching him. Disney really needs to take the time to make decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, with other films like Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, and stuck in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action-adventure and nerdy jokes, you'll love this movie.
