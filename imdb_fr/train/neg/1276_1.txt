This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I repeat: This is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> He had all the marks of a bad film: errors of continuity, bad writing, bad interpretation, bad production value, bad music. I thought there were some points to horror movies. The first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you. This film gets and F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them, we are supposed to worry about it. This film also gets an F in this respect. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is mutilated by wolves after being afraid that it happens to him. The next story, a type of OCD dies of not paying attention and talks to one of his deceased friends. Oh, and then there is the horrible and heartbreaking story of a bad roommate. Come on, could you choose a little more interesting and a little less common subjects than being alone in a house, being anal-retentive and having a roommate? It turns out that all these stories are hallucinations, a virtual reality induced by a doctor who uses it in turn. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something to you. I like to watch bad horror movies and laugh at how bad they are. I could not do that with this one. It was extremely painful to sit and watch. Do not look at this film. You are going to regret it.
