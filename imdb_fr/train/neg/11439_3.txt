It was obvious that this film is designed to appeal to the public of Chick Flick, which I attended and enjoyed most. However, it was a very irritating attempt on the part of Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became annoying on her own). Her acting style was exaggerated and it seemed she was too free in comparison to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This film could have been more, because there was a proper budget for sets, actors and a decent story. My wife and I agreed that it was "Muck" at the end, the film ends on a painful and embarrassing spike! Good luck next time, hope that Miss Graham sticks to the type of movies she belongs to, like From Hell.
