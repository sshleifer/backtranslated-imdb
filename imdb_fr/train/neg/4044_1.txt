From the point of view of intrigue and movement, this movie was terrible. I found myself watching the clock in the theater hoping it would end and be relieved after 80 long minutes. Basically, five characters appear in the film, A Son & Father, the girlfriend of his son and two male characters of his son who appear and disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to suggest homoeroticism, but nothing has ever really revealed that way. There were some brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the film, the son's girlfriend shows up at a window outside his room and begins a strange conversation. Photography and acting have conferred an incredible seduction on the interaction between the two. She ended up admitting that she had another "older" man. End of this story.
