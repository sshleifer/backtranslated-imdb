Director Warren Beatty's intention to turn Chester Gould's famous comic book into a cartoon (with Beatty himself leading the role of the square jaw inspector) had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia - quite unusual and intriguing from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the photo is an indispensable ham, fun for a while but ultimately tiring. Dick Tracy tries to bring down the Big Boy Caprice gangster, helped by Tess Trueheart, but stumbled by the evil Breathless Mahoney. For about half an hour, the artistic direction and Oscar-winning sets are excellent, but as the plot cracks, as expected, things begin to freeze. Al Pacino had a surprise supporting the Oscar nomination as a villain Caprice, and Madonna (who is primarily used as a decorative prop) will sing "Sooner or Later (I always get my man)" from Stephen Sondheim, who won the price of the best original. Song. A lot of heart, thanks to Beatty - who was dedicated to his vision - but the photo is too cool and calculated. It lacks heat. * 1/2 of ****
