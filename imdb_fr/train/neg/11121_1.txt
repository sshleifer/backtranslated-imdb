I really do not understand how anyone could give this disgusting film more than one star ... How can you like such a film back home, where all scenes of animal abuse are real? I do not even want to imagine the excruciating pain felt by these innocent and defenseless living beings in these horrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would torture them for no reason, or just for money? I tell you, this director is either a mental retardation or a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. He really deserves to cut his hands and burn alive. <br /> <br /> It contains various horribly barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children: a real frog is flayed alive, fish sadistically mutilated and thrown into the water, a dog is beaten, birds are thrown in the water ... <br /> <br /> This film is more than terrible; it must be the worst and most delayed film ever made, as well as another film called "Cannibal Holocaust" or something like that. I will never watch and buy any film made by this heartless monster. No one should be wasting time looking at it, especially when there are a lot of REAL big movies, in which all scenes of animal abuse are staged. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few people liked this film - which is natural, because it's the worst film ever - so it was not a success. I hope this will make it clear to the delayed director that such barbaric, unjustified acts of extreme cruelty and violence towards real animals will NEVER be praised and that he will stage all scenes of animal abuse in his subsequent films. I really believe that everyone gets but what they give! There will be a day when all backward and cruel "humans" will feel the same pain they had inflicted on others. <br /> <br /> But that's probably my only negative comment. I usually do not comment on a movie if I do not like it, but this time I just could not shut up. I had to tell the truth because the abuse of animals had to stop!
