T. Rama Rao made some very fine films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who can not mature with changing times, styles and fashions. It's like stuck in the same style of old-fashioned movie. <br /> <br /> Actors are neither bad nor bad. Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly in both his father and son roles, but the flawed scenario often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she's always good and here she is. She makes the most of what is given to her, but she always does it. In conclusion, nothing big at all. Raveena is fine, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This film is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Well, even in this case, it would still be below the norm. The scenario is terrible, the film is excessive, and the story is not going anywhere. It's like being in a film from the early 1990s, but the screenplay makes it even older, the style is that of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend it unless you're a big fan. featured actors.
