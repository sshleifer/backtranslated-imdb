Under the dense green mass of computer graphics shone the amazing art and talent of Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas: he got lost in all the goo. The scenes of Old Edo - with the courtesan, drifting over the Sumida, repeating and playing in the Nakamura-za - were all exciting and engaging, bringing you back to a rich and interesting time. The action on the Kabuki scene, in which Somegoro excels and excites, has been more rewarding than the aberrant absurdities that followed. The skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets were much more satisfying than all the absurdities that invaded the plot and the performance. What a missed opportunity! One of the best kabuki players alive, and he gets lost in the dreck.
