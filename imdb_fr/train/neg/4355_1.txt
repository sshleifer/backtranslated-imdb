Horrible. I see many user comments on the quality of this show. It's really a Wanna-Be-Friends imitation - Made in Taiwan. The jokes are nil like ... and the plot is ridiculous. The actors obviously have a hard time being funny and are probably upset when they hit those terrible typing lines (if you can call them that). Most of the other users who commented obviously come from another planet (or at least from another continent). There are obviously reasons why television channels cancel programs ... and none of these reasons occur when programs are doing well. Have a sense? Anyway, avoid yourself - even if it's raining and there is absolutely nothing else to do on this planet ... will rather stay up in the rain - more fun.
