oh my god, I give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons. the final sequence is again very well managed and it was absolutely hilarious. that's why he gets these three points. Other than that, it was atrocious. it was not meant to be funny, it's obvious, but the dubbing, the doubling of voices, the dialogue they said were often hilarious. actions performed, and / or not performed also cause a lot of hilarity and / or throw things on the screen. as when the whole city is slaughtered and a small group of people stand on a balcony, looking as if they are looking at a baking glass, or the "attempts" of escape from the church in which they hid . <br /> <mal mayor: I think something is going on outside, so you should go up and look out the window. <br /> <br /> hero: ok. <br /> <br /> wrong mayor: it's now my chance to push an idiot outside and ignite, the fire being totally ineffective and being hacked. <br /> <br /> insert the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> The evil Mayor: damn, wait, I'll have this little child and she'll walk outside and cry apparently apparent pappa on the fact that these rotten corpses are not just spooky aliens but are actually zombies without flesh or skin or anything and it will lead them and I will flee them! insert the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> <br /> Hero (top): he tries to escape again, fool, and he left the door open, he's silly, it's a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> hero (down now): I do not know, I can not see her anyway and she was not outside because I could not see her despite her absence There and I, we have a view of the whole neighborhood and she just stands outside, where the heck could she be? <br /> <br /> needless to say someone would throw things on the screen after 10 minutes. So, watch the first movie with a few friends while having a few drinks and make sure that when you look at this one, you'll be completely drunk and can just laugh at stupidity. and there was not even a decent gore, such a shame.
