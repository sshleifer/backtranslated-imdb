Not to be confused with the supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". The Sentinel was a big film for me, not delivering coherent action, promised by a couple of critics. For me, it seemed to me that everyone was half-stunned, and only to make money fast, because it looked a lot like a movie made for television. The Sentinel is a synthesis of several more successful films, such as "In The Line Of Fire", which contains no originality. Seeing Michael Douglas run, was in my opinion a bit ridiculous. The main problem, besides its lack of originality, had to be the slow pace. I was often distracted by trying to watch this movie, while watching how much time was left, more than once. Not just the misunderstanding with Eva Longoria, who could not convince her to be licked. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is generally a reliable actor. He does not convince as a man on a race or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also interrupted. I am a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here it is only OK, nothing more. He tries to sound like a gruff, but manages to be more bland than anything else, and to be honest, he did not seem so interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince in her role, and was purely sweet. Kim Basinger is pretty terrible as a 1st lady. She seems to be bored to tears and her role is two fingers, more than anything else. Martin Donovan plays an important role at the end, but not enough to make it count for me. <br /> <br /> At the end of the line. The Sentinel is yet another political thriller that bores me to tears. It's too old, too tired, and especially the lack of effort sucked. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
