This show is probably the most awesome, ugliest, and most amazing steamboat I've ever seen in a successful children's program. The main character, Johnny, although I understand that he is supposed to represent an ordinary child, is not sympathetic or even tolerable. The jokes are lame, excessive (ie the gag "Whoa! I did not see it coming." Come on, it was not even funny the first time, it's not even cute) and lacks any form of spirit or primitive inspiration. And finally ... it's just ugly to watch. Although children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer to have their mouths in the eye. I can not stand watching the show, because in a way, the artistic style is just ... disgusting. Ugly, actually. Simply shabby. <br /> <br /> I just can not stand that it takes so much air time. Although I understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and that I should not hope to see her coming back ... I really miss the old caricatures. Bring Dexter's lab, The Powerpuff Girls ... something other than this shit. I guess it's just wishful thinking though. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, I advise you not to waste your time on this show. I believe that older children can also appreciate good designs. And that does not cut the game.
