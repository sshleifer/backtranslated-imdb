"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who are fighting for their rights since the beginning of Adam and Eve's loose-leaf system." When "Politics" was shot, the nineteenth amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote, was only ten years old. And the film deals with the fact that women hold political power as an electoral group. The defense of prohibition and closure of parliaments was a major concern of women at that time. <br /> <br /> The kind Marie Dressler (Hattie Burns) becomes politically active after the death of a young woman shot with a speakeasy. She wants the alcohol sales joints to be closed; and, is written in a mayoral race, after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally. Mrs. Dressler is supported by her tenants, her best friend Polly Moran (Ivy Higgins) and her stammering husband, Roscoe Ates (Peter Higgins). Dressler's race at Lake City mayor provokes opposition from men in town; So, Dressler orders the women to go on strike, forbidding them "everything" in the "living room, bedroom and bath". <br /> <br /> The movie sounds a lot better than it has been. Frankly, the humor is not very good; and, he presents some funny and moderately offensive situations ("You look like Mrs. Queen" refers to a character of Amos and Andy). And, the mix of filming and slapstick does not mix well, this time. Producers may have considered making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and characters played by William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7 / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran and Roscoe Ates
