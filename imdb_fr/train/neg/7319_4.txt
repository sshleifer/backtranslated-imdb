When you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to gag a ball of hair. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I saw most, if not all, of his films, but it was the first time I saw him. Modern Romance is an interesting interpretation of love. There are few films that treat the despair of love as well as openly as Modern Romance, although Chilly Scenes of Winter 1979 is very close. They both deal primarily with obsessed men who are too psychologically attracted / obsessed by their respective wives. <br /> <br /> Where-while Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on the subject of stalking, this film has a stronger foundation with the subject of love because the two people are already in a relationship .. and go out of the relationship .. and return to it again. <br /> <br /> And because it's a movie released in 1981, he is in his time in terms of styles and others. This is the main reason why I like this movie. My basic film rule is, "If it's at least fearful, it may be of historical interest," you know what you're doing in the time capsule. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to the terrible scenes of Albert Brooks without shirt. <br /> <br /> The man has the hair. Very hair. As if he was wearing a furry black sweater in curly fur. And what's worse is that he almost looks burned. It's not nice to see and the scenes with him without a shirt continue again and again. In the early 80's, hairy men were considered normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, the sight of something like this is simply disgusting. Sorry, Albert! I would have liked somebody to say "Hey, let's try this scene, but if you're wearing a simple t-shirt, I mean you could scare people." It's really bad and I'm sorry for the poor pretty actress who had to treat Albert Brooks' naked body over hers. She has probably torn her hair out of her teeth for days. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's an OK movie. It could have been better if I had not seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for 10 minutes that seemed long and continuous, as it would forever hurt my vision of this film.
