I could never stay watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in the movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard hunting scene!). Jodie Foster in her first "adult" role turns in her usual professional performance but that's no excuse for this boring clutter. Two hours of my life that I will never come back! No remarkable characters, an incredible scenario, a dubious editing and a terrible cinematography, but worst of all, I could not care less. The story of Californian teenagers of the 1970s, where children live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time looking at this ugly excuse for a movie.
