The words "swedish" and "action movie" do not mix. This becomes more and more evident with every attempt made in the genre. It is still an unsuccessful attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works in a military air base with highly secretive computer systems. One day, foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does not do what they say. They want the secret material and will do everything to get it. <br /> <br /> This film has its ups and downs. And generally, in Swedish action movies, there are no "highs", just "low" ones. So, I guess something in this movie has shown some quality. To start with the positive remarks, I can mention that the film is technically well done. The images of airplanes and helicopters in flight are well filmed and very pretty. The actors play is of very variable quality. Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long the Swedish filmmakers will continue to use it, even if it has the qualities of actress of a board of wood?). Stefan Sauk is laughable as a "cool" special forces man who goes to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> And what about action scenes? As I said above, scenes of airplanes and helicopters in flight are nice. But aside from that, there is not much action to discuss. And it's a problem common to Swedish action movies. There is simply not enough action. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's the film culture. I do not know, but it affects the experience. Frankly, the story and the acting are not enough for this film to stick to that. <br /> <br /> I evaluate this effort on 4/10.
