What have I just watched? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually pretty scary to see that there are a lot of people who are scared of clowns ... but the fact that it's a 300-pound rhyme reciting the killer clown pretends of the kind. I still wonder how the character of Mark could not escape the clown ... he weighs 300 pounds, he must end up getting tired. The whole end made me stand up and say literally aloud "What have I just watched?" Apparently, Brandon is Denise's cousin .... and they had it almost in the middle of the movie, which meant he had slept with his cousin ..... yeah that's something that people want, then see * shudder *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found hilarious stupid is the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says "what did you do?" Well, you think he just did what? The last thing that was stupidly funny was for a second, the main character slapped the hitchhiker and called her, then 5 minutes later, claiming that the violence was useless, the writer of the scenario a- did he give the line to the wrong guy? Anyway, none of these movies makes sense. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less a stupid little budget porn that I got carried away in the purchase (every 3.99) and that I had no entertainment outside the scenes of sex. I'm surprised that the big clown did not join the orgy, he has integrated well. I was hoping the movie would have entertainment value comparable to other B-movies, but I was wrong. It's a stupid trash that does not even deserve to be watched. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
