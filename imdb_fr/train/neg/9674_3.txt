This film reminds me of very bad sci-fi movies of the 50s and 60s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's dull, silly and stupid. The special effects are laughable, all the actors are ridiculous and the end is simply horrible. waste your money, rent or buy something better.I give it 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey pretty amusing because of its stupidity).
