Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie of all time. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without the heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and organ ... go!). The role is ... well, there is no game! <br /> <br /> There is a guy who goes to the woods to look for his missing wife and take the time to make love to a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a big fearless clown who could not get past a turtle! <br /> <br /> All cast members are stupid and the director effortlessly inserts all the slashers' shots into the movie. <br /> <br /> The end is the most stupid ever made. Think about it: the guy (Ken Hebert) who has the acting skills is pretty much the same as his writing (he's the mastermind behind this flop) invites a colleague and two of his friends into his cabin for the weekend. end and kill them. .. On Monday morning, he returns to his office without anything happening. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert tries to make us believe that it's a family affair that has lasted for generations (his uncle is the clown killer) <br /> < So, of course, NO policeman will question him after the disappearance of his co-worker ... <br /> <br /> THAT IT IS EVERYTHING. <br /> <br />
