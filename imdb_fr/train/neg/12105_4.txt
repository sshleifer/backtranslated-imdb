It was a disappointing film. People seem to have no substance, the main protagonist, Martin Cahil, has no redemptive value. In fact, everyone, including Jon Voight, embodies sleeze. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The violence is unpleasant, though cleverly made. The filming is black, at least the impression that I saw fit this category. Disappointment.
