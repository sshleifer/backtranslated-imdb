In general, I only comment on the films I like, saying "everyone to his liking", but I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which seems to be getting lost, is that these two egocentric adults have every right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, get married and inflict untold suffering on their respective children. the children. Even taking into account the drunkenness sanctioned by culture, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they started. After all, "love" is all that matters, is not it? To hell with all the others. Whether things "end up" or not, that's really not the question; in fact, it's totally out of place. The fact is that the lack of respect for others, especially if they are young, and especially if they are dependent, is lightened and therefore reinforced by this film. These "parents" could have adopted much more innocuous behaviors that would have killed an army of social workers on their heads in the blink of an eye.
