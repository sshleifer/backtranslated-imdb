Hey, <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try to do it about Leonard Cohen! This is filled with just enough of Leonard to anger the viewer who will wonder why they are listening to all these other singers (some dubious) speak for themselves. Puleeze ... seems to be reliving their high school diary - who cares about you, what about Leonard? Guess what people are doing, if you are doing something worthy, maybe someone will do a documentary about you. I found the U2 members' parade particularly insulting as if it would add credibility to this movie - NOT. Leonard does not need Bono or The Edge to talk about his spirituality. What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some of his spirituality through the film. Gee, what a concept! I'll give Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker some props for their Cohen song covers - the rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. you!
