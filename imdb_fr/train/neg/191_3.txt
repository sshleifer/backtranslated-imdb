... not to live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "A river crosses it" is certainly a film well done from the point of view of kinetics. Great landscapes, Redford doing good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all). <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is a character as arid and narrow as his father preacher. Driven without leading his own life, he is forced to look at his brother, who is also locked in a small town and loses his life. The author never even manages to understand his brother's motives, but at least realizes he does not miss him in the least. All he has to do is fly fishing, where he even follows the old man in the manner of his father. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it is predictable from the beginning. <br /> Definitely NOT a must (3/10) <br /> <br />
