Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a rather strange idea and does not make much effort to draw a story from it. By and large, No. 4 Alice is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy, giving her an outlet for haunting her friends. There are the least deaths in the series and the wise failures are pretty poor, so neither horror nor comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I do not have much to say about it. It's pretty interesting to see Alice and Dan's characters go back four years, but it's not worth watching a movie. Without enthusiasm and joy, only the competing direction preserves the worst series.
