A-beeping-believable! Meg Ryan does not even look like her usual adorable personality, which makes me forgive her shy and agitated cat. Hard to believe she was the producer of this dog. More Kevin Kline: What kind of suicide trip was his career? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Finally, was this done by the guy who made Big Chill? Must be a cover of Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
