Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what he would do with total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it's unassailable, but not because the jokes are not funny - some (I would not say most of them), and in fact, Mr. Mike did well to translate his mentally unbalanced clefts into visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (scenery, lighting, sound, editing, etc.) is so horrible that the film is intolerable. A group called "PKO Productions" gets the production credit, but it does not seem to be produced at all. it looks like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and did it in one afternoon. I realize that Mike's goal was to torture the public, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to see, hear or understand everything that is supposed to be shocking. Nevertheless, the DVD is not a total waste: it includes a eulogy for Bill Murray's O'Donoghue and three "Mike's Loved Mike's Stories" from SNL. Plus, the "Cat Swim" section of the movie is a fantastic scene to watch if you want to make someone flip. 3/10
