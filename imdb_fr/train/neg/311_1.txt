I just watched Going Overboard. I must say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and have it watched. I even tried to make this blind woman look and she turned it off after 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for writing, if that's what you want to call, the makers should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I think I read somewhere that the budget for this film was $ 10,000 and they were much lower. Has Wallmart done a good job on this? Every store has a huge trash of that shit sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster, or exchange it to a friend, but they might not be your friend anymore !!
