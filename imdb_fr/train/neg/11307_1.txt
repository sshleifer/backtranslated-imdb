The perfectly stupid weapon. I think the guys who were dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal's movies intended to make fun of Jeff doing his dance form at the beginning of this silly movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were fair and Jeff acts as well as the couch that he beats with some kind of weapon in a scene.
