*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** With its opening credits, this fantastic film restores the facts: it's an instant classic. It does not take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7". His greatness left me speechless as I left the cinema and went straight to the ticket office, to buy me a dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a film that simply requires several views. The first viewing will surely leave you with this strange "Huh?" feel, but not feel embarrassed - this happens to the best of us. The story is so cleverly devilish that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI turns out to be an allegorical story that works on many levels and teaches us everything about the really important things in life. The complexity of the structure of the plot will disconcert you during your first visit, but do not give up! It was not until my sixth or seventh visit that I began to solve only some of the hidden mysteries of Corky Romano. And watch the unexpected ending at the end, otherwise you might be caught off guard when it is revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is the most wanted FBI criminal, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. Surprised, I can tell you more. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comedic talents are second to none as he trains his character, Corky Romano, into a labyrinth of totally unpredictable situations. Recalling John Reynolds' performance in "Manos, the hands of fate", Kattan has multiple personalities and approaches all scenes with perfect comic timing. However, Kattan is not just a comedy. He is also a master of the drama, because he controls the feelings of the public with the least movements of his face. Her facial expressions somehow reflect life itself. For example, in the scene where he fartes the faces of his brothers, you can see that the expression of social injustice and alienation is clearly reflected on his anguished face. At such a moment, it is difficult to find a dry eye in the house. <br /> <br /> Writers David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of "Corky Romano". With a story of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to carry out this ambitious project. Their skilful narration and unorthodox structure make Pulp Fiction a skimpy Saturday Night Live sketch. The story of Garret and Ward is so fascinating and attractive that it grabs you by the hair, engulfs you completely, shakes you and makes you spit on it. At the end of this experience nicknamed "Corky Romano", you find yourself face to face with worldviews and different ideas, and with one question in mind: <br /> <br /> Why, God? Why?!?
