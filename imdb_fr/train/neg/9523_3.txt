The plot of this movie is not strong at all, a lot of holes. If you approach the film like a car, it's not bad, there are many good cars in this one. The reason I love it is that I come from the area where it was shot. I take a lot of fun to look at the recognizable spots of St. Cloud, MN, and see how the city has changed since 89. This is an interesting historical piece for us locals. Looks like every time a movie is shot here, everyone wants to have a relationship with him. It is impossible to find a copy in one of the local video stores, as they were all stolen once on VHS. I had to get a copy of Japan on Ebay and I found it interesting to see how the drag race was taking place all over the city. I did not know that the director was from St.Cloud.
