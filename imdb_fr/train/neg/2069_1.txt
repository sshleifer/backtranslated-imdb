I went to see it at Esquire Theater in Cincy, Ohio, and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would have been a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> As it was a painful film, but to see Bret Carr in person, was to see despair at its peak. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie was to see BC slamming in the face with what appeared to be a "C" battery. The jury is always about it. It was from a dildo and it was slow motion. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Only shoot on the left side of the face ... people become famous by demanding things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr donned a chicken costume for a bit of reverse psychology, wandering the streets of Clifton by hitting his own movie. He should. It's ok to criticize the film. <br /> <br /> My soul felt irritated after this movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult, nor smart enough for that matter. This is the feeling that you feel in the movie What the Bleepesque of impressionable neo-yuppies who have been brainwashed and who came to see this piece of work by Bret Carr. <br /> <br /> It's an emotionally exhausting experience just thinking about writing about this movie, bye-bye. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
