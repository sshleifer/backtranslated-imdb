It was so bad. On an equal footing with (thankfully!) The short-lived "Dirty Dozen" television series that featured Ben Murphy and was made about the same time (also discounted in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed for the members of the cast of this movie - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was too old waaaaaay and too big for the role (he was pushing at 70 when he made that trash), and the critic who draws parallels with Telly the Greek and John Wayne in "The Green Berets" sums it up quite nicely. <BR /> <br /> Other critics have pointed to some of the many derisory yells contained in this crime against celluloid. I will not repeat them here. But I will add that I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny helmet that Savalas wears on his big bloated head. <br /> <br /> I'm also amazed that this movie wreck has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a "1" right across the board. If you want a good example of why searching a franchise to death is really a bad idea (especially more than 20 years after the original), look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Horrible - to avoid !!!!
