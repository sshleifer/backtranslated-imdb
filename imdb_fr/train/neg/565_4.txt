The same difficulty that I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" also applies to "Oliver". Instead of writing composers in the stylistic period of the staging, they were content to write Broadway-style melodies, historically unidiomatic and asymmetric stylistically. <br /> <br /> do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties that permeate the score. It is an uncomfortable mixture that leaves a deliciously acidulous impression. <br /> <br /> The cast of the boy Oliver does not help: shy timbre attempt and valuable value, there is nothing less than solid here. Fagin correctly performs his traditional routine, although the tunes he is forced to sing have little foundation in the old fashioned way. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me" receives a strident, throaty and tense interpretation. The two major production numbers, "Who Will Buy" and "Consider You" seem over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink. It's one thing to do everything, another to go beyond the limits. <br /> <br /> The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel do not seem to lend themselves to such projects and such a choreography. Although the novel is considered a classic, I must admit that I have problems with the conscience of Mr. Dickens, because his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his personal life without joy, full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> The combined talent of this production, whether in front of a camera or under a camera, does not make it possible to overcome the non-constructive nature of the basic material. All this translates into an unpleasant experience for me. <br /> <br />
