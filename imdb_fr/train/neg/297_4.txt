For the record, this film is intriguing but not very original. In 1998, a film starring Talia Shire, The Landlady, had almost exactly the same plot of land, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story is such that Amanda Lear had a bad life, a violent father, an exciting doctor, psychiatric homes, etc. She is finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her wicked doctor ... to whom she abuses and kills the poor guy. (Now, it was original) The doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard. After moving in, she falls in love with a stud named Richard, who is married to a blues singer. If you've seen the owner, you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill everyone between her and Richard (including a roadie). <br /> <br /> Much of the idea comes from the previous movie, The same foolish sidekick who puts his nose in, the same spying of the guy with a bowl of popcorn, even while stealing a body-press . There was original material, the bottle of beer was brutal. The highlight of the movie was the beauty of Amanda's breasts in the hot-top scene. A bit of a scam but not a total loss of time. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
