About the baby: Why did not Big Brother think he would be hungry for a baby bottle, food or diaper? He should have shouted constantly after so many hours without care. Absolutely stupid to take the baby to a safe place when he did not need it. <br /> <br /> And why was the road miraculously cleared whenever someone wanted to drive somewhere? Have uprooted trees not fallen on the roads and blocked them? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that the police at the roadblock do not immediately follow a young person who crushed him, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> That said, it was good to have a movie that kids could watch safely, to change.
