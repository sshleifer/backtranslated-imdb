If he wanted to be precise, he should have chosen Frisco natives and not a group of New York actors who know nothing about Sucka Free (no Sucker Free). I have lived all my life at SF and the people here do not speak and do not play the role of these actors. Everything was over-dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. No surprise he's the only one in the movie to dress like a cat here (ie his Warriors jersey). I did not notice once that someone was wearing a Giants or 9ers gear; instead, he put them in lean SF or Oakland jerseys, which are not even sold here. HP does not have a bowling alley, black and Asian gangs do NOT wear head or bracelets in the colors of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team, any more than all Chinese gangsters wear a Yao Ming jersey and try to ring in black while shooting. In addition, although a large community of yuppies has invaded the mission, only one white type and a self-proclaimed "100% Boreal West Coast" have been shown. It's not New York! The Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Mission Latinos are very, very different from the ONE shown here, which was undoubtedly from New York. In addition, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. An accurate representation would have shown the drama between the HP sets in their own hood as well as against Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better if Lee had done more homework and had a better story to work with.
