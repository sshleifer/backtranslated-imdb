After life was a miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these movies were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of silly antics without history. Underground's wild and unbridled humor seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. It seems that Kusturica has been in free fall since he started producing comedies to improve life, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which, in my opinion, was great, but already had worrying signs of dementia . I liked his first films so much and that's why it's particularly disappointing to see something like this. Hope his next will be great.
