To see how bad The Shield is, you would have to write pages and pages. So just say it's a monument to the wrong direction. <br /> <br /> "When Directors Go Awry" should have been the title of this production. Indeed, the directors are supposed to infuse in their work a visual style and a narration that propels the story. <br /> <br /> How is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom a "style"? How does this propel history? Of course, there is also nonsense "Random Number Editing". Apparently, it became a hip to just cut randomly. <br /> <br /> I guess it's too much work to do a good editing. <br /> <br /> Well, it's too much work for most people to watch The Shield languishing as one of the most over-excited and unsupervised shows of all time.
