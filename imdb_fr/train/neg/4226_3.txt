Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) is. I had heard the rumors, read the reviews - but I had to decide. Well, let me tell you - it's blowing !!! The worst film of all the films, the dubbing that had to be done while all the people involved was completely spoiled, inept and laughable gore FX, no discernable storyline, "cinematography" that looks like my grandmother filmed with her camcorder, gun accessories no joke - made of aluminum foil - the list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three men get stuck on an island where a gang of Strange walks around with plastic swords and tin foil. Two of the captives are released with a rebel of monsters on the island and have a day ahead before being chased by the rest of the "tribe" ... that's about all ... <br /> < Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune to submit too. The budget was to be around $ 200 and was fully spent on the FX gore (which may not have been a bad idea ...). ZOMBIE DOOM has nothing but ridiculous gory scenes with many dialogues nicknamed HORRIBLY. This film makes look like other exits without budget like PREMUTOS: LORD OF LIVING DEAD to TITANIC. Some people can put ZD in the category "too bad, that's fine" - and I guess if you're REALLY drunk or very loud and you're looking at it with some friends at the MST3K - I guess that might be considered this way. But not by me. I hated just about everything related to it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is just as appalling and included as a "bonus" on ZD's release from Shock-O-Rama) is revealing of Andreas Schnaas' other works - then he should be banned from any activity . to make a film on pain of death. There's a funny battle of kung fu in the second half of the movie and a lot of blood - so I'll give this one a VERY generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip this.
