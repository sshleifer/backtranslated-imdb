I understand that this film is made for children and as a parent, I have watched many films that are not particularly close to my heart, but I appreciate from a constructive point of view how it is received by my children. After all, parents are supposed to be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and to watch the quality of the entertainment they watch. So there should be something that will appeal to an adult audience on some level, even in children's movies. Disney has always understood that, and that's why it's so difficult to understand how it could allow such a complete drek piece to bear its name. doubled and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was awful since the dialogue itself seemed to have been written by a 12 year old for a school project. The "game" reminded me of a play at school and none of the child actors had a range of emotions in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short movie. <br /> <br /> Now, before leaving as a video geek measuring a children's movie with an adult garden stick, the only thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message. Far be it from me to determine how a message should be transmitted as long as the message is correct. Let's go through this movie to see what messages are being given: <br /> <br /> If you are lost, do not worry, you will inevitably make your way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wild animals without any fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any contest simply because you "know" that you can do it. <br /> <br /> and my favorite, the last message left in the movie: <br /> <br /> It's normal to disobey authoritative personalities and do what you think is right.
