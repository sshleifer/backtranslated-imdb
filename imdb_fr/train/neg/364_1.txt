Larry Buchanan. Yes, the same guy who did "The Eye Creatures Attack" and two conspiracy movies (count them: TWO) on Marilyn Monroe. He is to blame here. <br /> <br /> Adding to his ever-growing pile of files left by Oliver Stone's "eh-Ia-grown-out-of-himself" plot drawer, here is "Down On Us" ie "Beyond the Gates"), which is the definition of historical inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you thought you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, aka Big Lar 'because here is the Y'see, the three big names of rock of the 60s were murdered by the government because they were subversive or counter-productive for Truth, Justice and the American way, or they have sumpthin' like that, I knew it all. <br /> <br /> Anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who strangely resemble their real shadows (ie, if you close your eyes completely, turn your back and walk five miles away) to show that, instead of their recorded deaths, the good old USA of A have been killed! Yes, that's the truth! <br /> <br /> I can not believe I watched this movie. str The credibility of etching at the breaking point is ridiculous; the game gives the impression that television commercials look like dramas and if you honestly look at them until the end, you deserve the end "twist". You do it really, really; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But as the man said: "Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll." <br /> <br /> This is not this movie. <br /> <br /> No stars for "Down on Us". And it's the audience of the film that describes the film, by the way ...
