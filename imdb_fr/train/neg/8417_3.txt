I anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the Broadway play. I waited and read reviews for months on award-winning performances. I mean with the power of Eddie Murphy's star, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie could not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, is not it? FALSE! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not match the hype he was the subject of and the only saving grace was Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque's performance saves the film at the same time Jennifer Hudson's multiple lulls and performance compels you to be careful every time she's on screen. His performance of "And I tell you" is the only time I felt that the hype was deserved. You broke down when she begged no good man to let her stay in the group and in her life. As many critics have said, she steals the film from more experienced actors and deserves all the congratulations she receives for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with great voice and comic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, sailed in their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate her extraordinary rendition of "Ray," and Beyonce Knowles was taking part in a fashion photo shoot or long video recordings, posing and projecting through the film. His performance was not strong enough to interest you in his character at any point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was too fashionable, 30 minutes and 1 song (the solo "heart" Beyonce to Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
