The movie was horrible !!! Without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in recent years. One of those movies that I can tell people for three years is the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me an answer to this burning question "What is the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine prophecy. Believe me ... I read the book, I enjoyed the message and I was looking forward to seeing the movie, but then they treated the audience as if we were delayed. There is no story and the story is paralyzed by too much magic and coincidence. It is unfortunate that they have to spell the nine prophecies and they can not incorporate them into a fun story to follow. They did not spend time developing their characters and it was easy not to worry about the death of one of their characters. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people to stay until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is quite boring too, but I enjoyed the parallels you could see in everyday life as you read the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not to see it if you want to keep the words of the book close to your heart. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. Believe me.
