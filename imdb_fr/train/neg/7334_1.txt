I consider Stuart Bliss as the worst film I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting game was terrible and the plot ridiculous. I understand the fact that the main character's wife who left him triggered a mental collapse, but it became so ridiculous and boring that after a while I could worry less about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The film continued. again and again the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot. The problem with the Geiger counter was too late after Stuart started opening his wall to see what was behind, after the counter indicated there was something. <br /> <br /> Then there were the repetitive scenes with the flyer, and the disconcerting where he meets. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed that this movie was a fiasco when I did not recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie arrives, read a book! You will be better.
