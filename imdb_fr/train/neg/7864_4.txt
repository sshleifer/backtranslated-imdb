The Hills Have Eyes II is what you expect from him and nothing more. Of course, it will not be an Oscar-nominated film, but pure entertainment in which you can lose yourself for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially about a group of National Guard trainees who are fighting against the mutant notables of the mutated hills on their last day of training in the desert. It's just them who fight all the way through the film, which includes a lot of violence (which is essentially the whole movie) because blood and guts constantly fly throughout the film, as well as another rape graphic scene which is unnecessarily thrown to shock the public. <br /> <br /> I would give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. Even though, at that moment, I found myself watching my watch more and more as the film progressed, as the film started to drag out because it was still trying to shock the audience with a graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just a decent entertainment, enough to pass the time if you are bored and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
