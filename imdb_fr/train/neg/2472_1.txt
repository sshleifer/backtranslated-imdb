Anyone who has actually had the ability to sit in this movie and go away feeling like it's a good movie does not appreciate quality movies. This film was an insult to watch, the direction was the quality of the high school cinema class as well as the cinematography. Blair's witch project had better cinematography and I hate this movement with passion! The scenario had the potential to be a very good, very intense film, but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes until the end of the film. Someone mentioned that this movie was about a child's imagination, all right, all right. But they could have done better with this script than they did. I mean, come on, Indian in the store. Has the child looked at the little idol and suddenly imagined the Indian and the whole story of an Indian spirit called Wendigo? What they mention to the store employee and she mentions that there is none other than me working here, so you think it's going to be a scary ghost scenario, but then she's content to pay for the idol amount and we forget the little kid who sees this guy. It was so lame that it goes beyond pathetic. The end let you ask not only what happened to Otis at the hospital, but also with the feeling of OMG !!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this !! It is a gesture that I recommend NOT to watch, there are certainly better quality movies that will not insult your intelligence! Thank goodness, I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have asked for my money! For those who have been easily entertained by this movie .... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of film making by saying that it was a good movie.
