*** Spoilers possible from the plot *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I wonder why he accepted the role of police detective in The Spreading Ground in 2000. This film is absolutely nil and I will tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is a small town about to sign a contract for a sports stadium. A hitch: there is a killer on the run and it's bad for business. The mayor makes an agreement with the Irish crowd to find the murderer and ensure that he will never reach the courts. Det. Ed Delongpre has other projects. He wants this guy to be caught too, but he is level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system doing its job. <br /> <br /> It could have been very good. It could have been fascinating. It was horrible. First of all, they call this type of Serial Killer. Uh no There are specific criteria and none of them is suitable here. The villain killed 5 children on the first day and I think it was the second day. This whole film extends like a period of 48 hours ... Action barely serious. I do not care what distorted patterns they give him at the end. Serial Killers take a long time. They do not suddenly kill 7 children in two days. It's a Spree. <br /> <br /> Okay, this irritating aside, the acting was awful. The only name here was Hopper, and he's the only one to be about to take his part. Unfortunately, he is a bit typical for me and I think he is much better, much better. It just was not a good vehicle for Hopper. This did not allow him to do what he did best, namely to act in a frightening way. It's not that he acted badly, it's that I've seen him do so much better. <br /> <br /> The Irish guy from the crowd, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - The Long Day at Night), which is their investigation is a bit exaggerated. Contradiction? Not really. He tries to play the cold and hard guy, and he does it to the point that the character is just wood. Boring to the fullest. He did not scare me. He did not inspire emotion except boredom. I can not tell you how many times I have checked how long it was until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing about this is that it looked like a movie made for television. . You know what I mean. Poor production values, low budget, reuse of scenes to reduce costs. Just huh. Yanno? But I feel that comparing that to those is an insult to those. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both the director and the filmmaker of the project. He bit more than he could chew. I can not help thinking that Hopper had to take this role as a personal favor to a friend. This is the only rational I can find. This was Vanlint's first job as director and the third position as director of photography. Hope this is a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the end if you decide to torture yourself with this one, but I want to say that they all fell. .. little Hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally heartbreaking for the detective, it was just ... well ... blah. I did not see anything of the anxiety that would accompany the total shifting that this guy did. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> These 100 exhausting minutes and rated R for violence and language. No child under 13 will be interested in this, so do not worry. It does not suit anyone anyway. heh. <br /> <br /> Jump this one. You'll thank me later.
