First of all, this plot is very exaggerated - a girl wants to do it, everyone loves it, a snobbish girl comes in, everything looks lost, the girl does it, everyone loves her new, etc. heroin, plus single-parent annoyances and it's so predictable that you can practically recite with her. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate the way they continue to dissolve classical music. They send the message that all those involved in classical music are stuck, snubbed and close-minded - in fact, I do not remember exactly the quote, but I remember at one point in the film, Holly has says, "Why did they get so stuck ... so classic?" It's really insulting that classical music labels are this way. <br /> <br /> Third, I've done dozens of times, but the only reason I can think of doing this film is to promote Britney Spears. <br /> <br /> And oh yeah, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure if she really was singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, it was not that amazing that they thought so - especially when she was singing. She has borne too much all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
