I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people sit down and look at this garbage ?? OK, my dad and my mom love it but I make sure I get out of the room before it happens. It's so depressing and dreary, but the worst part is that I do not support all detective programs like this because the detectives are really wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programs with a real mystery ??? I mean who wants to know what happened to the fictional characters we do not know who died more than 20 years ago ??? I hope the BBC will put more comedy on bbc1 because now, with the priest of Dibley, there is more room for shit like this.
