Let's be honest here: the only reason someone bought this, the only reason someone revised it, and the only reason someone could claim to like it is because David Lynch did it and because you want to have David Lynch's kids. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce shit. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience nonsense in itself as a pure subject of knowledge. Perhaps the atrocious, cacophonist and visual sounds to scratch are supposed to indicate something about the place of humanity in the world, about our relationship to reality, about the absurdity of it all. <br /> <br /> tell me one thing: I just lost 20 dollars. <br /> <br /> If I wanted an offensive offensive, I could throw Hansen up and let my ears bleed. If I wanted absurd for the absurd, I could just dump on a plate and watch it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a unique quality that buys Dumbland - it's meta, funny meta. . It's so bad that it's not even funny because it's so bad. This fact is a bit funny though. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. Otherwise, save yourself the agony.
