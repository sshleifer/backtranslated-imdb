It's done in 2007 and the CG is bad for a movie made in 1998. At one part of the movie, there is a dinosaur stop motion movie that looks really good, but it just makes the work extremely amateurish on the CG kind even worse. <br /> <br /> The writing, the acting, the staging and all the rest of this film are terrible. It's as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure shit! Once again, as in other films, the only frightening part about this movie is that it was made and is now on the science fiction channel. <br /> <br /> I still do not understand how they can get people who have acting skills to play in these movies and incite them to act as terribly as everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not sure, the other poster is obviously sarcastic in its criticism ... or it is one of the people who worked on this film.
