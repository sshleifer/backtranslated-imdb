This is one of the worst things England has ever known, so it says a lot. The tension when we have to know if Lembach stays or not is amazing. The good side sees the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic-print underwear after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This film also has several views of London although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident that brings your heart rate to a lower level than normal. There is also a watch that teleports, and the fear that the woman does not recover is parallel to the horror of "The Sixth Sense", but much duller and British. Add to that a furious brawl between the British police and Dr. Rat, who gives nothing, without electrocuting many people, plus a cat and you yourself ... uh ... a British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good but is not one of the best.
