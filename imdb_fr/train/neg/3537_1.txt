Convince the world that it did not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that many people probably remember. This comes from The Usual Suspects, of course, in relation to Kaiser Gold..I mean Sose .. <br /> <br /> I have another one like this: -The biggest thing ever done by a director was to try to convince an audience that he had a screenplay - <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the saddest filming projects I've seen in a long time. It starts so well, with a really fantastic cinematography, an excellent acting and a very smart place. But alas, the only direction of this film is to self-destruct. And that, not by a single blow, but by small cuts on the wrist. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here that are surprising because they have found a way to explain this donut. With enough alcohol in my brain, I would probably be able to explain the very existence of humanity in a very plausible way. I have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways of explaining history. And they vary from a story totally embedded in the head of someone playing chess with himself in a sneaky way for a criminal to play his enemies in chess-like ways. <br /> <br /> And all that is funny. But at the same time, it is painful to see that there is something wrong with this story. And apart from that, it is in any case a real scam in twenty films and books such as "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. We are not dealing with a loan here, it's a flagrant theft. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this film is that the story goes around in circles as if it were stuffed with If this film was a roller coaster, you would have crashed the attraction next to it after takeoff.There are so many twists and turns in this film that will never be solved a cocktail, you would need a bucket of life at the base to eliminate nausea after drinking, nothing is ever explained and when you finally understand the direction you are thinking of going, you find yourself caught in a other. <br /> <br /> I guess this story was not going anywhere on paper and Ritchy He must have thought it was great to make a movie, anyway, be the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or totally violate one's own work (Ritchy: seek the help of a professional). What could easily have been a jewel becomes an artificial art, a food for pseudo-intellectuals on which to debate Sunday afternoon discussion clubs. <br /> <br /> Spare your soul and your stomach, avoid at all costs!
