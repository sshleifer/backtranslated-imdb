This week, I just thought it would be fun to catch Corey Haim, after watching the two Lost Boys movies last week. Not that I'm a fan-boy - not far away - but I liked these two Coreys in some movies in my early teens. <br /> <br /> So I prepared for three movies starring him. Unfortunately, I chose "Dream Machine" as a first (I had never seen it before), and it was so awful that I decided to close Corey in my closet and let him deflate first his . But first I managed to make my way through this movie. I felt like he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), but I let myself take his own illusions. Virtually all the film wants to be a comedy and near the end, it is desperately trying to be a thriller. The only good thing about "Dream Machine" is the premise: a corpse in the trunk of a Porsche. Everything else fails so much that it's embarrassing. Even the most for Haim. I can believe it by being young, enthusiastic, but at least when it comes with some kind of directional direction. This was clearly not the case in "Dream Machine". So we have a perfect car, yes, this black Porsche. The perfect girlfriend of Haim? Just a blonde girl who has almost no lines in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? A guy who falls flat like the movie's villain, trying to steal everything in the trunk, never really succeeds, and at the end of the movie thinks he's Michael Myers (minus Shatner's white William Mask) and confuses Corey Haim with Jamie Lee Curtis. Do not think they could have made this movie if they tried. A stupid film without history with a story that leads nowhere and is directed by a director who does not know how to direct his casting. Excellent achievement! <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: Who had the idea to make you smile directly in the camera of the last filming of the film? To you or the director? So not done.
