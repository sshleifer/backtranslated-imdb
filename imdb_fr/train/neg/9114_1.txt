Because "cruel" would be the only word that exists to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you go? For starters, I'll start with the terrible acting of almost everyone in this movie. Scratch it. Almost does not belong to this sentence. I can not even think of a single character that has been well described. Although, in all fairness, it would be almost impossible to successfully portray these zero-dimensional characters. Yet, the girl who played Katherine (whose name does not appear deliberately - I pretend she did not exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian . The story was horrible. He tried to reflect the brilliance of the first but failed in many ways. Almost all parts of it were useless - though I admit (reluctantly) that the plot was pretty good to his surprise. And the end was at least slightly humorous. But this movie is the worst I have ever seen. Do not look at him. Just do not. There is absolutely no value in watching it. No. This only removes the enjoyment of the first.
