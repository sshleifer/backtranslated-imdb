There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon entitled "Baby Buggy Bunny" which was exactly this plot. Finster's baby face robbed a bank and the money in the car rolled over and fell into Bug's burrow burrow. He disguised himself as a baby to enter Bugg's hole to recover the money. The scene in "Little Man" where he looks in the mirror of the bathroom shaving with a cigar in his mouth comes directly from the cartoon. It was a cartoon of 5 minutes; not so much a whole movie. If this really interests you, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original the first time (1954). Plus, you'll have a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons!
