This film has its share of negative comments and I agree with those who consider it one of the worst films ever made. Of course, most of the films based on King's works are rather bad, but this one goes beyond the realm of horrors. There is not a single moment that is scary unless you consider a frightening stupidity. It's actually King's riddles - twisted myths that make no sense in the first place, mixed with so-called "frights" obvious and sophisticated that are as shocking as the PeeWee's Playhouse (at least, fun). It's full of ridiculous moments, of which the character of Alice Krige is not the least. When she goes wild and begins to whistle like the bad guy in an old Batman TV show, it's so absurd to be disgusting. Anyone who had cameos in this field (including John Landis) are lucky to still have a career. But the most absurd part must be the late-night cat suits, which look like cheap rubber suits bought from K-mart. The best part of the film is the appearance of real cats that surpass the characters of the film.
