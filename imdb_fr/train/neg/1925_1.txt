Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming and teaches a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this film, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative and egocentric whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault. I guess the script called the meanest person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is the magic of the movie. Just like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so totally unimaginable that any degree of comedy that could be drawn from his character simply evaporates. The caricature of 1966 described a Grinch to which we could all identify, Carrey's Grinch is that angry and soulless old man we all saw at one time or another, sitting in a parked car mumbling for himself or doing stumble toddlers his cane. This Grinch is completely devoid of humanity, humor or insight, and his redemption at the end of the film sounds wrong. The whole movie sounds wrong: there is a stupid Christmas lighting competition, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why Grinch is such a jolt while digging in his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery that explains why some people who have this strange extension of the lip and others of them not. Unlike the 1966 drawings, I imagine that children would find this film boring, irritating and filled with conflicting messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his parents without talent. Add the necessary jokes, pet jokes, sexual jokes and other obligatory Carreyesque humor, and you have a film as far removed from the 1966 cartoon (or the book that inspired it) as George's W. Bush rational and lucid thought. Congratulations to this big turkey.
