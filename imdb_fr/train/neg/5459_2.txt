It was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" shows in 1971. The episode featured Sue Lyon (from the fame of the movie Lolita) and Joseph Campanella, who respectively play a baby-girl. sitter and a vampire. The vampire hires a babysitter to watch his child (who appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night to get blood. The babysitter is totally unaware of the vampire's appearance when she sees him for the first time and starts to put two by two when she realizes he has no reflection in the mirror, that she has a strange collection of books in the occult library, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought she was. She locks herself by the door, the vampire comes out, looks puzzled and the episode is over. I do not know what it was like to make such an abbreviated episode that lasts only 5 minutes. They should have just widened the previous episode of these 5 minutes and ignore this one. A total effort wasted.
