Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it was not worth it. I guess it's a bad footprint and it's in the public domain. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite her fame, rewards and reputation - is a young British girl who can not sing, dance or actor. <br /> <br /> Some of the good and old Hollywood actors featured here must have thought they were doing a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought that Anna was the most exciting and talented woman on the screen. He was wrong. She was improbably popular in Britain before and after the Second World War. His "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than his musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only some of the famous songs are included and none of them are well presented. Skip this one and find the one featuring Doris Day. At least you'll have real comedy and a professional style dance!
