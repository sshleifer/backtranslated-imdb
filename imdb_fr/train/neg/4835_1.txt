Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel to a young American corporal in Afghanistan. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and circulates freely around Kabul, operating on wounded NATO soldiers. In a particularly difficult mission, he takes a sniper rifle and fires at Osama Bin Laden at a distance of about 3,000 meters. He was eventually promoted to the rank of sergeant, but was unable to choose between a career as a sniper and a career as a surgeon. He leaves the army completely. A year later, frustrated by civilian life, he joined the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly dressed in a white uniform.
