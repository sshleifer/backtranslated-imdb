"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" was a disappointment. I was told it was a kind of "Japanese version of the matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The film was either dubbed or the soundtrack was not up to scratch. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty bad. The English version of this film has been very little studied and appealed only to the genre "crazy". This is not a film that I would like to see again.
