Williamson's accent is hard to understand. He speaks incredibly quickly, as if he is in a hurry to cross the lines. During the monologues, he acts as if he is talking to someone when he is supposed to talk to himself. All this and his bald spot just bored me. He was too old for this role. Reading Williamson's other stories, he may have gotten that role because he was crazy and the director decided to play a bit of art-mimicking life or acting forcibly. When actors say that Hamlet is crazy, you believe it! Marianne Faithful is a breathtaking beauty that could miss the role of Ophelia and still get a pass. The decor is dark and scary, but it looks like it was shot in a real castle, especially in the corridors in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a big light in the sky.
