You remember the movie Spice Girls and the seriousness of the situation (apart from the songs), and their manager, Simon Fuller (also the manager of this group), made the same mistake by placing S Club (another of my favorite bands) in their own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically ask their boss to take a break, then see on TV! Three of them exchange, and vice versa, half discover that they are clones made by an avid scientist, and the other half has just got into trouble. Also featuring Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This movie may be more intriguing than the Spice Girls movie, but apart from the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin '" and "Never Had A True Dream Come", this is not a good reason to see this movie. Shortly after the separation of the group for good. Adequate!
