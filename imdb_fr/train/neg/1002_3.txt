I do not want to go into too much detail, because I can not really justify wasting a lot of time reviewing this film, but I had to give another opinion to help people avoid the film. The animation is raw and the story alternates between boring / useless to extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost to the audience, and yes - the Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT a science fiction action or anything like that - it's a zany comedy attempt, and the Humor just did not work after being translated. It was a total chore to watch this movie and a horrible way for me to start the film festival, especially considering my enthusiasm and openness to everything I did, I did not expect a sequel to Ghost in the Shell was expecting something fun, and that just did not work. Yaaawwnnn ... Hire Kino's Journey instead.
