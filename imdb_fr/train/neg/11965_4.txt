As a history man who is particularly interested in this historic event, I was very disappointed with the film. Admittedly, the costumes and the staging were quite authentic, but the Hollywood portrait of this "British raven" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of film footage devoted to troops on the march or in a parade must be unprecedented. in the history of the film. Eveytime, I heard the triumphant background music begin, I knew I had to prepare for another laborious stage of insignificant filling. Obviously, the producers had invested heavily in "staging" and were determined to get value for money. <br /> <br /> Despite an exceptional cast, their dialogue was, again, boring and their characters never developed. Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I shivered with disappointment. Their lines were so weak and so insignificant that I could hardly believe that they were the same two great actors who respectively represented Lawrence of Arabia and the bird-man of Alcatraz. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this one is not much better.
