In 1941, Columbia was a full-fledged full-fledged studio and could produce a film with the same technical varnish as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing that can be said about Adam Had Four Sons, a lead drama with almost no-frills performances by Ingrid Bergman (first time in American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchwoman (at the time when Hollywood thought that a foreign accent was worth as much as any other) had been hired as the governess of Baxter's four sons and remained in place (with an interruption caused by the stock market crash of 1907 ) until boys are grown men serving in the First World War. Just about everyone in the movie is so good, it's a relief when Susan Hayward as the nasty comes in halfway ?? she is pretty much the only watcher in the movie even though she clearly channels Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it is also the first of its long succession of alcoholic roles ?? but the script remains saccharine and the end is completely absurd. It is not surprising that Bergman rejected four years later the "Valley of the decision" drawn in the same way.
