Burt Kennedy was a very good manager, but you would never know because of this mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it is also cheap - most battle scenes are from "The Last Command", a much larger movie dating back to 1955, and this sequence, shot on years earlier, has a more contemporary appearance than this image. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confusing and incompetent, they look as thin as the rest of the picture. It sounds like a bad student movie (and the budget did not seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, usually ham is too high or at least comatose - even if Raul Julia is better than most other actors - and it's full of annoying historical inaccuracies . On top of that, it's way too long. If you want to make a boring movie, do it in about an hour and finish it - do not extend it for more than three hours, like this one. If you want to see a good movie on Alamo, take a look at John Wayne's 1960s version, or even the 1955 movie from which this movie stole his action scenes. Hard to believe that it took six producers to make such an ugly movie. Jump.
