A terrible movie that is supposed to be independent. It required a certain dependence on something. <br /> <br /> This totally miserable film deals with interactions between the Irish. Did they try to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, the film crashed completely. <br /> <br /> There is too much going on here. It was a little brat who ran and threw rocks in buses and cars, which obviously caused damage. > The movie is too hectic to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years, while her younger sister is scammed by a suitor. This makes the old sister become a bitter vetch and walks around with clothes that are not worthy to believe. The older sister is also angry but quickly finds love. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Obviously the theft is bad, but there does not seem to be any punishment for the crooks. Maybe the writers should have been punished for failing to create a coherent movie.
