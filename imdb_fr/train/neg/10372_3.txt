I was much more pleased with the commentary of the first criticism than that of the film when I saw it in a second-round theater in the early 80's. I was impressed by the care taken in creating costumes so close to drawings by Tenniel. But for me, the actors have been largely squandered, their personalities stifled by the masks, while the direction that I consider unusually static and the photography blurred. The note written at the time was nothing, which means "do not bother to get through even once". <br /> <br /> But I, too, would jump at the chance to take a second look.
