Let's see where to start ... bad game; I do not know if I would even call it that, because it looks more like a script reading effortlessly. The actors did not even seem to be part of their roles and seemed rather lifeless and apathetic. Of course, there was a scene or two with nudity, but that could not save this movie from his lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> Calling the main character as a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do it. The lyrics had neither rhythm nor fluidity and seemed rather relegated to foolish speeches. <br /> <br /> Budget? Did this film even have a budget? It seemed they were using less money than I had seen in a YouTube video taken at home. Bad lighting, accessories, poor sound post-production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them. The story could have been interesting if people seemed really interested in doing such a thing, but this movie had no life; I do not care who directed him. <br /> <br /> I've seen some very bad movies in the last year and this one is definitely at the bottom of the ladder. Do not waste your time or wish you listened to this unbiased review. Check the notes, you will see that the 1 quickly exceed the 10 plush with almost nothing in between. I would have liked to look a little closer before losing my time. What suc-fest!
