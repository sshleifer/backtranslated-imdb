When one thinks of captivity, many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, uninteresting, unsuspecting, careless, unfathomable and unassailable. <br /> <br /> I hated those mid-to-late 90s movies that were basically Scream scams, but these new imitations of Saw are starting to make these movies look like classics. They still bend to the same demographic that these other films have been so successful at, but now add a new degree of degeneracy that gives girls ages 12 to 14 that they are destined to feel hardcore and hip. <b> This movie is a boring poop load! What happened to Larry Cohen? His name has been associated with nothing good since 1993! Still, I was always surprised that he had something to do with something so bad! Has anyone been surprised when the love interest of the film turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did not someone know it when they first saw it? Only someone who has never seen another movie before!
