It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this movie: some are very weak thrillers (and I say very very weak), others are an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things were tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case, the film can not be maintained, because of a mediocre and superficial scenario, a bad acting and a cinema too dark and too dull. I would say that Salvatores gave the best of himself in other genres and in other contexts, where he was free to watch the characters without having to think about the plot. Overall, a B movie is not worth your money ... Vote: 4/10
