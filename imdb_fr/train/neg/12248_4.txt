The only highlight of the film is the death of the crying man and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a real Jaws scam, Lake Placid and Alligator, with a bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in it. <br /> <br /> As is the norm in a horror film of the 1990s, the two non-celebrity women are undressing each at least once. The main woman does not, because she obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole film is about shooting a really stupid extreme sport called surfing, where surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. In this film, a giant saltwater crocodile is also found in the area. People are being eaten. The film ends. <br /> <br /> A bad horror movie does not bother me, but I really hate a bad horror movie, which is really the case.
