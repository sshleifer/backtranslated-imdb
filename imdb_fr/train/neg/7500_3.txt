Spike Lee must be one of the most rated directors I have ever seen. He's the darling of the critic because he's supposedly making movies with a "message" or he's so bohemian in his approach that he's making critics imbued with the formula Hollywood movies eat his thing just for to be different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam does not even do it well. The style of cinematography and editing is that of Oliver Stone, as is the story. The plot is very similar to "Do the right thing". The representation of "Guidos" or for the Italian-American PC game (of which I am one of them) is quite out of Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression that a macho Italian competing with a much larger African-American is a lot, MUCH more believable than the caricature and wide-ranging caricatures illustrated here (the character of John Leguizamo being a possible exception). <br /> Is there anyone who has seen this movie that does not know how it will end? As soon as Richie entered the movie, I could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach, I could already see him being accused of being the killer. This character has had the greatest integrity in the entire movie, so of course, Lee will show what happens to people who stand out in the crowd (what a white-bearded clique!) <br /> <br /> Give to Spike Lee a lifetime pass for every basketball game he wants. So, maybe he's going to have too much fun buying a movie camera for a long time and we will not have to undergo his training so important and that besides, I will not have to see the critics (some of them respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor without clothes.
