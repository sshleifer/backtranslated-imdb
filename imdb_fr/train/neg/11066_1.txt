Before watching "Dahmer", I thought that no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To sum up "Dahmer", this is the story of a homosexual serial killer who almost does not tell the murder and is made up almost entirely of Dahmer encounters with homosexuals before they are killed. There is no conspiracy to find and it is useless to tell us anything about "Dahmer". Looking at this movie, all you'll know about Dahmer is that he liked having sex with men. Horrible acting, horrible director, horrible writing, all horrible ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and throwing up for three hours, go with the vomiting ... it will be less painful ...
