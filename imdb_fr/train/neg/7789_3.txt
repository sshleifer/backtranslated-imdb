Although not exactly offensive, the 1967 version of "The dangers of Pauline" is certainly stupid. The title may leave you wanting a tribute to Pearl White (Pauline's original in the 20-part silent series of 1914), but the 1947 version starring Betty Hutton would serve you better. This 1967 version looks like a mix of "Casino Royale" and the weakest Elvis movies. Worse still, it is not a mixture of these elements but rather that of segments scotchized between them so that the thing passes from one style to another. <br /> <br /> The unity of production stems from the marriage of Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), a good match because they do not have the most basic skills in action (imagine Mandy Moore playing in front of Dan Quayle). <br /> <br /> Austin would later play against John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade", with the disparity of talent between them really painful to watch. In the mid-1960s, she was the daughter of "Dodge Rebellion". That's why she was featured in a similar series of perilous situations - imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jumpsuit. When the manufacturer's advertising agency replaced it with the girl "Dodge Fever", someone had the brilliant idea of ​​presenting it in a feature film. <br /> <br /> The story begins here with Pauline who grew up in the Foundling Home-based baskerville run by the actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. in "Dobie Gillis". George falls in love with her (Pauline-not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages several opportunities she has to adopt. George goes in search of his fortune and Pauline, 19, finds a job of tutoring a young prince of the Middle East rich in oil. When he tries to add the pretty blonde to his harem, she runs away and goes from peril to danger. These include African pygmies, a 99-and-a-half-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze her until her one-year-old grandson is old enough for marriage, the film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is. intended to be silly and charming but only handles the silly part. Some efforts have been made to incorporate a silent movie aspect into the action sequences by simulating the under-starting of a camera (which speeds up the action). Unfortunately, everything else (film stock, production design, editing) is depressing from the 1960s. Nothing here even approaches the images of Pearl White attached to a log that goes to a circular saw or attached to a track railway, waiting for the approaching train. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
