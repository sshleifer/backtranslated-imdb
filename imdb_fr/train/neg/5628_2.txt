I am not an artistically inclined individual. I am a science-savvy woman and I felt that this movie was perhaps one of those campy artsy movies on a budget. I watched some with my fianc√© and my future daughter-in-law. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiance and daughter voted against and we went to Ocean's 13, but that's another story. To avoid being dissuaded, I woke up the next morning and gave another shot to the movie. I started watching this movie seriously. I just did not understand, I thought I would. I thought the most fun part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn looking for a place near the fire serving as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers. Interesting and there were always things dead inside. It was a strange and bizarre film. Maybe that's what they were after, but I will not be fooled a second time!
