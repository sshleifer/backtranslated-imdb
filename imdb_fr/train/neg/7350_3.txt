Despite very bad reviews, I just had to try this movie ?? after all, the HK super-girl, Shu Qi, as well as 6 other oriental worshipers, form a team of unparalleled burglars. Is it worth checking out? Well, as the holidays unfold, the martial angels are hard to beat. The eye candy is of superior quality. Shu Qi is still fantastic and among the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang have particularly caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if we judge this film according to its possible merits, it's an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the action of poor quality and the special effects downright pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and little else. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you plan to see it, you'd better watch Sex and Zen 2 again!
