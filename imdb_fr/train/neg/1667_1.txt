I actually liked this movie until the end. Of course, it was cheesy and rather unlikely, but it still caught my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, it is. For her last performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she struggled to catch up with the other students of classical training, what does the main character do? Wow them with his understanding and performance of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and massacres Carmen's sensual Habanera and turns her into a perfectly forgettable pop song by Brittany Spears. My ears have bled! And, at the supreme moment of horror, his teachers gave him a standing ovation! Any teacher who was not in a fantasy induced by Spears would have failed on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
