I have never really considered myself a "student" when it comes to watching movies, I look at them, I make an opinion and that's all. But Unhinged changed everything. This film is without a doubt the most inept movie making attempt I have ever seen. All children who think of the university being the next Spielberg or Tarantino must receive this film with a manual entitled "How not to make a film". Not only is there no story to tell, but the filmmakers were not even competent enough to make a movie worth watching. It's been a long time since I've seen it, but all I can say is to look at the shots above the head in the opening scenes. They never end! It's almost like you're pulling your teeth, but not as much fun.
