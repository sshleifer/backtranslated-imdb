I love Fulci's films, I really like them and not ironic, but I recognize that they seem desperately unfit and distorted to many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is where Fulci tries out the fantastic fantasy genre and does not really succeed. Structurally, it's like most Fulci movies you've seen. Some things happen, some more, and sometimes one scene can be tangentially related to another. Really, it's like Conan without scenery, without scenario, nor real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), without a budget, with stupid dog soldiers and a bunch of bloody people. <br /> It was difficult to cross and I could have lived without the Vaseline layer on the camera to give it this look of Hair Metal music video.
