An incredibly slow black comedy, too scripted, with a premise too intelligent and a bad acting. <br /> <br /> It might have worked like an episode of Twilight Zone or Tales from the Crypt, but in the middle of the end, you just want it to come to an end predictably and you have it already finished.
