It was a whole film: good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (a mysterious space missile threatens to burn the planet) and many animation sequences (if the Army of the air had filmed rockets, it was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film is about a space missile that is attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently deflected into a low atmospheric orbit. Within five miles and at a speed greater than 4,000 miles, it emits a million-degree exhaust, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, the basics of the Early Warning Line (DEW) and the Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Every attempt to destroy the missile fails. <br /> <br /> The first flaws of this film appear early. Although we do not expect much from low budget movies, some things can not be forgotten, like a little research. For example, the Soviets and the United States fire anti-ballistic missiles that attach themselves to the missile with unerring precision. However, the first successful ABM tests were not carried out until March 1961 by the Russians. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and her assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their novel with about as much wood as a log cabin. Parker's character cries and boo-hoos at Loggia's sacrifice as if she were on a test. Loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) is so afraid that he gives William Shatner the face of a spectator. A bus driver continually spits shit from end to end, scene after scene. The only good actor is the narrator of the film, played by the famous actor Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this could be overlooked without the timeline. Once the missile information is sent to Washington, the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will reach New York in 63 minutes. After that, the scientists discuss and there is a deadly lull while the ambassadors are asked to know if the missile is an attack of the Russians and if an answer is necessary. <br /> <br /> The film shows the army being completely scrambled. Civil Defense members leave their jobs and go to their workstations. Eight million people jostle in ruined shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids (and we see the whitest city in New York I've ever seen, though watching sci-fi movies The 50s seemed like a standard, the press stayed in the dark for tens of minutes, and incredibly, a Pentagon man announced that the missile would hit Ottawa, Canada, in 51 minutes! 12 minutes later, Loggia thinks of a way to stop the extraterrestrial missile, fueling the fire, slowly producing a load of plutonium, loading it into a jeep and transporting it from DC to a missile base to put it on the top of a missile, hit by a wild driver on the way, broken down, taken in a carjack, finally recovered the plutonium, and went to the base for arm the missile again, all this in the same time of 63 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film also irritates the viewer by giving the impression that Ottawa could be saved, but only to show men, women and children that they are roasting. The missile would then have five minutes to reach New York. Loggia always leads to the base (4 more miles). He arrives at the base and arms the missile, then a countdown of two minutes is announced. All within five minutes. The neighborhoods of New York should have been burned at least. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile is destroyed if you have not guessed it. The ABM warhead destroyed it by a massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. Five seconds later, the explosion dissipates and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion equivalent to 100 Hiroshimas in the suburbs of New York and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film had all the elements necessary to be a good movie of series B, but had ruined them. Loggia played his character so softly that they did not care that he sacrificed himself at the end. You make fun of the other characters, not even the scientific scientist played by Pine. The tension that should have brought the movie forward was simply not physically possible in the allotted time (this still would not be the case today, even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been reissued on any medium and for a good reason. I do not know if the film was supposed to be or if it was a common practice, but there is a scene in which the government sends all the best scientists, military and businessmen to deep shelters, saying they are too precious to be lost. There is not a single woman or a minority in the pack. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he starts playing a little piano. It was worse than "27 days" when an alien gives five earthlings the chance to save or destroy the planet and it does not include blacks or Hispanics. <br /> <br /> I've seen it on a special night The fi night on Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect it to happen again. If you find a copy somewhere, you may want to put it on Amazon.com.
