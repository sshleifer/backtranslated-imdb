I had the feeling that after "Submerged", this one would not be better ... I was right. He must be looking for the champagne money and not worry about the final product ... his voice is repeated several times by a stranger who does not sound like him; the editing is - finally - just a note superior to amateur. It's nothing more than a category B or C movie with just enough money to hire a talented cameramen couple and an "OK" sound designer. <br /> <br /> As the previous poster says, the problems seem to appear in the post-production (... doubling of voices, etc.) Too bad, because the plot is actually acceptable for a movie SG . <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG movie unless he sends me an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - Kelly LeBrock misses me ... <br /> <br /> --jimbo
