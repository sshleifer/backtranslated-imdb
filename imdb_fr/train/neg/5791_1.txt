As an Aboriginal film teacher, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with Aboriginal content I have ever seen. I would prefer to get a root canal instead of seeing this film again. The use of stereotypes, non-creative attempts to use traditional coyote story excerpts and the camera's poor workmanship have only been compounded by the simplicity of the non-creative story and the bad scenario. The writer and director showed the worst aspects of a colonized approach to representing indigenous peoples and communities. If that person is Aboriginal, she must go home and apologize to everyone she knows for her skin and for the internalized racism and low sense of humor that she has developed. If this person is not Aboriginal, she must seriously reconsider her white privilege and ask herself whether she displays an unexamined and unintentional racism, or if she intentionally ignores it. My only hope is that the Aboriginal actors in this film had a good time and at least been paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Aboriginal movies, check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dancing Me Out, Medicine River, Pow-Wow Highway, Smoke Signals ... just to name a few.
