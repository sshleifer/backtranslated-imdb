I really wanted to love this movie and I looked all the way thinking he needed to get better. Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie of all time, but it never lives up to its potential. The premise is good, the casting is great (I was particularly excited about the return of David Naughton) and, God loves them, you can say that everyone has done their best. He just falls again and again. "Brutal Massacre" should remind filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest's films and that, despite the fact that it makes things easier, you should probably forget to try to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic and should be seen more often ... they are the reason he gets 4 stars from me. If you're going to have the "Spinal Tap" horror, I guess you might want the guy who made "Spinal Tap" directs it ... just thinking out loud.
