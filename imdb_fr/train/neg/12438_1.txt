Beat the bad guys ... Again, the slogan of this film is such that it exposes so many truths about it. <br /> <br /> Home Alone one and two, the movie classics. Home Alone three and four, a good movie if you are three years old! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as difficult as it sounds to be funny, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. It's a very bland actor with bland performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing has called for a bland vocabulary and bland expressions. The pranks are just copied from the first two with different scammers, and you have to be blind to think that chickenpox is real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which this movie is presented on a rainy day. And to make matters worse, a totally different distribution, go see if you do not believe me, but you'll regret it.
