I saw this movie in cinema class. I'm glad I did not pay to see him. I walked in with an open mind and was even a little excited. I really appreciate Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I just never connected with this movie. The acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the scenario, or rather its absence, was a problem. There was no central theme connecting the film. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Not really. Was it a western? Somehow, but no. I'm all for the twists in the movies, I recently saw "Brick" and I liked it, but the place where this movie went was just too much outside. It was so weird, and if I did not have to watch the whole movie, I'd be out. The writing was not great, but it was just everywhere. At the end of this film, I was terribly confused and wanted it to be finished sooner. There was just something in this film that did not resonate, I understand more quirky movies like "Fight Club", but I did not care at all about the characters.
