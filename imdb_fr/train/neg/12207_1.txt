I remember that I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12, a Commodore 64 and I love to play Rambo. So I was really happy when I was able to buy this really cheap movie. I put it in my VCR and I started: This movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words throughout the movie (with the exception of that ugly sentimental speech in the end), and has the same expression on his face all the time. And that stupid love thing in the middle is so incredibly predictable. I just finished transferring everything quickly and went to exchange the film for something else.
