I must say that I was a big fan of the show. The first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a shame because it was an excellent series and it only gets worse. I know they are designed for DVD movies, but efforts would be helpful. <br /> <br /> There is no laughter, but some good doubles that will make you smile. There is nudity and very hot girls. But neither the sexy side nor the jokes really work. <br /> <br /> To add to all this, it's also a racist or racist movie that can be done without asking to be labeled racist. I am not one of those who think that everything should be politically correct. But the representation of minorities is very shocking. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time on this trash. See previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.
