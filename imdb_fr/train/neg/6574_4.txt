(Avast, little spoilers to come) This library from my local library allowed me to keep a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I've already been to Matewan, West Virginia, and in a small museum I saw the schedule of the Municipal Theater in May 1954. The movies changed every day at the theater. As there would be no television for another ten years in these areas, it was largely entertainment available in the city. "The Raid" seems to have been created for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although it's not listed for this month, I'm sure I was presented there on a Monday or Tuesday night for an audience that was not probably not too demanding. The historic raid - audacious and remarkably successful - does not seem to have been the subject of much research. The film is full of Hollywood embellishments, including a loose gun played by Lee Marvin. Marvin takes the opportunity to practice freedom. And St. Albans seems to have had more Yankee soldiers coming and going in the city than Washington DC. <br /> <br /> What really made me sneer is when the raiders donned their Confederate uniforms . The rebel uniforms look so bright. When Anne Bancroft's son took Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, I expected him to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then, there is Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I looked on IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The contractual actress of the time then in studio does not look like her subsequent films and has nothing of the presence she would have later in "The Worker of miracles", "Agnes of God" and of course " The graduation". <br /> To see if only 1). you live in St. Albans and 2). you have a few hours to kill on a fiction in Hollywood of the biggest reportage of your hometown.
