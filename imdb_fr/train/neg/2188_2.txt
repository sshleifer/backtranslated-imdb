Following a car accident, a mad scientist (Jason Evers) keeps alive the head of his fianc√©e (Virgina Leith). He then lurks in search of the ideal body to restore it. Lacky enough all around, nothing buys here. Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton are also part of the cast. Someone should have helped him out of his misery. Let him die.
