Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it is - unfortunately - worse than you think. First, the plot is silly, it makes no sense. The scenario is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience laughed several times. And the suspense is very low. The actors play a little, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has good moments but also terribly bad times. The saddest parts are when she tries to be sexy aggressively and says things like "I want * you * beep *" and that looks like, let's say it softly, to a very very mature woman who behaves in a coarse and not at all sexy. This erotic tension of BI1 has totally disappeared. From a technical point of view, Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre film - better than a classic DVD, but much lower than the original movie. For example, the scene of the crazy ride is poorly done. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his shows. The script is made by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas. The film seems cheap and badly edited at the same time. I'm sorry but my first thought after leaving the cinema was this: "Why did not they make this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?" The original movie looks like Citizen Kane compared to that. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of breakthrough in popular cinema. It was challenging, sexy and controversial. He had the best performance of Sharon Stone in his career. He had that specific style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentionally funny, misdirected movie and a certain Razzie Award winner in many categories. Too bad they made this film.
