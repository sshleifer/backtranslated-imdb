I could not help laughing !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But no matter, it's a lot of fun! In this film, you do not have to pay attention to anything! The acting is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I could see the stick holding the T-Rex's head for a while.) The raptors are the same as those of the Carnosaurus 2, T-Rex is also identical, but ... In some scenes, his head is a little drunk and it looks like some sort of failure of the kindergarten project. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, in fact I speak of quick editing, they did it so fast that we can not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! too late, they are rubber! Well, only the interesting things here are to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... do not rent it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's a lot more entertaining!
