Once, I used the name of Wesley Snipes as a clue to watch a new unreleased movie in which he appears. So now, for the first time, my Snipes-Method movie recommendation method has failed. Totally. I should have come here first to see these critics. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow his serious efforts to be lost in "The Entrepreneur". <br /> <br /> One of my worst fears have been completed. I feared that the "inconsiderate" directorial and directorial style, fragile, fuzzy, pseudo-documentary (which the film "Bloody Sunday" (directed by Paul Greengrass) brought to my attention) could spread to other films. Greengass's disgusting style was then taken to nauseating highs in the last two Bourne trilogy movies. My fear was gone. In my opinion, these films are made really bad by these methods inducing motion sickness, which confuse fuzzy scans with the "strengthening of action". But the "Bourne Franchise", as Greengrass so likes to call his cash cow, has apparently convinced other Hollywood's to show little professionalism in their quest for big, fast dollars. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, Hollywood types. The action must be clearly photographed and presented, and not simply suggested by mediocre and lazy cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" goes so far as to imitate "The Bourne Ultimatum" by unexpectedly reproducing the sound. in the hope that their youthful (apparently evaluated) audiences will not feel them. For example, if I hear a police officer's radio cracking "Yankee-Romeo" again, I'm just going to scream. Chances are good. I will never hear it again. I will certainly never see "the contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to those of you who have not yet seen "The Contractor": only be satisfied with the tranquility that this lack provides for your life. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10; I am tempted to lower that to a 1.
