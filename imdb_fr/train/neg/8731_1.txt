the lowest possible score is a star? It's a shame. really, I'm going to put pressure on IMDb for a "zero star" option. give this film even a single star gives too much. Am I the only one to notice that the microphones hung over the hopper's head at the station? and the actor, or should I say the lack of it? Apparently, talent was not a factor when the casting director arrived in town. The talent show at my little sister's primary school offers a wider and deeper range of emotions. and these false Irish accents resembled nails on a blackboard. the only thing that could have worsened this movie would have been ... oh, wait, no, no, it's already as serious as possible.
