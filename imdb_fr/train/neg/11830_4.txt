OK maybe a 13 year old kid like me was a bit old for this movie. It's about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat throws it in the toilet! He ends up in this rat town and meets this rat girl who has a little gem that a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this jewel that he sends an entire army after these two rats. He intends to take the jewel and flood the city with rats! The most interesting part of this movie is about slugs. They make all the sound effects. They sing, make noise, it's great, it's also very funny. OK, in the end, it is meant for 7 years. Otherwise, a good movie to do with a younger family member. However, I did not think the animation was a true dreamworks art, more like WAllace and Gromit. I think they're a little lazy about it. The movie was just decent, no need to spend $ 9.50 for, sorry.
