Enough for you? Wait to see this <br /> heavy adaptation of a small collegiate act. What is shocking and wild in college <br /> <br /> rarely holds up over time, and that's the proof. Getting on with <br /> <br /> the Catholic church with its colorful humor is just not shocking nor <br /> <br /> interesting nor funny, it's rather boring. The performers are all <br /> <br /> games, giving everything they have, but it's basically a piece that does not open <br /> <br /> to film well. Not very fun.
