This Italian semi-horror film initially looks very porn and turns into a mystery that has many weak points to be good. The fact that it is rather dull makes this film rather unattainable for my taste. . The only thing that is really worth watching, are the many tits scattered in the film. The story goes that a guy who, at the beginning of the film, drew girls to his castle, then took him to his dungeon, went crazy and seemed to kill them. They show nudity, but they never really show the murders at this stage of the movie. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and decides to go out with her and marry her. He has a weakness for red heads, as his beloved former wife, Evelyn, is one of them. She also died in circumstances that were not to be the public's business. After many wacky scenes, murders involving snakes, foxes and others begin to happen. At this point, it is quite easy to determine who is responsible for the murders and what is the motive, then you have an absurd ending where everything ends less well. This film just did not work for me, it left me a lot of questions and the last third of the movie just did not have the breasts of the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining the death of Evelyn would have helped the film because it would have had some kind of end when Evelyn came out of the grave. Admittedly, the title is not totally misleading because it has somehow left the grave, but not by itself. The gore is very light for most because there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with a lot of blood too. I thought for the most part, this movie was a little dull.
