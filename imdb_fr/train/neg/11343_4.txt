1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): supposed dull and not spectacular continuation of the animated classic "101 Dalmatians". Yes, the film continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that it plays a bit like the original. One of the great advantages of the original was the rhythm of the story, that it does not have. The animation is also very little spectacular for Disney and all we get are the same characters who come back in the same kind of story. When will Disney stop boring us with sequels and rehearsals, etc.? etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre rate they have proposed.
