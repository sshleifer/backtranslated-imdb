I'm really surprised that this movie gets a ranking like this one! I have not seen such a bad movie in years. In fact, it was really a bad movie. Splashing is not enough to describe unnecessary (almost funny) blood scenes. If you did not like hostel2, Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007), well, it's 10 times worse. The story reminds me of the goosebumps of RL Stine. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you the acting, because the scenario was so terrible.Click all the time. (Why do I have to write 10 lines?) I never understood that. <br /> <br /> == Here comes the spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story tells that a butcher kills people all the time in the subway. We are talking about thousands of murders and no one is aware of it. In fact, these people are simply missing. And there is the good guy who tries to solve the mystery (well, there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and, as usual, no one believes it! What a surprise! In the end, he puts on butcher's clothes and fights with the killer butcher!
