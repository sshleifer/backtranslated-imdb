THE CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a so-called product slasher in the form of a movie directly on DVD. I say "so-called" because the title of the film does not include the "V" in parentheses to indicate that it is a film designed for a DVD (even if it looks like it). <br /> <br /> The plot is simple ?? a group holds a concert in an old meat factory and they are killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most people will agree that the film will never be a masterpiece, but that does not excuse the mistakes. right here. Even movies directly on DVDs such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb index) have many redeeming qualities and sometimes appear as one of the movies called "so bad, they are good". However, THE CHOKE is far from being a serious slasher (like HALLOWEEN) or a movie "so bad it's good" (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The film starts good with a character killed with a drill. The effects of blood were very tacky but understandable given the very small budget. But, from there, the descent is total. <br /> <br /> There are so many faults in THE CHOKE that I could spend the whole day talking about it. But some evidence stands out and I will go there. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned concert that the group seems to start with about fifty people present, but after the end of the music, there seems to be only about 8 people left (and yet they are all intended to be locked up!). <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not at all friendly. Most members of the group are aggressive fools or just strange. Nobody really cares about what happens to them and even their supposed friends forget them when they are sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meat packing plant as a kind of church (seriously!). He launches really funny lines for no apparent reason. But unfortunately, even his presence can not save the film. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterization. About 65 minutes of the film were spent watching characters walking around talking. The characters disappear for long periods without explanation. As in other DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time cursing themselves aggressively, without any provocation. There are a lot of extravagant explosions (mostly male characters) and one of them is almost a fight in its own right. In fact, one could say that the format is as follows: the characters walk - a murder takes place - the characters are walking - the murder takes place. You understood the idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are pronounced without the word-word used. It may have been funny, but it's sad. And more precisely, we've all seen it done a thousand times before (usually with a much larger effect). <br /> <br /> The film is totally devoid of suspense. The corpses only serve to indicate that the characters are in danger. A maniac running in freedom and yet the characters behave like morons. They try very little to leave the factory or find a weapon to protect themselves. And most of the time, they do not even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the murderer is not seen at the time the murders are committed (with the exception of the final murder when the identity of the murderer is revealed). A random weapon appears from nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is nobody seen who harasses the characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, it made the movie funny (involuntarily of course), but here it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> And, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes is very bad, even for those who love punk rock. The extras seem uncomfortable to dance. The score (in the end, there is no music at the beginning!) Consists of a group of Sugarbabe aspirants singing a very bad song that has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points. done in this review. This critic likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But, it seems that THE CHOKE has tried too hard to fit into one of these categories without adapting to it. And even if the movies are shooting directly on DVDs, this is a mediocre effort. <br /> <br /> The film contains scenes of bloody murders. But when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes quickly lose their importance, their intensity disappearing into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of 1980s B movie slashers should take steps to avoid this film. And fans of classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it!
