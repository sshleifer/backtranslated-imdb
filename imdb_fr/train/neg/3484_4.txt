I remember when it was in the theaters, the critics said it was horrible. Well, I did not think it was so bad. It was fun and there was a lot of ironic humor about the families around the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich man who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to the house where he grew up and makes a deal to rent the family for Christmas. I really liked the lawyers scene where they sign a contract. It was funny. <br /> <br /> He makes silly requests to the family and even writes them scripts to read. Of course, the family has a hot girl for love. And he learns that holidays are not so bad after all. <br /> <br /> Also, the whole act of doo-dah was funny, especially when they replaced the first by a black guy, and the parents of the girlfriend Do not even say anything. And the parts where Doo-Dah attacks his "supposed girl". FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was worth checking if you caught it with a cable.
