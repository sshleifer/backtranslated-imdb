BEGIN SPOILER: Perfectly funny and memorable for Mr. Chong's smoking scene: Chong coldly crushes a kitchen cockroach lost in the bowl of his pipe, lights, coughs and pirates violently for an apparent eternity, then with a perfect aplomb and Do not skip a beat, re-load the bowl properly, re-light, hit again. END OF SPOILER. Alas, I began to lose confidence in the middle of the process. I realized that the maverick duo is really odious and less than relatable. I came to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners, Harold and Kumar. I just prefer a brighter company. Still, the movie is probably an ideal choice for baked brothers or sisters or for viewers who have a spirit so weak that they are overwhelmed by a stoner when - the first are sober. A remarkable appearance of Paul Reubens bursting with obscenities in a pre-pee-wee form.
