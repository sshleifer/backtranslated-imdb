This is the last time I rent a video without logging in to IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote the Nightwatch writer with Ewan Macgregor and directed a film like Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it's a pity he got involved in such a bad movie. There are often confusing mounts that seem like a last minute decision to make up for the absence or the story, the filming and the common sense. This film is all wrong. What were they thinking?
