What is that? This is one of the most stupid movies I've seen. I do not understand why people on this site like it so much. His foolishness & nudity for no reason. Its worse then Resident Evil. I do not recommend it highly unless you want to watch bullshit bad acting. Watch real horror movies like Stephen King's It, The Shining, Jurassic Park (a little ugly), JAWS, etc. Leave this shit for a rental when there is nothing else to rent. It's bad like Crudy vs. Gayson. The killer tomato attack is better than this shit. <br /> <br /> Oh wow, flesh eating zombies. How many zobie movies do we need? SKIP this one. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
