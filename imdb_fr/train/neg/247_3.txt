It was 9:30 pm last night at my friend's camping caravan and we were so excited to watch South Park (a new episode). The problem is that in my country, South Park is broadcast at 22:30 and we decided to waste time watching the current show, Father of the Pride. I will start by saying that I only watched episodes. The first time I looked at it, I found it unusual and rude for nothing, so I thought, 'God, I have a football match early tomorrow morning, so I have to stop looking at drawings stupid humorous ''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father a second chance of pride. I think it's a real Simpsons scam, replacing only human characters with lions. <br /> <br /> The second thing is that I wonder why he got the TV-14 rating. I find the Simpsons much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity of this show is some homosexual jokes (not funny). The Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween specials) and raw. I also heard that the creator of the series also made Shrek 2. Well, I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he stayed too much in the family theme. However, I must admit that Father of Pride made me smile (even burst out laughing) three or four times. <br /> <br /> All in all, I do not mind father of pride. I do not hate it, but I do not like it either. I saw a lot better of "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
