It's not a very good film, but according to the news, it's quite accurate to describe the torture techniques. The film was intended to show the brutality of the NK POW camps, in a sufficiently effective manner and with a surprising frankness for the time. Whatever the technical flaws that exist (and there are many), looking at this, you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty things - again, nasty because they're going north from the DMZ and not to Guantanamo Bay. > <br /> I do not think one of the Korean veterans talked about his torture when he showed up, and if you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill versus Vietnamese movies. I do not know if it's the people of '54 who are trapped in the concepts of the Second World War (boys tend to chat a lot) or war or whatever, but it's interesting to see that from the same system that 16 years later make movies like "Go Tell The Spartans".
