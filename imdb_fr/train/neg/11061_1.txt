Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons known to all, the filmmakers wanted to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. I hope you are joking? The man has given a new meaning to the phrase "lick your fingers well"! And with all the flashbacks and flash-forward, I had trouble following the story. Overall, Jeremy Renner's performance was not that bad. You can catch him in "S.W.A.T.", in which he plays a disgruntled ex-policeman. Anyway, I would say it's 1/10. He only got 1 because of Renner's poor performance. There are many television books and documentaries that better cover the crimes of Dahmer. Avoid this one.
