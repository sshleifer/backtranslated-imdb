Unless you're twelve, this movie is not worth it. This is obviously a low budget movie with actors B, and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires work in CGI intense and poor quality. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I like to laugh at bad movies. I did not know how bad it was. It's bearable, until after the second hour, so it really starts to burn. Combat styles range from normal combat obeying the laws of physics to fighting over wire. There is no real explanation for transitions. There is a plot, but again, it's obviously a children's film. It seems like there are moral lessons of the day that are explicit, like Sesame Street or something like that. It's bearable. But much better if you are, for example, new.
