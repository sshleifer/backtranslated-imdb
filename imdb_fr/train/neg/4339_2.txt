This movie was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this film was called something else, nobody would even notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really strange because I can not see the point. the pre-sequence and the continuation simply allow to say that it does not have sense, that they do not even correspond. maybe I'm naive but it's not a flight 1 and a flight 2 meant to match. <br /> <br /> carlito was in prison in the first and died in the original, and in the previous he lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was OK, but they should have changed around some actors and the screenplay and the name of the movie. It was a good movie. <br /> <br /> I was really expecting it to end as the other one started. <br /> <br /> if anyone has an opinion on this post it please.
