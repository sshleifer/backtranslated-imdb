Live! Yes, but no kicks. <br /> <br /> True story: Some time ago, a Dutch television channel announced that it would broadcast a new reality show. A contest rather. The main participant in this program would be a woman who died of illness and gave her kidneys to a lucky person with progressive kidney failure. For real. <br /> <br /> The country and the international media have covered this story like a fly on a shit, saying it was appalling, immoral, what-is-it- - -, -, -, -, -, -, similar. In a way, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> Over the months, the tension has accumulated to such an extent that the government was mainly concerned with whether or not to let this show take place instead of directing the country. <br /> <br /> The show was broadcast and until the last moment, she moved on. And until the last minute, the country was in the arms, the prime minister making speeches, all the newspapers writing about it, all the inhabitants of the country holding their breath. And the network continued. Towards a new frontier on television. And they really managed to do exactly that. They pushed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show was broadcast and we all watched a terminally ill woman pick the right candidate to receive her kidneys so that he would live, while she would die soon after. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it was revealed that it was a partial hoax. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The show as a whole, which, with advertising and commercials and all the discussions, was built for months at a fantastic high point, was a publicity stunt to draw attention to the problem of major donor shortages. organ. The man who founded this network died of kidney disease himself. <br /> <br /> It's the television. Leaving everyone behind him, amazed. <br /> <br /> Do not give me a misinterpreted and poorly realized movie about a woman trying to get a Russian roulette show on American television. <br /> <br /> yes. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I had to believe they would get this through the FCC. As if I had to believe that it would go through the US Supreme Court on the basis of freedom of expression. As if I believed in the ridiculous end where this woman kidnapped her and has problems of conscience because a guy shot himself in the head. <br /> <br /> Everything has already been done. See Running Man with Arnold instead. At least his end was semi good. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a horribly bad movie, with a ridiculous ending. So she gets shot at the end, is that supposed to make the movie audience feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? Do not take my word for it, but I would say this: leave this one quiet and watch a test pattern instead, you will get more quality.
