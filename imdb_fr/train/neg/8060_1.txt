What a bad movie! I tried to watch without fast forward ... This failed. After about 30 minutes, I stopped the movie, went to see how many minutes had lasted this disaster. (Only 84 minutes, whew!) It was a confusing and boring movie. I do not think anyone can be knocked down by being hit with a fluorescent bulb even less eviscerated by one! The only funny thing is that I watched the movie version of "The Killer Cut". The box boldly says "More blood!" "More sex!" "More terror than the theatrical release!" Yuck! If this movie was horrible with all these claims, I wonder how the "UN-Killer Cut" was lame ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead, watch one of the series of Night of the Living Dead!
