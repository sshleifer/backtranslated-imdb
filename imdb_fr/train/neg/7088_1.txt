My wife subjected me to this atrocity, I tried to extinguish it after 10 minutes, but I was forced to do it. It must be, hands down, the most macabre excuse of a movie ... <br /> <br /> There have been great script moments, such as: <br /> <br /> Sammy - "If she succeeds right now, she gets a bonus" Madam - "A silly thing?" Sammy - "No, a bonus" <br /> <br /> To summarize: A horrible scenario, an acting game terrible and incredibly illogical.
