slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the film of the book. This is surely a case where the film should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was the landscape, excellent. The worst was the slow interactions of actors who combined with innumerable significant looks. The editing is abrupt and uneven. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard, at least trying to be a bit credible with a terrible scenario. It was amazing that even though it was happening in Peru, there was hardly anyone of Peruvian descent wandering about the scenery - even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have a sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
