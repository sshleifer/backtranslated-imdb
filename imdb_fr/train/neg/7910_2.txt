I saw the essence of "My Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC Film Festival in New York, and I had to leave the theater because of feelings of nausea inside me. I saw Bollywood movies and satires of Bollywood movies. This movie could not decide which one he wanted to be, so it turned out to be a joke on himself. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been widely copied from movies like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy and lazy job at that. How can Bollywood never be freed from its determination to stick to overused and well-used scripts? Is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real and fascinating stories that exist and unfold in the country of a billion people? The car driver too smart, the cow in the street, free scenes of foreign places, unnecessary scenes of the streets of Mumbai, everything is there. All possible clich√©s about India have been faithfully included. So predictable, disgusting. Ugh!!! Interim performances are weak, except for Neha Dubey, talented and beautiful. One wonders why she would choose a project like this.
