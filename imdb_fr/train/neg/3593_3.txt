It's a 1974 German movie that has something to do with women coming into a castle and beyond, I can not really tell you what their purpose is, or even what is the purpose of the film. I can tell you that there are many women who work as moonlighters as servants in this particular castle who undress, put body paint and spin on bongos like the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, and this seems to be a good part of the running time of this movie. Yeah, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and there's girl-to-girl stuff, etc., but the main focus seems to be the painted girls spinning in the basement. I rather liked the observation of one of the main governesses / adorers of the devil, who conferred an authenticity to the procedure and made it even more nasty. Was it Wanda the Evil Lesbian (as shown in the credits)? It does not matter. If you're not too picky about your lesbian devil adoration movies, you might like this, otherwise it's a pretty boring thing and I could not even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10
