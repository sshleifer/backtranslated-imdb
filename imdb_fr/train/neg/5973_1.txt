This film is another fine example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be best placed to film a film a year before its release and not end up with a quality film. I am not a film critic, but this film was as predictable as possible. Every joke attempt, every attempt to touch a touching moment, and the pitiful attempt at a love story were exactly what I predicted in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one.
