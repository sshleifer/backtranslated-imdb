Oh it was really a bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is fine, but I think she plays the role of a bitch in the movie, not because she gets her organs pulled by a raven at night, but because she plans to fire her agent for putting it in this shit. Faye Dunaway acts as if she remakes Mommy Dearest and the end is completely stupid. I really can not recommend this film, even if as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, the references to his work (Ravens, the family curse of House of Usher, and the burial alive) intrigue me a little. would probably go back to his grave if he knew about this movie.
