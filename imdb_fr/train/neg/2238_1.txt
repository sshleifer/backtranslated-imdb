The video quality is horrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The acting is horrible. The dialogue is painful. The lighting is dismal. The editing is laughable. I could go on, but it would be useless. Snitch'd is a third-rate amateur video presented as a feature film. This one is better to leave the dust in the basket of the good deals of the video store.
