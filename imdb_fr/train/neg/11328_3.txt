From time to time, I'll be renting an action / adventure movie just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and allows me to relax for a while. One of these days, I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this film because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged. . For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot looked like an episode of Xena badly written, and the role of Kathy Long was a very community theater (not bad for a professional kickboxer and amateur actress). There were some strong points from the cyborgs. Somehow they managed to get really good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die very quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies, the more you advance in the movie, the more emphasis is put on the action and the plot (which was not strong at beginning) deteriorates almost as fast as the actor. However, the longer Kathy Long fights, the longer the director spends time on her. At the end of the movie, I was seriously considering watching it a second time, just to count the number of times Kathy Long's tight red shorts were the central screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was just not enough meat film to make a satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time. If you're a fan of Xena who needs something to lose a few hours, go to the grocery store and spend 50 cents on renting. There are strong similarities between the series and this film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect anything more than just having fun for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Except, of course, you love Kathy Long's behind. THEN you may want to buy a copy.
