I just saw this movie and decided to see what others thought about it. I wonder if those people who give rave reviews have seen the same movie! It's potentially a very good story, but it does not succeed. The scenario is very small - the plot has so many holes that it would be an excellent net for the fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the plot jumps so much that I ended up asking the question "How did we get here?" at least half a dozen times during the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry among the members of the cast. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during filming. It was clear that everyone had introduced themselves and had done their job, but had not engaged in his role. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that deserves to be seen ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a hot bath and save your money for something that is worth it the trouble!
