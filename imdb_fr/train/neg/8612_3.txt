It was a movie to watch, but the plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were Rodney's previous movies. That said, it was worth the time to watch. I gave it a 5 out of 10. So, basically, this is one of those movies that you do not go your way to see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
