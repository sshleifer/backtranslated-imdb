Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the screenplay for Aronofsky's film. This film has succeeded at all levels by providing an intimate and impartial portrait of the horrors of the lives of the characters and vices that destroyed them. "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has the vice and multiple characters that lead a sad life, but that does not do them much the same justice as Arronofsky. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes seems ridiculously anti-gay. Especially when in the film, homosexuality is synonymous with death. A gay character gets fucked, is thrown into the sky by a car at high speed and lands on the sidewalk. Another is crucified and still others are simply beaten. Another element of exaggerated shock, which might have been convincing if it had been well done, is the confrontation of unionized workers with scabs. Who would have thought that a drama about Brooklyners would present action sequences and truck explosions? <br /> <br /> The director, Uli Edel, has a level of competence comparable to that of a television director, but he is far from being up to it. movies. The film is clumsy and can not even settle on a genre. Lake is attributed a useless role that any model could have occupied and Baldwin seems to know that appear stupid in his role just as minimal. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh as our leader, a disgusting bitch named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). His performance is not great and the fate of his character is dirty to say the least. Poor use of color and composition makes it seem cheaper than it is, and also removes the "real" advantage of the most provocative elements. A failure.
