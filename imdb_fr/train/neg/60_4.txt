I like Goldie Hawn and I wanted another one of his films. So when I saw Protocol at $ 5.50 at Walmart, I bought it. Although slightly amusing, the film never really hits. Some scenes, like a party scene in a bar, take too long and really do not help. <br /> <br /> Then there is of course the scene preached at the end of the film that gives the whole filming a bad taste in my case. I do not think this scene has been added to the movie. I do not like stupid comedies that try to teach me a lesson, written especially by the burn-out of the 60s! <br /> <br /> In the end, even though I'm happy to own another Hawn movie, I'm not. Of course, it was worth the money I paid!
