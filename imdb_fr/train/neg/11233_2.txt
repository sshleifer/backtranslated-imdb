From what I can tell you, despite previous comments posted by other commentators, this film is currently available on DVD. I found it just a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's written on the Value DVD label and I paid the grand total of 98 cents plus taxes. I found it in a 98-cent shop, among plastic baskets and disposable chopsticks. Now, is not it, the people who spent a lot of money for the super-imported version of the Swedish import super-duper edition feel as if you had it ??? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This film was worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I could start chatting with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember that by saying about what you pay for. For lovers of slasher movies only.
