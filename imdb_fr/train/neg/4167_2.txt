I was anxious to see "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I had, however, was a nap of an hour and a half. The premise seemed nice: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, owner of a company called "Mr. Fix It", where subcontracted men are asking for their help to get their friends back. <br /> <br /> movie are editing, scripting and acting. Although I found Boreanaz enchanting in his other roles at the movies (with the exception of his movie "Crow" he did), it was disappointing. Sometimes his character was interesting and others, flat. The support cast reminded me of soap opera players. I realize it was not a big budget movie, but some of the scenes and music just did not look good. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
