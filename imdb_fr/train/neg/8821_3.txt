Why, oh, why will not they learn? When you have a juicy operating gadget, use it! Do not try to lose yourself deeply and think. you will only look silly. <br /> <br /> Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a little too much Mom kissing (his father dressed like) Santa Claus on his return was a kid. So, of course, Harry gets obsessed with Christmas and finally, when his disillusionment gets too big, he undresses, dresses up as Santa Claus and wanders around the city giving toys to good little children and viciously killing all those who he thinks he's mean. <br /> <br /> Pretty simple, it's not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other holiday-themed horror movies use the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this movie is more about "Santa Claus, Portrait of a Serial Killer" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night" . Two-thirds of the film is dedicated to documenting Harry's slow but inevitable breakup, when I would have liked to buy the premise when the first titles were released. You know that a slasher movie is in danger when you ask the killer to do it already. <br /> <br /> Maybe the fall of Harry in madness could have been convincing in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, it's his only movie, and it shows. The action jumps abruptly from scene to scene, without establishing clear plans or views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing. <br /> <br /> Even once the film is started, we are still treated to heaps of self pity, insecurity and Harry's neurotic behavior. More depressing than frightening, Christmas Evil is to be avoided.
