This film is the biggest waste of nine dollars I've spent for a very long time. If you knew how many times I go to the movies, you say, it's hard to imagine, but nevertheless, it's true! After watching the trailer of this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you love horror, mystery and suspense, why not you? The trailer is nothing short of intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the film is not part of it. <br /> <br /> From cinematography to script, to acting, this film is a complete failure. If you're reading this, plan to go to the movie hoping for chills, mystery, action, horror or something else than a one-hour, forty-five-minute loss, I'm afraid your disappointment do not be disappointed. <Br /> <br /> "Why is this so serious", could you ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor suspensive. Nothing in the film made me the least bit "exhausted", frightened or curious. The script was at best laughable. There have been many times in the film where the dialogue was so ridiculous that I began to write it as a comic relief, only to discover a few seconds later that it was not. The game was absolutely horrendous. I like Nicholas Cage but it was a lack. Without exception, every performance of this movie was incredibly inferior to the average. Cinematography was horrible without any moment of suspense or mysticism. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this film arrive at one kilometer. <br /> <br /> I am not usually a very severe critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy, I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was boring, misinterpreted, poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
