There are so many wacky things in this film that I can only name a few: <br /> <br /> The character of BOGART: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'm going to leave it there, God, it sounds like "Humphrey".) 2. Her long curly hair and her favorites. 3. His Black Bart outfit, complete with spurs! 4. I do not know what lipgloss color they made her wear, but it's not very flattering. <br /> <br /> The character of CAGNEY (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick does not serve him. , no more. 2. The man is swallowed by his hat during the whole movie! Could not they find a hat for him to go? Even a little bit? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight at the back. 4. He too often blows smoke from his gun, if you know what I mean, and I think so. If you are an occasional fan of Bogart or Cagney, and imagine it might be a change of pace to see them in a western, do yourself a favor and forget that thought. EVEN HORSES ARE EMBARRASSED! (That is, they do not seem to be bored.) <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I admit that westerns are my favorite movie genre, but I still many seen, MUCH better than that. At the comedy level, or as a high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it's spectator, beware. Therefore, see this only if a) you must see all Westerners there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie COMPLETE c) one of the above comments interests you. Woah ?? ..
