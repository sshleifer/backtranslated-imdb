There have been more interesting Polish documentaries about breeding worms, in brail_ !! The competition (breeding worms) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically sick after watching this movie. The deceitful husband (I think dougray_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer really needs the job and what was with the accent !! Random places and encounters reminded me of a high school joke and showed the humility of a 10-year-old child in cooking class. It was so bad that I think I'll write the rest of it, "It's not laxitive." Thank you for listening, it was a considerable weight of my conscience.
