What a terrible waste !!! Who are all those people who are bitching about how good it is? Yes, it's "arty"; and yes, it's "foreign", but ... it's not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed, like a reality show, but it has not been done with so much skill. <br /> <br /> People are inherently uninteresting; but as characters, they do not have enough depth to empathize with them. If they are based on real people, I am really sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The violence (and part of it is very violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous. It's as if the producer had the vision of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think a lot about him either. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: if I had neighbors like that, I would move!
