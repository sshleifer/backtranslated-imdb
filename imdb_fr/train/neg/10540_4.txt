Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a Satan / serial killer disciple who owns the "First Power": even after being captured by detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he can move his mind melee and continue to murder at will. With the help of seductive midfielder Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, half-sister of Melanie G.), he tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably offered some possibilities, but finally, "The First Power" suffers scripts and making routine movies. It's nothing we've never seen before, sometimes done better. Nothing in this film distinguishes it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More specifically, it's not very exciting and it's certainly not scary. Phillips is hard to sell as a cynical cynical cynical stereotype, and Griffith does not seem to want to strive too hard; The best member of the cast is probably Kober, who has a remarkable distinction, doing his best to be extremely scary. <br /> <br /> The climax is rather ridiculous and the end very weak. <br /> <br /> Not really acceptable, also rate as an average film of the kind, so: <br /> <br /> 4/10
