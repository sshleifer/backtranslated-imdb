The first half went well, but the last half was really disappointed. It's funny, the producers even admitted that they did not have the slightest idea of ​​the end, and it really shows. What is really sad is that I have to write a minimum of ten lines of comment to be able to post this. I really did not want to include spoilers to qualify my words because the series is not worth it. When Battlestar galatica was released for the first time, I was really excited about the prospect of a better remake, it did not happen that the first season is limited to pornography in space. They ended up cleaning a little and had a fair enough drama, so I started to watch again. But ending the show with kara being an angel god of cyclon, same thing for Baltar and six was rather stupid.
