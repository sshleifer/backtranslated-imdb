The only reason I watched the movie until the end was "hope" to see something interesting. The film is really bad and the girl's performances are really bad, honestly, I'm neither a film critic nor an expert, but you just need common sense to find that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <The first thing that came to my mind when she started to talk was, "She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and he agreed to help her with the script and appear in her film because she is the brilliant director ". .. surprise, surprise, the next day after watching the film, I discovered on the Internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Horrible history and terrible performance.
