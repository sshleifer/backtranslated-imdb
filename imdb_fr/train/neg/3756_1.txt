It's really that bad of a movie. My boyfriend praised him because he's an idiot. But again, I must also be an idiot because I've watched everything! The actors were on par with the geeks of high school theater who think that it will go. The only place they will go is to go back to the waiting table at Luby's. All I could think of as I looked at this "jewel" was the way it was made. I mean, some "writers" actually thought this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then, a jerk with money so much believed in the scenario that he decided to shell out money thinking about the false and naive idea that he was going to profit from it. The actors were chosen, places were spotted, makeup artists were hired, computer animators recently graduated from the Al Collins Graphic School were recruited and this shit began to take shape. <br /> Things I hated about this move, but the craziest thing that made me the craziest was the overuse of music. Every minute of this movie has been marked. There was not a single pause in the music. And sometimes, it was mixed up above the dialogue, not that it made you lose an essential element of the plot or anything. <br /> <br /> After it's over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit before switching to a BMW 740il. You could not get two other opposing films in terms of quality.
