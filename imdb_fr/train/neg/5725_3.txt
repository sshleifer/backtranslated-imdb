2005 gave us the very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; a not so decent scam of the hostel. Live Feed follows roughly the same formula as Eli Roth's previous film, except that this time, idiot children are in Asia rather than Central Europe. The plot focuses on these idiotic kids, and one of them has bothered one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The inhabitants decide to lock them all in a theater and kill them. Despite the fact that I had heard less than favorable things about this film before seeing it, I still hoped it would be at least half decent, because the director Ryan Nicholson had already made the very decent film of 45 minutes on rape and revenge "Torched", but this film falls simply because most of them are either ridiculous or boring. It is obvious that the film is trying to get back to Grindhouse's good old cinema (which the hostel has managed to do), but it has not really disappeared. Surprisingly, if you look at Nicholson's previous work for special effects, even the gore is not impressive ... even though it's way better than acting! I can not say much else about this film ... it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!
