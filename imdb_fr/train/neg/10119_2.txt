The animation of this new image of Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but after 29 minutes, the film causes sleep. They should have called it "Peter & the Snails" because everything moves at a snail's pace. I could not even watch the movie in one sitting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this movie - and you'll thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscars Nominating Committee only looked at the first minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner of the category Best Short Animated Short (Short!), Voters will have to sit back. I'm already sorry for them - and I have to predict that there is no chance this movie wins.
