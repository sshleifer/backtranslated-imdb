It must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that such a bad screenplay has been allowed to become a film and that it will be screened in theaters as recently as 2006. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many sponsored products visible in one movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why so many known actors have even thought that the idea was even visible in a film like this one. If I had respect for some of the actors known in this movie before I saw it, he left for the moment. <br /> <br /> I heard that there would be a follow-up film on this one and I do not understand how it's even possible.
