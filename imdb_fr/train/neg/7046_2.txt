I saw this boring time wasting on HBO's Comedy Channel. So I assumed quite innocently and obviously that it was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is essentially wasted in a scenario that I could have written with my left cheek, after having defeated him insane by the torturers of the fifteenth century inquisition. The first half is particularly bad, because it contains some of the most bland and useless dialogues I've seen in a while and a zero comma plot itself. The mere fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little film and yet, this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. Some beautiful pictures of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film that is made just because its authors have good relationships (family relations, preferably) and / or a lot of trailing money.
