The progression of the plot is enough to "sneak" and arouse curiosity about the result. However, in the end, the lingering feeling is that the film's producers have forgotten to stop their comments. If the intention was to create a perpetual circle (occasionally in the Twilight Zone), it was too careless to be considered a positive effort.
