"National Lampoon goes to the movies" (1981) is undoubtedly the worst film of all time, even exceeding "Plan 9 of outer space". The Lampoon movie is set in three separate and unrelated vignettes, each featuring different performers. The only common denominator is the total absence of redemptive qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site said that fleeting naked shots are good, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry are nicely allocating their assets, respectively in the first and second parts. But their glamorous demonstrations are, alas, ruined. The filmmakers seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible story to surround themselves with and that there is none in sight. <br /> <br /> The third segment, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice at the end of this film. Benson plays the role of a beaver-hungry young policeman who is preparing for his first day of service and is ready to rid the streets of evil. He is associated with a cynical old cop played by Widmark and when these oil and water partners leave together for their first patrol, we feel a possible redemption of the previous failures of the film. Perhaps the old cynic may be reformed by the sense of duty and loyalty of his new partner. Maybe everything will end well after all. But alas, this film goes straight to the toilet, without redemption, happy end without a consistent history of any kind. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies", I already thought I had already seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly be revealed. Unfortunately, I did not see half of it. <br /> <br />
