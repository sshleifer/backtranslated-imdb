This film is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphic than both, and not as good as it is. It is also slow and predictable enough. we have a new age flavor in the mix and some of these scenes present themselves as a motivational / inspirational sermon. In reality, this film is a mixture of almost everything, even if it is gore, the effects of makeup are not very realistic. In fact, they look rather cheap. Aside from all that, there are really terrible clich√© dialogues. And I will not say when, but there is a moment when some of the character's actions were not authentic or credible, given the circumstances. a sensible person would not act that way. as soon as you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean. There is also free nudity for nudity reasons. It was just not necessary at all. The good news was actually pretty good. Better than this film deserves So, after carefully weighing the evidence, I would say that this film was passable, but not good. My verdict for The Tooth Fairy: 4/10
