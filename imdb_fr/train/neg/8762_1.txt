A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) discovers how to bring the dead back to life. However, they come back with marble faces. Eventually, all of this leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> Boring and totally predictable outing of the 1940s. It scared me stupid when I was a child, but it bothers me now. I had to struggle to stay awake! With one exception, the acting is horrible. These actors without boring expression! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it: Carradine, despite the script, gives a very good performance. And there are some slightly scary moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane running through the walls. There is also one of the worst results in the history of cinema. Yet none of this is fun enough to get through this. To avoid.
