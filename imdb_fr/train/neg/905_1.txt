An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) falls pregnant with a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He proposes to marry her by obligation, but she refuses and decides to raise her alone. Things are going well until the child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things get progressively worse (and predictably). <br /> <br /> I saw the silent version and the sound version of "Stella Dallas". Neither of them affected me much (and I cry easily), but they were well done if they were dated. Trying to do it again in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I imagine that Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" to get there. This (predictable) bombed. The story is laughable and dated by today's standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado are performing well, this movie really hangs out and I got bored at the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (two good actors) do not help secondary roles. Fragile and dull. Really - who thought it would work? See the 1937 version of Stanwyck instead. I give this a 1.
