"Private Practice" is getting rid of "Gray's Anatomy", which has been a success and is well written. The cast is fabulous. The premise could even work. But the writing is just terrible. <br /> <br /> The pre-pilot disguised as Gray's anatomy episode should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a stroke of luck. So, I set the DVR to record the driver and all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> As I watched the pilot, I wondered how a show with such a cast of quality actors could bring a boring pilot together. The pilot is supposed to suck people up and make them come back for more. There must be excitement, flash, excellent writing, a fascinating plot with a cliffhanger that must be answered throughout the season. Surprisingly, this series had none of that. <br /> <br /> Thinking it was a coincidence, I just watched the second episode in the hope of the best. And although it is slightly better, it is not close to what must be interesting, it should not miss the television. <br /> <br /> I just crossed out this show from my list of watching shows. Not worth the effort IMO, and I would be very surprised if this show even manages to cross the mid-season. Pass this one to people.
