Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now, with this mix of great talent, you'd think this movie would have been a real party. It could not be further from that. Massacre appears as one of the most boring slasher films I have ever seen coming out of Italian cinema. I had trouble staying awake during the movie and I never had this problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> Massacre begins with a hooker massacred at the edge of the road with an ax. This scene was used in the nightmare concert of Fulci. This is not a bad scene and it increases your expectations of the film as an ax massacre. Unfortunately, the next hour of the movie is so boring. The film goes to a horror film being shot and there is a lot of character development in all these scenes, but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly played that your interest starts to flee. The last 30 minutes of the film are not so bad but could have been much better. The gore in the film was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes of Nightmare Concert, there was nothing new here. The end of the film left a beautiful turn but there was still much to do and continuity falls to the ground. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good movie but for a real Italian horror maniac (like me) this film is a must because it is very rare. 4/10 stars
