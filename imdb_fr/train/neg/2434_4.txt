A realistic film, of course, except that the characters do not seem to be afraid. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not seem to want to. That's why I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger plays a soldier again. No good thrills, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, it's a good thing. Well filmed. I hate the sequence of helicopters, because only one terrorist kills almost all the group of sailors ... I give ** and a half on *****
