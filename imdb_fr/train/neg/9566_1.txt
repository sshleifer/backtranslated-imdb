I see a lot of movies. I saw the original wargames years ago and I loved them. Computers were still "a big mystery" for most of us and the film was convincing, in its own way. <br /> <br /> This one, however, looks like a small special Wednesday night budget. Total shit, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak that you will not believe it until you see the movie (which I would not recommend in the first place). I can not report an actor who has really done a good job in this movie. But hey, with this scenario, I would have been surprised if someone could do a good job as an actor. Many scenes of clich√©s. Looks like CGI was removed from version 86. <br /> <br /> Well, no, I'm in a bad mood writing about it. DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to lose by watching poor movies.
