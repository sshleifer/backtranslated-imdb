The film released in the early 2000s alongside the MELA in both disasters is so sad to start a millennium with such absurdity <br /> <br /> The film seems to please the 70s but looks like an involuntary comedy for 2000 <br /> <br /> Anyway, some classics of the film: Paresh Rawal, I do not understand laughing at his role or crying Reason: he goes to get his mother in the village, it is when he realizes the secret of Anil he keeps the secret in his belly that becomes big and makes him look pregnant I remember that in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf !!!! like a kid I laughed about it this time but here? <br /> <br /> All the movie is a joke can not explain We have Anil in a double role (an older and younger) and Rekha playing the wife of the older and Raveena the youngers We also rejected Harish while Shakti was playing the son of Aruna Irani who were both fighting against the worst wig <br /> <br /> The direction is out of date The music is bad <br /> <br /> Anil strives to look too old in role younger and too young in the role older but a good effort Rekha is enough, Raveena also is fine Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is good in a cameo
