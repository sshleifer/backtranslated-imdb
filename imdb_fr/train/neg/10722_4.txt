** SPOILERS *** Slow molasses-like mummy film depicting this atonement in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, which must be interrupted to prevent the indigenous population who rebelled at the time from attacking to British rule. <br /> <br /> The superior, the British Captain Storm, Mark Dana, as well as two British soldiers and Mrs. Sylvia Quentin, Diane Brewster, wife of the head, go to this archaeological dig. Robert N. Quentin, George N. Neise, goes to the tomb of the mummy. On the way, Captain Sylvia and her men meet Princess Simira, Ziva Rodann, who looks like the desert. <br /> <br /> Simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life, she does not. Drinking water or being tired, but he also knows what Captain Storm & Co. is looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far as possible from the search of Pharaoh Ra Ha's tomb Tet, as far as possible. <br /> In the funerary chamber of Ra Ha Tet, Robert Quentin and his team of archaeologists, accompanied by his Egyptian guide, Simira's brother, Numar, Alvaro Guillot, had already opened his grave before the Captain Storm can not stop them. Quentin raped Ra Ha Tet's body by asking Dr. Farrady, Guy Prescott, to cut off the bandages. This action on the part of Robert and Dr. Farrady dropped Numar. It turns out later that Numar was somehow possessed by the spirit or soul of Ra Ha Tet who seized his body and aged him, at the rate of 500 years per hour, to become himself a mummy 3,000 years old. <br /> <br /> The film has Numar dressed in what looks like pajamas slipping around the tomb of Ra Ha Tet and his surroundings attacking and sucking blood to survive, like a vampire, the man or of the animal in which he enters to contact with. This bloody adventure of Numar, who then loses his right arm, lasts for some time, until Quentin, gone mad, tries to find the entrance, you actually thought he had already found, at the Ra Ha Tet slain killed is an indoor rock slide. <br /> <br /> We learn at the end of the film that Numar, to the surprise of all, is actually a Ra Ha Tet reincarnated in another, some 3000 years later, no one or life. The mysterious and sexy Simira, Numar's sister, is not only the sister of Ra Ha Tet, since Numar and he are really one and the same person, but also the goddess of Egyptian cats Babesti! Not so difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> With Numar / Ra Ha Tet in his grave and all the deaths due to the fate of Pharaoh, Capt Storm Sylvia and all that remains of his death are now complete. his men and the archeological expedition of the late Robert Quentin return to Cairo and return to modern civilization in 1902. The survivors of Pharaoh Ra Ha Tet Curse keep what they found and uncovered only for themselves, because nobody would believe them anyway.
