It's a low-budget spoof of the spy genre. To help you define your expectations, know that: (1) The acting is extremely hard. The stars have a lot of fun playing their lines with excessive eye movements, frequent hand gestures and discreet stimulation. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Often, the lines are abruptly discordant and humorous, because they have absolutely nothing to do with the elements of the previous plot. (3) Plans are often framed in unbalanced angles, making fun of gender excesses. (4) Jeff Goldblum, a man with broken eyes, delivers a complex and sordid dialogue in a sarcastic way. <br /> <br /> The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately departing from an element of the plot stolen from the 1930s B movies: a secret code with a structure that defies Carl Sagan's explanation. The movie film is used mainly for comic effects during the first 90 minutes. As soon as possible, Fay Grim's son, Ned, is so often ordered to leave that you can not help laughing while feeling pity for the boy. The fall of Parker Posey's nicely choreographed bed also helps to put a humorous twist on the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The slow pace of the film does not highlight the elements of comedy or drama that emerge thereafter. The impact of the film as a drama is considerably mitigated by the first comedy. Moreover, it is difficult to be too involved in the characters and their destiny when the first parts of the film are so sarcastic. The score is intentionally heavy, and I found this (and off-camera angles) more irritating than humorous. <br /> <br /> The delusional act, the implausible plot and almost incomprehensible / against conspiracies, and the slow pace will creak a lot of viewers. The movie is much too long at 158 ​​minutes. <br /> <br /> However, fans who are receptive to the sarcasm of the movie may want to watch again ... using subtitles to capture the intelligent ridicule of the dialogue. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm seemed harder than light. But, comedy might please your tastes. The film is worth the detour for independent film fans, fans of director Hal Harley or followers of Parker Posey (who has the most time spent in front of the camera).
