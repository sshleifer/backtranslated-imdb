I can not believe it, IMDb really has every TV show known to man! I have not seen this show for more than 20 years. I only remember two episodes, and I hardly remember it. I remember that Tony may not have been around since the beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is the one everyone tries to get Tony in, but he rejects them, but he usually becomes member of the series at the end of the series. Power House, with everyone applauds. <br /> <br /> The other one I remember is the one where Lolo claims for some reason to be dead (with funerals and people in mourning). I do not remember why he plays dead, nor how the series ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those series that I convinced myself to have dreamed because no one had ever heard of it.
