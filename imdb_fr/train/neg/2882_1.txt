This film is the biggest steam pile of all you know, being from Wichita, Kansas, and growing up there; I know that 90% of the film was Bogus. Apart from the names of some of the victims, nothing else was accurate. Looks like the movie was done with Daddy's handy camera. It contained footage of another film, as well as archive footage of a slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but because of the bad acting, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very dull and very short end. I recommend you not to waste your money on this movie or you will be sorry. eat
