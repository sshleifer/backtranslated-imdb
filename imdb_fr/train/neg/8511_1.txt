For my life, I could not follow, understand or understand the story. As the plot progresses, it is also incomprehensible. I will guess and say that there was a problem of pre-production story / plot that was never solved. Producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, had the time and space to create the other idea, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and his prosecution by the police. They ended up with too many things in a time limit movie forbidden. Too bad because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things and excellent cinematography. In fact, a well done movie that one could enjoy and relax for a few hours.
