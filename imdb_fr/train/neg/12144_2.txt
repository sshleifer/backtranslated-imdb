Although nothing can compare to Vampires vs. Zombies ... in all areas of shooting, I will try to judge this film. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breathtaking. When there was an explosion on the television screen, I thought that all my house would explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me . Simply amazing my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene where Jack Black's sound sounds like the worst monologue I've ever heard almost killed himself, but do not worry, he was the victim of an explosion. the film, he can spend his terrible act on "I must be high". Seriously, he must have watched himself stupidly chatting about unconscious thoughts that have absolutely no meaning and just added that he must be "high" to justify his terrible act. Well, if you can say that to excuse a terrible game, then if you talk to writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you will probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked not to put a sawed-off shotgun in my mouth and I ended my days after death of this terrible excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, then you should be assassinated <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> The General
