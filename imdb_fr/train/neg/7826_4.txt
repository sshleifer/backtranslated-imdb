Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. No land. No depth. No Sens. This film made Superman a meaningless hero, a hero without an archetype. In the original film, he represented America during the Cold War. Here he represented only a Hulk. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among others. <br /> <br /> This still does not solve the problem of lack of depth of this film. I do not see how anyone can draw anything meaningful from this film, while Superman was and is created daily to be a significant hero in comics but also in people's minds. It was a real waste of money given the number of directions this film could have taken. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of world corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and so on. and on. He was just another silly incarnation of Hackman. <br /> <br /> And Superman? What did he do in this movie? Another pirate "savior". <br /> <br /> Wait until he arrives at the theater of dollars, if you see him.
