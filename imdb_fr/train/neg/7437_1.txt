This film is simply not worth the time or the money spent. Full of clich√©s and a plot that makes no sense! I can not believe that so many people have given this horrible movie a rating of 10. I imagine they are the director's stooges. <br /> <br /> If I could give this film a zero, I would do it. Too bad, IMDb does not allow it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I looked at her because I went with a friend who really wanted to see him. What is sad is that I had never had great expectations from this film and yet I felt completely changed. Take my word, do not waste your $ 8 on this trash. The only entertainment I got out of the movie was to make fun of the director's name. In all, very inadvisable!
