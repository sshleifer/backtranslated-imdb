I've seen bad movies before, but this one wins by far the price of the "worst movie of a lifetime"! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill so that his name is associated with it - anywhere! I will never see another film with him in it, staging it, etc., etc.! I can not believe the other actors and actresses I liked (in this photo), who stooped so low to be part of this disaster! There must be good drugs there! For anyone not to be embarrassed to be part of such a film, it exceeds me! Save your money on this one! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr. Hopkins! Shame on Christian Slater too! I can not believe that you put your reputation at stake for this one!
