It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually rent all movies for some aspect of their production, but the extremely irritating behavior of more than half of the characters made it difficult for me. any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Most often, it was the conclusion that the man who designed the building was at fault, an avalanche collapsed. Er ok. <br /> <br /> Also, trying to ski an avalanche slalom style will not work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. Alas it is the case here. As mentioned before, the innate stupidity and sheer stupidity of some characters are ridiculous. In a confined space, with limited oxygen intake, a four-year-old might tell you that lighting a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the film is redeemed and acquires a little appreciation. However, if you have a minimum of intelligence, you will find that most of this movie is hard to tolerate. <br /> <br /> It pains me that so many quality stories are not produced and that, nevertheless, someone pays for such things done. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Well, to give you a hook, you have to keep watching to see the latest avalanche control techniques. Absolutely priceless.
