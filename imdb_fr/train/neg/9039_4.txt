A noble effort, I suppose, but ultimately a poor one. Before I saw this movie, I thought "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was impossible to film. After seeing it, I still do it. Unfortunately, I think that only those who have read the story will understand what is happening and they will be upset by unnecessary revisions of the film (updates from 1850 to 1970, New York to London). Even the great talents of Paul Scofield can not save what seems to me to be an ill-intentioned but misguided effort to turn Melville's metaphysical classic.
