This film is not only a very bad film, with dreadful actors - or alleged actors -, a boring direction and an unattractive story, it also copies a scene of the excellent "giallio" "Torso", directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years ago), one of the most famous psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult movie around the world. In "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director retransmits the scene of the bed between the black girl and the white girl, watched from a window through the window of the room. Of course, the scene in Rizzo's film is ridiculous and inferior to the sweetness and charm of Martino's film. Put another black girl, another white girl and another voyeur replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way to prove that the film Rizzo has no ideas, no originality, no taste and nothing at all. I think such things offend the audience.
