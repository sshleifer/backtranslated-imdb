Alas, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you that this version sucks! I do not know who of everyone has put money for this flotsam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic piece and made it the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version is literally so bad that even the presence of a big spy like Maximilian Schell in the lead role can not save her. The only quality that redeems this film is to have made a great food for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow had fun with this one. <br /> <br /> But anyway, I'm sure Shakespeare, if he had been alive when they created this, would not have wanted his name to be associated with him. This "hamlet" is not even so bad that it's good; it's just bad. Absolutely terrible.
