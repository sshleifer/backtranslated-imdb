Let me start by saying that I can appreciate just about any bad Italian horror film or 1970s jungle movie. Seriously. This one was downright awful. <br /> <br /> There are far too many items that Martino tries to inject and none of them work (except the wild-hooked thing) at all. There are, of course, ignorant Westerners who have created a hotel in the jungle somewhere. I do not even remember where this happens ... how sad is it ... Basically, people come to the complex to see this indigenous tribe and its ceremonies, but end up upsetting the "God alligator" of the river who unleashes an outburst, killing vacationers and some members of the tribe. Sounds good, yes? Well, do not hope. The violence is minimal until the end, the special effects are so bad that it was as if a kindergarten class had performed them and the love story told is laughable. <br /> <br /> There are seriously scenes where he appears to mount a camera underwater in a pool and throws a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and is supposed to be the attacking striker . I am not joking. In another wonderfully designed special effect, a Matchbox pickup truck is targeted by the incredible flowing plastic gator, which suddenly has five times the size of a pickup truck. (A few minutes ago, he was just big enough to eat a human, but now he's crushing a van ...) It's really pathetic. The only other film that I can think of where the effects were so serious that I got out of the story is Bruno Mattei's masterpiece, "Rats," with the plastic rats on the treadmill and all those who CAN NOT be terrified. /> <br /> Normally, I would say anything Sergio Martino was a must see, but this one is a must-pass. Time wasted and certainly not worth buying for the $ 15 + No Shame sticker. This one is a shame. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10, children.
