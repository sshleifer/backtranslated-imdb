When I saw this trailer on television, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and it was like a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that the seats move). I guess the version I saw was an abbreviated version (15 min.) And also recreated to add motion effects. It was a cute movie ... but that was it. It was informative and the first mission was told, but the end of an outing into the CGI space seemed a bit ... well ... banal. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to any parent wishing to inform their kids in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I will say that the actors were well chosen and that the characters themselves were cute. So I would say that if you want to bring the youngest children ... go ahead. But if you want to bring your older kids, bring them to another movie ... they'll thank you.
