Why would a legitimate actor who read the script have participated in this story? God, it's embarrassing to look at him. I can not imagine the shame these people must feel to be part of it. In addition, there would seem to be controversy over whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was not credited, but his list of roles (IMDB) recognizes him. BTW ... Rain is her sister for those who asked before. This film is proof that no matter how many big names you have. Sow's ears do not make silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe one day someone can explain to me the reason for this kind of film. He has no endearing, entertaining, or even comical property compared to his bad everything else.
