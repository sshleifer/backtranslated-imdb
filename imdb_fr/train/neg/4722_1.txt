Do not watch this Serbian documentary and propaganda on the lookout for this documentary and you'll see the facts and the truth. Http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> The documentary series The death of Yugoslavia (five episodes) is a meticulously compiled and documented account of the vast bloodbath that marked the end of the former federal Yugoslavia and touched most of the first half of the 1990s. It includes a huge amount reports and interviews with both Yugoslav and other parties involved. The only real "improvement" that could be made to this incredible achievement would be the inclusion of further developments in the Balkans since the program's inception. This was actually done in the late 1990s for a new broadcast on BBC television, but the addition of some even more recent events would help complete this admirably detailed and comprehensive work. Maybe another whole episode could be justified? The very brief title of this documentary was made even more appropriate by the eventual abandonment of the term "Yugoslavia" by the now-named Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a late and formal admission of that which had occurred years ago. <Br /> <br /> not a fiction as in "Yugoslavia: The Avoidable War (1999)"
