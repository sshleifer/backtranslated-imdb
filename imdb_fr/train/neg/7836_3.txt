The first episode set the bar high enough, I thought. He starred William Hurt as a hitman who is forced to kill a toy maker. We are given very little information about his character or the person who pays him to kill him, indeed, this episode is characterized by the total absence of dialogue. Back in his modern apartment, he receives a package containing toy soldiers. This gives him a smile, but he rejects it and goes about his business. But he is plunged into a hell of a night, the soldiers are alive and on the verge of war, driving jeeps, firing machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show and it becomes very tense as he walks through the apartment using his mind to survive, sometimes taking over and sometimes not. I will not spoil the end, but I'll just say it was a clever little trick. It gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were dirt and I lost interest in the fourth. Stephen King's adaptations are always mixed and are no exception.
