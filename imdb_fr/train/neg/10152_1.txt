As a fan of horror movies, I saw this in my video store and thought I'd try it. Now that I have seen it, I wish it no living soul on the planet. I take advantage of the free rental of my film and I feel not to get my money. I've seen horror movies that were bad in my day, but I'm a fan of them, but that was just an insult.
