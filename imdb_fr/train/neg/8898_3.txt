Can fake landscapes ruin a photo? You would not think so, but it's really for me here. Listen, I have a lot of classic movies and I know pretty much what it takes except, like pilots driving stationary cars in front of a screen, and so on. But much of this hokey story is about action scenes. Having false landscapes, fake mountains and flowers, one after another, as seen in "Brigadoon", becomes insulting after a while. <br /> <br /> As for musical entertainment, it is always subjective. What songs one person likes, another one can not, so it should not be an important part of judging a movie (that someone likes songs). I could blow up this film for its 1950s nerdy songs, dances, novels and characters, but it was in the 50s and many people liked that stuff. The musicals performed very well in the 50s. I loved the 30's and 40's with the big taps. In the 50s, the cock was out and this new stuff - which I can handle - was. Is it a lousy film? No. This makes it just one that does not bother me too much <br /> <br /> Despite the good distribution, the good director and great expectations, this movie was bombarded at the box office and with me. I would have liked to be more dreamy and that's a nice part of this story. I am not cynical and a beautiful city and nice people making me feel good awful. So why could not I connect with this movie? Part of that was dancing too. I do not care about anything that has replaced taps on the screen. But - no - the thing really upset me. There was no Scotland, no uplands, just a hokey-looking background to make it look like that, and it almost changed me from the beginning. Score a point for today's realism, where they "move" most of the time.
