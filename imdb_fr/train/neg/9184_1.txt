F * ck me! I have seen incredibly horrible movies in my day, but it is important to me! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not express in words how bad this movie really is. In addition to the intrigue that does not really exist, comic play, hilarious excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this movie is either stupid, useless, crap or embarrassing. I express to who wants to watch this film ... no! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say it, I have this on my support. He is hidden at the bottom of this sacred pile. I could not even give this horse an excuse for a movie. That's how bad it is.
