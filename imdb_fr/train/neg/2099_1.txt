WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (you do not have to worry about it) Sorry for the capital letters.) <br /> <br /> Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that is all the more boring as nonsense, it continues with foolishness and useless dramas. It's bad, but precisely. <br /> <br /> We know that traveling in space is a risky business. There is a complex system with many risks of dysfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc., and unexpected events will inevitably occur in largely unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, things had gone wrong. It's called learning. While Appollo 11 was not sure by today's standards and the political pressure was immense, the overall performance of the technology used for the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Assortment of errors / comments, I did not even have to look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh. That's what I would have done. After all, it was the culmination of a propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives the green light although Appollo 11 is probably exploding. (It's "only" implicit, though.) Yeah, that's why they leave people and hurry to watch in near real time. <br /> <br /> 3) Ejection of the capsule would not work. As if it did not work the time a chimpanzee was in it. Who survived? It was a launch test and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. There is a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look for it somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) A guy interviewed said that an explosion would have destroyed much of Florida. I can only assume it was a hyperbole, because otherwise I'm just amazed at how wrong he could be. <br /> <br /> 5) The technology was then primitive compared to current standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware are used even today because they do not have to plant. This is even worse for spacecraft because their computers need to be built with components of comparable size that are not sensitive to radiation. (And the ship itself must be manually manageable anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2 would not be suitable.) What about the fact that they used "television screens" rather than "computer screens"? It's the same technology. In fact, television screens have been and are produced with a significantly higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object was not part of the rocket, it could only be one thing." We see where it goes. Aside from the fact that the statement is false, who said it was not a rocket? At least one interviewee states that if something steals and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) The voiceover as well as erroneous quotes make it seem that the lander's radiation film was actually its hull. Which would make it thinner than a spacesuit. <br /> <br /> 8) The impending death of Neil Armstrong during a training flight is a sequence I can appreciate; I had not seen him before. As I said, any manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it has not been sufficiently tested, because it is unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The trajectory deviation of the descending undercarriage (due to irregularities in the density of the moon) has never been a serious threat to life. Neither did the "fifteen seconds of fuel" remain, which was actually "fifteen seconds of fuel before having to cancel the mission and return to the control module". <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophic chain of events" usually leads to a catastrophe. I really do not know how to say it more simply. This, however, is an excellent example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a short sequence of one astronaut walking and aimlessly jumping like a gleeful kid, followed by a voiceover telling us that the reason for this strange behavior "can now be revealed ". It turned out he was walking and hopped aimlessly like a happy kid. Hilarious hints. <br /> <br /> 12) It was mentioned that at the start of the school year, all contact was lost. It is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time that it is impossible to circumvent it with contemporary technology. Here again, the seriousness of this situation is implicit, but very voluntarily. <br /> <br /> 13) No shuttle has ever been lost in space itself, while the voiceover presents this "fact" as proof that Appollo 11 was a pile of shit. Appollo 13 was a near-loss, but the two real catastrophes occurred during take-off and reentry, respectively. Anyway, comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is kind of ... well, all right, just stupid. Even ignoring this, successful shuttle missions do not seem to have been deemed of interest to the public. <br /> <br /> 14) What's up with the UFO? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was done for entertainment purposes, intended for a specific audience (which seems to include people who hardly understand history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the purpose of the film is a little obscure. Phrases like "covered so far", "publicly revealed here for the first time", appear, but the film does not blame, offers no lesson or anything that could be expected from a movie also emotionally realized. . In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are many snapshots of interviews and recordings that are often out of context or with people we only know as the "NASA Scientist". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the effort? Want that? What does this have to do with the purpose of the film again? Oh yes, what a point. <br /> <br /> In summary, in addition to being inaccurately voluntary or incompetent, it's not even a good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who loves his crappy documentaries. this film is not funny, spiritual, picturesque, it's nothing.
