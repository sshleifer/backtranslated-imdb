This effort resembled a glitzy TV movie ... I do not remember going out to theaters ... If so, he had to die a quick death. Watching the DVD, in the comfort of our room, it was obvious that this film was not intended for anything else ... Ed Lauter, art critic with a thirst for greed? What a fun ride it must have been ... I have not seen Ed since "The Longest Yard" ... All the others have played the numbers, led by Baldwin, with the exception of Pompeo ... She does not had no charisma. and she seemed sleepy through most of the photo ... Pompeo's daughter had only one dimension ... she played every scene like an adorable little puppy ... the slowest queue of all 3-year-olds that I've never seen ... The chase scenes gave my wife and myself a headache ... too many fast cuts and unevenness ... If you want to shoot a scene of pursuit in Barcelona, ​​you might want some WIDE shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop, right? The whole story was rather implausible and far-fetched, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
