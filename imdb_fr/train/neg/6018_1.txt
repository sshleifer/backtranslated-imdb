I find it sad that Christians (and I am one) believe that we have to make movies like "Left Behind". We have better stories to tell that should not be so predictive. I was very disappointed with this movie. As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example of what I will not do in my film career.
