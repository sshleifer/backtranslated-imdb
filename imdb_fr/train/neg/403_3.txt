Another violent and angry fantasy of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it is difficult to say whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or if he operates in total oblivion. He also seems to completely ignore the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and some of them exceptional) can not hide a neglect of history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a friendly actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild ') to try to compensate for his childlike appearance; However, given the material, Bacon is not hateful enough to oblige. The other directors are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, who have neither the talent necessary to make a good impression, but who, forced to hold a senseless dialogue, are embarrassed. The culmination is a study in preponderance and unbelief must be truly suspended.
