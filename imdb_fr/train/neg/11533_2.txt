If the derivative and predictable thrillers of rape revenge are your thing, then you will enjoy a rare feast ... They do not really interest me, so I could not find anything that redeems this particular tale. It sounds like something that comes right out of the 1980s, at a different age where it would go directly to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are working well with a weak scenario and a tedious scenario. But what does Gillian Anderson do in a film like this after the brilliant success of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the Bleak House TV adaptation on the BBC last year? The director would have been influenced by the fact that he would have attended a near-rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that is not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hunting dogs hit Dyer . I do not think I was the only person in the cinema to laugh. What I do not understand is the participation of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great British independent films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to do with your artistic judgment? It's a big stain on your two reputations. Listen: do you hear thousands of independent British film fans crying in despair?
