Unbelievable. Is it getting dumber? No chance. The stupidity of this movie would be ashamed even to Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had a mediocre dialogue and the second part had a bad one, then this one has a moronic dialogue. Unbelievable. But this time, the story has also been reduced to the level of dialogue. Despite the acting and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise. The absolutely stupid plot obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated left winger. <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder if these leftists themselves realize how anti-democratic and pro-dictatorship they are. In this movie, they obviously target the United States? a democracy. Why do not they target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc.? in anti-military films? Of course, most of these places are unlikely to produce such a cube in the near future, but that's not the question. It's obvious: waste writers like this admire these kinds of diets, whether they are aware of it or not. I would go so far as to say that ANYONE who constantly attacks US foreign policy has anti-democratic beliefs at its center. <br /> <br /> Back to the film: in addition to being as far-fetched as it is even more funny, the film presents many obvious inconsistencies. For example, for some reason, the two men who supervise the cube did so for a while and are unaware of the pain and sadism involved in the project. Yet, the first to suddenly turn against the system! Anyone who has an idea of ​​human nature will understand this idiocy well. Or what about that moron, that one-eyed, evil bureaucrat who talks like he's in a bad comedy of Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses ANY serious and therefore any chance of being exciting: it really becomes a comedy.
