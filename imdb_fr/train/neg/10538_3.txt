The First Power (1990) is a terrible movie released in the late '80s and early' 90s with inexpensive horror movies. I found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some places. This film lacks so much sense and credibility that it's not even funny. The fast judicial system of this film makes Texas look weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is above his head with this role (he plays a hard policeman) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's most seductive sister) plays the role of a medium. Do not waste your time with this one because it's bad. What a minute, I repeat it. This film makes a big party movie. Take a look at the crucifix that fills her satchel with the crucifix, she has the most enjoyable legs I've ever seen on a nun who did not appear in a Jesus Franco nunsploitation film. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This marked the end of an era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished and he could not attract flies to a pile of excrement. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resurrection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you are desperate.
