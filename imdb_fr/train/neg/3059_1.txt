Very recently, I had the chance to praise this and watch Santa Claus win martens. Although children are much more sadistic in SCCTM, I must say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. In Spanish, we all had to watch it. I'll tell you that in general, when we watch a movie, we're just talking and eating food, but not for that movie. Everyone gaped, wondering what the devilish Mr. Pitch was going to do. Would Merlin help Santa!?! or his reindeer robot would he save the day? I would suggest renting it because it's the biggest waste I've ever seen and I love it. :RE
