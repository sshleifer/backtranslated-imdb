What is * bliep * with this movie? Could not they create a better scenario? All in all, it's a "nice" film, but ... it's been done more than once ... Until the end, I thought everything was fine, but ... back in the past ... * barf * SI corny ... waited for the fairy mother lady to appear ... but wow, it did not happen ... which is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but to such a movie in a new form with another child who wanted to be older / bigger; it's so simple <br /> <br /> Just watch until the film goes on TV. Do not get me wrong, but that's not all that
