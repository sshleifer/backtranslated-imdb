..Oh wait, I can! This film is not suitable for the typical movie snob unless you want to go deeper into your typical movie definitions, such as "streaming" and "geographical matching". I could not tell where I was in this movie. One second, they are in the present, the minute after their so-called in the 70s driving a modern SUV and wearing what seemed to me to be an 80's style outfit. I think. I could not pay enough attention because the acting was awful. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D image that I did not watch. If you are a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean bad movie, then this movie is for you. It's a homemade movie and any meaningless style will make you laugh as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, just ignore this one.
