In a film that follows an actor in difficulty, played, obviously, by a troubled actor, it does not favor Chris Klein. He has trouble bringing anything memorable to his role and continues to roll through the shallow script that manages to display, which can only be described as a bland ruler. The story exists, but that's all, and does not show the beginning, the middle and the end base, and the viewer shrugs, feeling that nothing has happened in the last three quarter past one. > Fred Durst stands out from his seemingly moderately talented co-stars and does an almost decent job to bring the backstage character of Legde back to life. That Fred can recreate that when working with a cast of higher caliber remains to be seen, but I will monitor it in the future.
