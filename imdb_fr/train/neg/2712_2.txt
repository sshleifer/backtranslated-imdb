The 60's is an occasionally entertaining film. Most of this entertainment comes from the film's laughter. It is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements. Take for example the transition between black and white and color. If done right, it could have been quite effective, but because it was done wrong, it turned into a nuisance and only hurt the already bad experience; a lot of the movie had a strange feeling. The acting was not bad for a movie made for television, but again, it was downright embarrassing at other times. Most events were not consistent and ended up being confusing. How did this family end up in most major events of the 1960s? The end was far too severe for my taste; because it was Hollywoodized, everything had to turn in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time on the 60's and do anything else with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class, and not in my spare time. I think I can say that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my disjointed thoughts about the movie. I hope you follow my advice and stay away from this.
