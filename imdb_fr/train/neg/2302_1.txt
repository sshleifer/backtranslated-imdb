Listen to some of the interesting things that our healer Pat, our son, his son Gordon (the TV Department looks like a family run business) and Terry Meeuwsen (Won Miss America in 1973 wearing a swimsuit and showing off his legs. Oh, my God, thank you!) Say when our poor viewers are sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with a "right abscess tooth" has just been cured.2. Someone with "crooked intestines" has been cured.3. Then Terry said that there was a person with a "strange condition", (you mean God does not know?) A burn to the legs, which has just been healed. Then Gordon said that there was a man (which reduces him!) With a sinus swelling on the right cheek, with a lot of pain behind the right eye, but he is now healed.5.Someone with a problematic right hip, limited mobility stroke, is now able to walk. 6. Terry said she had seen someone with severe stiff neck, but she did not know the exact condition (God does not know?) - that this person was now healed. 7. Someone paralyzed on the right side, especially (Not quite ?!) The right side of the face is now healed.8. A man (who is still reducing the world's population) with a plaque in his skull has ongoing problems and doctors simply do not know what to do. Terry said she had seen the bone reform around the plate (the funny bone ?!) and that the man's pain was gone, he was now healed. <br /> <br /> This is how our war hero Pat helps our sick and our poor. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but it reduces it a lot). She has a sinus that the Lord is drying out, now, thank you Jesus. 2. There is a man with a financial need - I think a hundred thousand dollars. (I think their god needs to go to school or something!) This need is satisfied right now, and in three days money will be provided by the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit. Thank you Jesus. 3. There is a woman in Cincinnati with cancer of the lymph nodes. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this has already been diagnosed (ask your vengeful god Pat!) but you do not feel well and the Lord is dissolving this cancer right now! (What ?!) 4 There's a lady in Saskatoon (I'm assuming Canada.) In a wheelchair spine curvature, The Lord is straightening him, and you can get up and walk! (If you have this condition, ignore Pat!) It is and it's up to you. Thank you Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff ?, Oral Roberts ?, Benny Hinn ?, Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a REAL PHYSICIAN to get an operation! (You mean he does not trust his faith-healer friends, Terry or his own son Gordon ?!) <br /> <br /> When LT Pat Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean War, he was a liquor officer, responsible for keeping the officers supplied with alcohol. He was known to drink himself and frequent prostitutes and was afraid to contact gonorrhea. (Should seek help from a faith healer!) <br /> <br /> The reason Pat left the fight was because of his dad Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va 1946-1966) was president of the Senate Committee on Military Credits. <br /> <br /> Terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 We imagined ourselves invulnerable and were consumed by the search for health, wealth, between 150 and 200 million dollars!) material pleasures (a manor to Virginia Beach in Virginia with a helicopter launch pad!) And sexuality (he had sex with his future wife before the wedding with which they had a son!). He (terrorism) is happening because God is lifting his protection (Statement published September 13, 2001.) Pat Robertson reminds me Burgermeister in Santa Claus is coming and his evil god reminds me of Venger in Dungeons And Dragons. <br /> <br /> The spoiled kid Gordon does what Papa Pat tells him and Terry is a well paid woman who does not have a clean mind! <br /> <br /> It will really take you! The September 700 edition of The 700 Club included a report by Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent Gary Lane, located outside the New Orleans Convention Center, which had sheltered victims of a black disaster mostly impoverished throughout the weekend. evacuees "Lane said" that they include this voodoo mug with the saying "May the fate be with you." A shot of a plastic souvenir mug from one of New Orleans' countless trinket shops appeared on the screen. "Guerrilla Warfare title and Thugs 'R' Us," said Lane pointing to a stack or rap CDs on the floor. (His bigot dad Absalom taught Racism to Pat!) <br /> <br /> If any of you are sponsoring a softball or basketball team, give it to a food shelf, be a Big brother or big sister, but please, do not give these people because they have been around for over 40 years and nothing has been solved. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe me, type Pat Robertson over your head during the commercial break on the web, click on Search and once you hear what he really likes, I know for sure that you will not give a cent to these menacing liars! And by the way, Terry has already divorced and Pat has often spoken out against divorce in his broadcasts. <br /> <br /> I like to say hello to the people of Dover, Pennsylvania, Orlando, Florida, and the friendly Hurricane Katrina and I hope it will be a nice day. Was Operation Blessing useful in New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Let our readers know! I do! By the way, if you're sick, go to a real doctor and let everyone laugh at these liars. Burgermeister Pat, Gordon and Terry will one day be able to go elsewhere and take their god in anger.
