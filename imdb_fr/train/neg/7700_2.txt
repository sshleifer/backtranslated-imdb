I saw the movie last night at home, but I thought it was too long at first. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were far too textual to have what I thought was a comedy type movie like the others before. Things are not funny in the film: the fiance hits his girlfriend, he is beaten. The movie was way too long - talk about wanting to sleep and wonder when it will end when you wake up and play it again! Some of the things at the meeting were too difficult to capture - like the lady who sings - I felt like I was almost watching a show of spiritual songs here! Come on Perry, you can do better than that!
