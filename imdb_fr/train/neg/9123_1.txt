I do not have much to say about this movie. It could have been a great feat for Peter Sellers, but it's one of the most tragic failures in film history. The final film of Sellers makes the situation even more painful. <br /> <br /> The shocking screenplay, staging and performances of wood are terribly combined to make this movie one of the most horrible films ever. > <br /> I wish so much that I can find even a laugh or a laugh buried somewhere in this pile of rotten fat, but it's a disaster without life and without humor. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why could not you stop at BEING?
