I have never watched a movie in such a short time. The only hello was the fast-forward function on the DVD player. It was like watching a badly produced CBC movie. There was obviously no money for lighting, filming, sets, location, writers, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story either! I need to write ten lines of comments ... Bad, awful, horrible, miserable, scary, tortuous, bilious, nauseous, disgusting, cheese, disgusting, fragile, disgusting, disgusting, stinky, stinky, stinky, nauseating, vile, putrid, all I do not know if I can continue to complete the ten lines of the poor quality of this crap-o-matic production!
