It must be one of the worst villains I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It's slow, boring, amateurish - not even consistent in his own simplistic reading of the plot. The actors do not act. I can not blame them - we've given them such a banal scenario all they can do is run through it with a pain behind the eyes that has nothing to do with the evil events from SummersIsle. /> There is not a moment in this film that sounds right - not an honest line, nor a single moment when one is moved. The character of Nicholas Cage is so badly drawn that one feels no compassion for him through all his tribulations. I did not doubt that I saw a suffering man there, but Nicholas Cage was perfectly aware that he was in the worst film of his career.
