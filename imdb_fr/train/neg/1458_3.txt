The back cover of the DVD (the one that was missed when it was released) features Hitler - The Rise Of Evil - "The New York Post" and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> No matter the post, but really, who has already written this word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of, uh, art must be fired. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start. Why try to paint Hitler's picture of evil with colors that did not exist? He was devilish, but his character is described in a way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the gentle and moderate way in which he treated women) and so on. <br /> <br /> The actors are good, so you have to feel sorry for them because they are imprisoned in their one-dimensional characters. A kind of curse here with Peter O'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career that he ended up playing the role of an old leader missed in a failed film (or in this case a television production, for be precise). The first was of course the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb. So I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> This one is OK if it's on TV and you have nothing else to do, but trust me, it's better to leave it on the shelf in your store Virgin local.
