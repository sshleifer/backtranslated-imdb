Seeing the photo of a man attacked by zombies made me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could be at the height of his old tricks. Unfortunately, except for the close-ups of a decaying corpse, there is nothing in the story of the murder of a rich man and his daughter's quest to find out who killed him. None of the characters are attractive and by the time you find out how they did it (this twist, at least, was cool), you stop getting interested. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert!
