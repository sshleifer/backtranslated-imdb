The premise is incredible and some of the actors, including Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this film is almost unassailable. The music sounds as if it came from a royalty-free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap. Most of the songs are wrong. I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and added some music ... The dialogue is really stupid and banal. The film works best when it talks about real estate, but unfortunately, it often gets lost in stupid secondary intrigues. I found myself watching my watch after the first twenty minutes and after 40 hours wondering "when will it finish?"
