Wrongly, I kept awake late last night watching this thing. The only good thing I can say about this horrible film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure it's characters. The settings were hokey and idiots, and the overuse of split screens was wasted as they sometimes could not even sync with other clips. If I could give it a score of zero or less, I would do it. Unfortunately, it's not even worth laughing for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> This is just a sad example of the money wasted by Hollywood, and now I'm wasting my time thinking about it.
