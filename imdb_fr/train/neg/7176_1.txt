I have nothing more to say but it was awful. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if some actors do not want people to question their sexuality, then they should perhaps refrain from doing more of these movies. There was at least one that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think about what was happening had been cut from the movie. SHUDDER wonders what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. Shuddered to think about the thought process and voyeurism that reigned in the minds of administrators. As I said before, it's a degrading mess. It's not even funny. As Ebert said about the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, not a good story and not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
