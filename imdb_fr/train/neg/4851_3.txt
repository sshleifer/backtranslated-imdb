Watch a team of demining experts in Iraq count the time they have before returning home. <br /> <br /> That in itself is boring. Whenever this little legend told us how long they had left, it caused this film without a plot. hurry up and finish your stay there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I miss something. I am a big fan of war movies if they are well done. This had the jarhead syndrome. A film that has sometimes been beautifully shot, but cinematography does not prevent it from being totally boring and useless. <br /> <br /> And already overcome the slowness of the "cartridges that come out of the rifle". they could have saved money and obtained archive footage of any other film with a gun. <br /> <br /> I had no empathy for the main character, I was constantly hoping that his imprudence would make him die. In fact, the film would have worked much better if it had done so. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and seemed to feel that those in the armed forces did not like that and everyone liked it. I have never been part of the forces and I accompany them. It's pretentious drivel. the 3 stars are for cinematography.
