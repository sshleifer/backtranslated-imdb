It's not a good movie. Too preached in parts and history was under par. The 3D was correct, but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about three young flies who want to live an adventure and follow it up. The characters are missing, I do not really care about these characters and I think there is nothing that could interest an adult. Pixar this is not the case. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. Also, I would like to see more jokes about flies than the mom keeps saying "Lord of flies". Pretty sexist, she shows women as maids and faint.
