I watched this movie after reading other IMDb reviews, even persuading my wife that it was a "unique horror movie". I wanted to love this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> "The love story" was good, but the horror was rather bad. If the story concerned a young man who had fallen in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia, it was a better movie. <br /> <br /> The health center has gone beyond the limits of credulity. was ridiculous enough The doctor happily ignores the privacy and professionalism laws. A nurse goes to a room to regularly feed a dangerous patient (without a security escort), drops the tray and comes out of the room shouting for no apparent reason. The forensic patient (and the villain of the film) is tied up in a fully dressed standing position - apparently for years? It does not mean anything. <br /> <br /> The film even had actors that I liked in other areas, such as detectives, but I still can not recommend this film.
