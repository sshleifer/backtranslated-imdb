A conspiracy that tarnished and stammered irreconcilable differences of opinion was a judgmental disaster with one pro-life side and the other a destroyer of the seed of a demon. The horror was left aside and replaced by a dull general effect that was probably horrible, but revealed a bad dose of belief that ridiculed itself to death, despite the title itself. As a Masters of Horror fan from the beginning, this ridiculous plot with its sordid representations crashed like an old rocking chair after sitting down. I consider that this episode was thrown together from the start, never really taking off only to test it for what it's worth and relieved when it finally came to "The End" ..
