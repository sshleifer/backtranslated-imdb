I saw this at GenCon only because it was quiet and I could take a nap. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Has the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda been busy or something? <br /> <br /> Really, a junk bit of junk. The characters were stereotyped unintentionally (I think ...) and wooden, most of them seemed to be on autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called critics were so commonplace that I cried for writers. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how anyone can find this useful. , seriously. I only give 3 out of 10, because to be a 2 or a, it would take either five hours or more Kelly LeBrock.
