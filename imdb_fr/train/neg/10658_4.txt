On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), the five (attention to us three, hardcore fans of Kamal) had made a unanimous verdict; VV was a fucking shit and thanks to the movie, we were going to have a pretty damn monday. Not to mention us, we swore not to go to the movies next year. <br /> <br /> I do not want to blame Kamal here because he has somehow let slip a hint in a recent interview with the cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). He said something like: "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing, namba munnera'na maadri Scenario, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil cinema has developed in terms of photography and but we have not improved much on the script, the realization and the action. ") As you watch VV, these words resonate like a truth. <br /> <br /> Now, Here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I do not easily remember 'Use swearing here, but HJ has mastered the He's used to screwing up every recent film from his movie (remember' Anniyan ',' Ghajini ') with his discordant cacophony, he bills as a background music. The next time I have a eardrum, it will pay the price. <br /> <4. The songs The songs do not allow to move the narrative of the film in space / time, or require you to sit down and take note of it. The film gives the impression that it is composed of VERY long songs with some scenes n between them. <br /> <br /> 5. A short went too far. At best, VV is meant to be a short story, not a "thriller" of more than 2 hours. To use a snapshot here, like the Energizer Bunny, it goes on and on; only in this case, you do not want it. The last part of a film gives the impression of a big drag. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika Pairing Two rubbed ice cubes could have produced more sparks than this pair of lead. There is no reason you want them to do this together. In fact, each time they find themselves in the second half of the film, they irritate the narrative a lot. I'm sorry to say that, but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10-minute romance does more than Kamal and Jothika realize in this more "Thenali" movie. <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan Kamal's accent has that pretentious accent that no one speaks in India or the United States; and it's not new either. He has been doing this since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It's just annoying. Imagine the damage this can cause when his talent for using this strange accent meets filming in the United States. He does not leave him to Immigration either, he offers advice to his men (TN police officers stunned by Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in Kamste chaste ("What we have here is a bad police wok "), of course with nauseating effect. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic You expect some administrators with a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly with a crappy performance in the common sense department. What D.C.P in his senses would meet his love interest in the streets to discuss issues such as personal commitment and life after! The scene inside the theater was so bad, towards the climax; we could hear the people behind us loudly challenging the hero's IQ. "Is he stupid, can not he just use his siren or his lights?" (On a busy road in Madras, Kamal-the-policeman-in-police-Jeep pursues a guy on a bike like any ordinary guy!). "Can not he just use his weapon?" ("The bike guy" starts walking and we have a fully equipped Kamal hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time). I do not vote in favor of this last point, but I'm just trying to explain the atmosphere inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to see women being raped, their throats slit, more women being raped and throwing in the bushes with excruciating authenticity, I would stay home and would rather look at a "police report" or a "Kuttram". The excessive use of violence should be a way of prolonging the story, not overwhelming it! Somewhere in the year, Gautum seems confused as to the nature of the extensions (rapes, murders) and the nature of the story! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double espresso failed to dispel the pain.
