I hate movies about plane crashes ... ALL! In fact, I hate them all with passion! First of all, they look cheap and have no know-how! Secondly, they insult the airline industry and tell the public that all planes do it, that is ... FALL OF SKY AND CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why do I wince at such a movie? It could happen to any of us and with more serious consequences than those suffered by the characters in this film ... which is the only frightening aspect of an air disaster line like this one. I hate this movie because it's like all the 50,000,000 chaos movies of stupid planes before! The free fall is like any other: nothing more than boredom before bullshit scenes of bullshit bullshit. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the same series of delays on this deadly flying trap: the Cleaver-esquire family of three, the yuppie baastard, and the stewardess bitch accompanied by of a big blonde hairstyle from 1987 scolding anyone who is frightened in the least! <br /> <br /> My second complaint is that this should not be a feature film, but a documentary explaining everything that happened about the Air Canada incident "Gimbli Glider", also called "Freefall", up to safety precautions. <br /> <br /> My third and final complaint concerns all aerial films of this caliber (with the exception of Fearless). Why on earth did the male steward ask passengers to take off their shoes? (I could understand the high heels and the sharp and loose objects, but go!) As if that would make them safer than they are now! This plane, if they (the passengers) did not know it better: knew they were going to land. Why would you force 100 wounded to drop a rubber blade that could peel and bleed the skin on impact, and then walk barefoot over a debris field! Does this make sense to anyone? <br /> <br /> Fearless and the hit ABC series "Lost" have more depth and realism for an air disaster than "simple aircraft malfunctions - panic-stewards become dummies without wheels in a field, people wander without shoes or jackets, etc. The same old shit of Airport 1975! Freefall was so typical of a movie about air accidents that I would almost expect Charlton Heston or Peter Graves to burst in the damn passenger cabin Can we at least see how these ugly characters return to normal life instead of rejoicing in the midst of the impending tragedy that lies before them? Typical movie of the stupid life, Cheap and Stupid! /> <br /> The director of "Freefall" should stick to cheap movies for television with middle-aged white women with stupid kids who use drugs and have marital problems. s uspense ... let the professionals care ... you Why should the public sit for more than an hour and a half? is the wannabe rehash airport. I hope they do not produce such films anymore. If it looked like ABC's "Lost" series, it would be something to watch. But it's total shit and then some. Stop turning all airplane disaster movies into "Airport 1975"! It's not "Airport" it's a pathetic loss not expensive of my time. I would not recommend this movie or any other disaster movie on TV to anyone not even my worst enemies.
