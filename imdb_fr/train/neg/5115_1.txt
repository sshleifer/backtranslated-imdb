It must have been one of the worst films I've ever seen and I'm 64 and I'm a football fan. I went to watch a movie about football. After about 10 minutes, I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie (especially acting) could have entered a theater. About halfway through, I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained the facts behind the film. Although I was a little offended (and know how some might be VERY offended if they were not Christians) to have been preached in a movie theater, it was not such a big deal. However, it was a big problem to be subject to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, to the quality of the acting. It is a suitable film for an exit to the church but which must be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. Am I going to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I attend a movie? Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not!!!
