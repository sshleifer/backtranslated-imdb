If you are the type of person who can enjoy a very bad movie, then I highly recommend it. If you are not, stay away. It's a surprisingly cheap movie, and you can sometimes ask yourself if it's not just a joke someone shoots at you. The most positive comment I can make about this is that the managers seemed to realize that it was a nonsense with a very small budget, so there is at least something to have fun here. amateur as he becomes. Their idea of ​​giant killer mushrooms are just guys covered in beige-colored sheets with what looks like trash covers on their heads. This is obviously not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with this disclaimer, you find yourself shaking your head at the incredible cheesiness. Or laughing frequently, as I did.
