The original "Cube" is a fantastic B-movie rich in paranoia, with fleshy characterization and extravagant performances. It's scary, cryptic and cool. And it resists perfectly well, without any stupid continuation like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This third (!) film from the Cube series is partly retreaded (most of the traps are unfortunately recycled), partly aberrated. It's daring to explain what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first film - but, since that explanation is bland, I'd rather keep it secret. There are potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside the cube, but they never develop beyond the allusions to a kind of totalitarian politico-religious state. So, what a little social comment he feels flat and fuzzy. <br /> <br /> What works? Basically nothing. The acting is purely amateur, the pace is slow (how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen?), And gores effects, while revolting, fail to convince. In short, "Cube Zero" reminded me of a fan-fic "Cube", a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that absolutely does not need a sequel.
