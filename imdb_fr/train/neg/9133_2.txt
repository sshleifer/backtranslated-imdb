This is strictly a chronicle of the pilot episode as it appears on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Television left my life in 1981, so I've never followed the entire series - which means I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most critics. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning possible) <br /> <br /> The Moonlighting pilot is your basic thread "caveman fluffball", where a "charming" man with red hair manipulates a lost woman realizing what she really wants and needs. The premise on which the "spirit" of the script is based must already have been flying around 1950. It also contains some frankly bad writings, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furniture instead of shooting at the villain, for the sole purpose to prove oneself. woman in need of male assistance. <br /> <br /> I often get the impression that Susan Faludi reacts excessively by seeing the plot of the chauvinistic men during a simple entertainment, but in this particular case, I am quite at his side - Moonlighting is labeled BACKLASH. <br /> <br /> In a way, this DVD is a must for all serious fans of Bruce Willis: besides the pilot episode, it contains the test of the screen which allowed Willis to get the job. Both characteristics show how much Willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Note (and I'm a fan of Bruce Willis): 2 of 10
