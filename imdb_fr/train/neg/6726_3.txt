Everyone who saw Shine, Scott Hicks' film, tells the heartbreaking yet joyful life of pianist David Helfgotts; I am sure to realize that "the soloist" is very poor in comparison. It's as slow as a lullaby (I took five breaks to answer emails just to wake up). Representing the homeless region well above and extremely complacent, on a par with the terrible battle on the beach described in Joe Wrights' other disaster, Attonment. Fox's performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility on the part of offset. although struggling with a fast-paced movie, always manages to charm, is it me or is it becoming George Clooney in more ways than one?). It is, however, pointless to compare these two so-called well-known "STAR actors", because the shining light in acting must be Geoeffry Rush's "Shine", whose brilliant performance is definitely brighter in my sky. With "Attonment" and "The Soloist", the written word wins much more prizes for its empathy with the subject. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD to be in the basement of bargains soon.
