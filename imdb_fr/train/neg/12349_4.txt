A real disappointment of the great visual master, Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first woman to have followed the infernal training of the Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and the most difficult that exists, as the instructor in the film tells the main character O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no message or special point in this film or I could not achieve it correctly. It may be a kind of statement of women's rights and abilities, but all of that sinks into the tired scenes and the stupid fight at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand why Ridley uses so many zooms in the last battle in the desert ?! It looks so stupid and irritating and almost amateurish that I really want to know what the director has seen in this technique. When I watch his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely no problem on the battle scenes (which are many), they are very intense and directed with talent. The whole finale in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more than turning and killing stupid and brainless. <br /> <br /> This is Ridley Scott's worst film in my opinion and there are no significant touches for which this great director is known. I'm still happy to have seen that in Widescreen format because there are still some great scenes and examples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this movie. <br /> <br /> A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien, etc.) of this talented director. I am therefore obliged to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
