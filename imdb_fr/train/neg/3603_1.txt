Is this movie sucks! Horrific actor play, horrible storyline, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible !! Nothing redeems here even the most fervent horror fans! A mad killer stalks college students. People are dead in the corridors, but still, the class continues as usual ??? After about the 4th body, I think they could leave a few days off for the students! LOL. It's about as bad as it can happen to people. This film should be presented as a means of torture for criminals. You were warned!
