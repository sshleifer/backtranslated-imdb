If you thought the original of 83 was bad, try this masterpiece of modern times. How could this be worse if you asked? Well ... at least in the first case, you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra. In addition to updated graphics, modern themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a new sexy voice for Ripley, this is unfortunately the same tired story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line of the story was going. And for all those who have not seen the first ... well, consider yourself lucky to have looked at it only once. Maybe in 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
