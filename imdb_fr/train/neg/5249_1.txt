I'm 13 years old and I hated this movie because it's the worst movie on earth. I totally lost my time watching it and I was disappointed because on the cover and back of the film, it looks pretty good, but I was wrong. but when I saw Delta she was totally different and a bad actress and I really did not know how old the 2 girls were trying to be I was so confused. the movie was in some confusing parts and I did not like it at all but I watched the whole movie just to see if it would get better, but it did not do it, it was boring, dull and I said BORING.and I do not think a lot of people liked it as well as me. boring annoying
