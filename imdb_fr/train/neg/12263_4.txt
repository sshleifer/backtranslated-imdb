Seeing this movie, as I just did for the first time on Turner Classic (which classifies it as "Dangerous Female"), can only multiply your satisfaction for the Bogart-Astor version of 1941. Ricardo Cortez was to be paid by the smirk. I hope he remembered his dentist and his salesman Brylcreem in his will; they made him the actor he was. The women are all good, but no better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "originals" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who skillfully deliver a number of individual tics, but almost nothing of the changing moods of their successors in roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor have somehow transcended the evil character of their characters in the remake; here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie does not really stink; it rests like a big slice of ham. Its main value today is to remember that great movies like the "Falcon" of 41 do not just happen. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a score of 4, mainly for working with the camera and the players who support it.
