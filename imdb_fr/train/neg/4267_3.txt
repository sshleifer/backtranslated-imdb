I saw this film at the Rotterdam festival, as probably all other voters. The manager was there and seemed to have worked very hard and was very committed to the project, which I think explains the above average reception and rating. It sounds a lot like a feature film episode of "Round the Twist," the favorite movie of Australian children, but it takes too much of this redemptive feature. The film itself may be worth visiting if you are trying to make a world film tour in all UN Member States, because I can not think of another Fijian film, but in the together, it was a generic movie, badly played (even though an amateur cast) and prey to the subordinate mentality. The moral of the story seems to be that the native islanders are trying to hurt themselves, but as long as there is a decent white governor in which to intervene, all the problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
