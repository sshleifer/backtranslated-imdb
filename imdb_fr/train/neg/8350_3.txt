I just got back from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I must say that I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow (do not get me wrong, I like slow movies!), To the point of driving you crazy. All you hear is Julio Chavez who breathes strongly throughout the film. It's a poor film, but more importantly, it's an uninspired film, I did not feel anything for the story or for its characters. make a movie ... make it forgetful. I would advise you to let this one go, if you want to see good Argentinean films, look for Sorin's films.
