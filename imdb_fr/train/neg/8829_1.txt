It's an abominable story. It takes about an hour in the movie before we have a good idea of ​​what it is supposed to be about; characters often mumble inaudibly; actions often seem to have no relation to each other; no one seems to be worried about the murder of the girl; two spooky children are going to swim in waters that seem threatening, but nothing happens; The Irishman is hit in the face by one of his friends for no apparent reason ... continuing would be as boring as the film itself. The only half-entertaining element is landscape photography; but anyone can point a camera to the Australian outback and get memorable photos. All in all - sad, incoherent, pretentious - and downright annoying to waste so much time on the viewer.
