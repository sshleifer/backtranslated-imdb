... if I had looked at it in my teenage years. This film was slightly entertaining. What I liked about Soul Survivors was the gothic atmosphere that prevailed during the evenings and the constant rocking between "dream" and "reality". <br /> <br /> Had not there been films like "The 6th Sense" and "Do not Look Now" I would have been surprised by the end.
