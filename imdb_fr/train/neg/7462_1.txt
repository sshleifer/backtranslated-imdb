Management must be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talk about editing a skit for Fawlty Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too fragile and not funny. The second branch was too stiff to be funny. The third was just fragile enough to be funny. "Corky Romano" lacks this kind of attention to detail. Although the comic was not embarrassing, it was not repaired or left on the ground. The only value I can find in this film is the study of a very imperfect film that escaped into the distribution without being repaired. <br /> <br /> I have scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of critics praising this waste of absolute time reinforces my feeling that some people are being paid to promote titles. I do not see how anyone over the age of 9 could be more than 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money, give this score an average score. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. And, hey, I like the Three Stooges and I can even support Ed Wood!
