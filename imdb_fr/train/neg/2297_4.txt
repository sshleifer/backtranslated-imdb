I turn on the 700 Club from time to time and only approve some of the statements. I am one of many believers considered liberal by most Christians and conservatives by most non-Christians. I vote my mind, and it's usually not rep. or dem. - I do not think Club 700 tells people what to believe, but that it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative circles. I think a lot of people do not understand what is being said about the 700 club. It hurts me to hear my name calling either direction. I think 700 club members really love Jesus, but are so busy getting people to vote conservatively that they forgot to show their love to some people and to promote peace as Jesus did. Please do not judge Jesus on the basis of ignorant individuals who believe in Him, and let us not be so ignorant with our comments about them. Why are people so mean to each other?
