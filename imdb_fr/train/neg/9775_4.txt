The beautiful performances and the artistic direction do not make a good film. This film is so dark and depressing that I absolutely could not rejoice in the "happy" end of the union strike. Attempts of humor involving Lake's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous, and any movie involving a Baldwin brother has a strike against him already. On a positive note, Lang is still one of the big underrated players in the US, and it's almost his alone to keep it in the VCR. I give him a 4.
