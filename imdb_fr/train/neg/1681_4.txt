Freeway Killer, is a madman who shoots people on the highway while shouting a mystical song on a car phone. The police think he is a random killer, but Sunny, the blonde heroine, played by Darlanne Fluegel, detects a pattern. The same goes for the ex-cop, played by James Russo, who join forces and their bodies in search of the villain who eliminated their wife. Also played by Richard Belzer, this film has its highlights, especially if you like car chases, but it's really not a good movie for the most part. Check if you're really bored and have already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown. otherwise stay away from the highway.
