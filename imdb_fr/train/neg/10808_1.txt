I was given the version of Kazaam's book for my 8th birthday, and people always say that the versions of the book are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the film, the film is soon over. <br /> <br /> The action in this film is terrible, what I expected from a movie with Shaq playing a magical rap genius out of an old ghetto blaster (there was probably a good reason for which he was stuck there). The kid in the movie that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor. He is being bullied by neighborhood kids, which I do not blame them for he is a shit bag. <br /> <br /> The story is simply stupid and extremely clich√©. About a boy whose father is still working and who has never found a new friend who improves his life and eventually helps him reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even at age 8, I thought it was a stupid idea. . It is a surprise that all the people who worked on this film had careers after the failure because they are annoying and they should never have been done. I could talk even more about how this film fears, but you should already know it by reading the plot.
