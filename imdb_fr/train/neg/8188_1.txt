The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous film is its conception: if one becomes a saint, he and his family and his other significant being live forever. Let's forget that to become a saint, the saint must be dead and the saints have no other significant people. That, for a millennium, Nick is the Jolly Elf of Fred's Scrooge, it is never alluded to that! Open Nick by learning how to make toys, then Fred learning to handle numbers; Nick gives a dolly to a sick child, Fred picks him up, and the family farm! After a few more episodes of this type, metamorphoses into the current Fred exploding his spleen at Siblings Anonymous while his fellow losers nod their heads empathically. There, I just wrote a scenario more coherent than this idiocy! <br /> <br /> This Santa, who is "a, ho, ho, ho, ho" of a massive coronary, is a neurotic cat struggling with the Queen of Harpies, an operation straight out of the Mega-Mall Hell, and who answers a tip (eh?) That has just given her pink egg to the Easter bunny. Oh, and his right arm is a bright blond, wearing a tight-fitting mini-dress and boots boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really put me to the test is that Slam is named # 1 on the list of villains. Should not a Naughty List be reserved for future Hitlers and Stalins? Children who are the real incarnations of evil? No, at Old Sausage-Fingers, a good boy who breaks loose because he is junk and unloved is the seed of demon! <br /> <br /> The nimrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding! Bah!
