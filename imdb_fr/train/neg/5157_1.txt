I really despised this film when I saw it at the age of 6 or 7, because I was a big fan of Robin Williams and he could not do anything wrong. Waiting. This complete junk ruined Robin for me for a long time. I only recently recovered with his funny but serious role in Father's Day, but he then created another mistake, Bicenntinial Man. I think it was called, but the goal is. Robin should have much better jobs now and now he's back to playing the slime that started with this "classic".
