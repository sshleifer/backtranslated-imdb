How come I have never seen or even heard of this unwanted movie before? It suits me like a glove with a bloody teenager, a laughable plot and an irresistible 80s cheese atmosphere. For some reason, no one really cares, the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are slaughtered by an unknown psychopath. Julie Parker, a recently recruited teacher, gets involved when everyone she comes into contact with is dead or behaving strangely. This movie is hilarious bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence and each character is also meaningless to others. For example, a girl was killed and her body thrown into a container. Then, and for no reason, the story suddenly advances three weeks and yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed. Not even by his boyfriend! The acting is pitiful and there is not even a bit of nudity to enjoy. The revelation of the killer is quite funny because the manufacturers seemed really convinced that it was an original twist ... This is not the case, guys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst turkeys in horror.
