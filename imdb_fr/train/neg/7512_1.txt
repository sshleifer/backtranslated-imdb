I had to go out of the theater. After an hour, all I saw were people who cheated on their wives, bickering like dogs in a rut and using the word-word as a diabetic using Equal. <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> It was particularly frustrating because the film could have done a lot. Any of the characters could have been interesting enough if they had been given more to do than fornicate, talk about it and swear to each other. <br /> <br /> The few times it seemed like he was about to be a kind of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. The development of the parcel during the first hour can be summarized as follows: 1) several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees the scene of the murder 3) Vinnie looks sullenly across the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on his wife and 5) Joey (the nicest character in the show) gets fired from his parents' house. More than that, I did not wait to see. <br /> <br /> The photography and the interaction between the characters were superb, but they had nothing to do. The tide of sex and vulgarity was not worth the wait for another hour for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. One or the other is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
