The movie was not a waste of time, except for some boring scenes between the two. But the female cast gave a pretty good show that men laughable. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really got into the movie. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes in bed involving Krista should have been shortened but she made them so much sexier and sexy that no one could do it. Krista She is also one of the best in such roles. She also played the role of villain in the last 5 minutes, which is the interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good as not his best as a star of the action.He could have chosen a better script than this one.He really thinks he's done for money.
