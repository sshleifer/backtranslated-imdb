Interesting? Barely. The "scientific evidence" provided by the film (which is essentially that the Jews are cancer) is so stupid and lame that it's almost laughable (if we did not know what happened at that time). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah. I can not imagine that the Germans (even at this horrible time) would like or believe this film. Compare it to the Triumf of the Willens of Riefenstahl. Now it was the movie that impressed me. This is just a stupid stupidity. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is a scene from M (one of my favorites of all time) where (the Jew, as the announcer reminds us so eloquently) Lorre plays a child -molester and murderer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a depraved mind can do it. Uh-huh. I did not know that M was Hitler's favorite movie, was not it? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even for his kind of Nazi propaganda. 2/10.
