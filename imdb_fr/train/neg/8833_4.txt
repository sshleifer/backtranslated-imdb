Without fault of the actors (they all realized superb performances), the story was not very well executed. The film begins with a big zinger: a crazy old man forces the car of an aboriginal girl. But then, we have to support 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new character group ... and we do not know why until the 40 minutes are up. It turns out that they are the ones who finally discover the girl's body ... and that the story progresses from there. <br /> <br /> The story begins again at that time, but it really does not lead to anything. After 2 hours, I wondered: does it make sense, or was it just to see the characters struggling with accusations of racism and stupidity about how they handled the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and seemed unfinished. Although the film is well played, the film does not contain enough spine to justify its recommendation.
