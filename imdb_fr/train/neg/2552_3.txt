This is listed as a documentary, it's not, it's filmed as a documentary, but I guess it's just because then they get away with a shaky camera and a shady shoot. It's just been released in the UK on DVD as "American Pie comedy", that's not it either. <br /> <br /> This is basically a group of teens on spring break while they are traveling to Mexico for cheap drinks and with the quest being to get there a virgin friend finally posed. Throw is a dwarf couple, also in the same kind of quest and you have a non-hilarious story of drunken teenagers trying to get girls. <br /> <br /> Given the rating of 18, this has very little nudity, and practically no sex scene, I guess the odds are for swear words that abound. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass's rude behavior without humor, then this may be your thing, if you have brain cells left then I would probably avoid this!
