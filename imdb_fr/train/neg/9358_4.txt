From the moment the film begins, there is already a divergence. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, and it is also an international film, one could expect the appropriate accents to be represented. This is not done because the majority of American sound actors. Also, I find that acting is at best repeated, the story a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very precise in costumes and scenery. If you want to see a movie to get an idea of ​​what it was in the past (though lack of accents), then this movie is worth renting. If you are looking for a film as epic as Kingdom of Heaven, look elsewhere.
