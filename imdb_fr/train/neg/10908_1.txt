Nothing in this movie is funny. I thought that the principle of giving a human the libido of an excited ram is interesting and should give rise to some laughter. FALSE! There is simply nothing funny in the movie. For example, the main character who walks past a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's garden is not funny, it borders on obscenity. They play with bestiality in this movie on one level and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character who does this with everything, everywhere, every time is not funny either. It becomes a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I suppose, acceptable in the role. I mean, he's not a bad actor, but with rotten material, it's hard to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the HUMAN-Romantic track (does she count the number of animals for which the main character has an interest as romantic tracks too?), Seems just as embarrassed by everything that it should be. She seems to act in a kind of emptiness, detached from all the other actors of the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this film only if you want to get bored with tasteless, dull and repetitive material.
