As a Danish, I am proud of the handful of good Danish films that have been produced in recent years. It is unfortunate, however, that this improvement in quality has led the majority of Danish film critics to lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it became so serious that I no longer trust Danish film critics and, as a result, stopped watching them in movie theaters. let me stress that "Villa Paranoia" would be a terrible movie in all circumstances. The fact that it was put forward by critics only fueled my disappointment bonfire with the Danish film. In addition, waiting until it is released on DVD helps very little to fight against the unwavering feeling of wasting time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is an accomplished director, gifted for social realism in Copenhagen. I particularly enjoyed "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, although he generally plays the same role in all his films, namely that of a slob of the helpless working class, partly because he is a slob but mostly to cause of society, and doing something good for his community. <br /> <br /> This is the number one problem in "Villa Paranoia"; Clausen presents himself as a chicken farmer, which is a break with the norm and never manages to make it credible. <br /> <br /> It's a lot worse, though, that the film has to go around and break all the rules of how to tell a story so the public understands what's going on. For example, the film begins with a very sad attempt to visualize the impending death experience of the main character using low-budget effects and bad camera work. After that, the character tells his best friend that she suddenly felt the need to jump off a bridge. It's symptomatic of the whole movie. there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communication, whatever the motivation: Say instead of show. Thus, at one point, a character speaks aloud to a supposedly catatonic person about how he feels, because the script did not allow him to play his feelings. and later, the voice-over is introduced abruptly, perhaps afterwards, to convey feelings that otherwise would remain unknown to the public because of the director's unfitness. Fortunately, at this point, you have about an hour left to worry about one of the characters, let alone the so-called story. <br /> <br /> The acting game, which has often been a problem in Clausen's films, may be SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other claim to be a star was Big Brother, is not worse than many of the actors mentioned in the distribution. <br /> <br /> Rating 2 out of 10.
