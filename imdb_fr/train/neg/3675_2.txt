Really, everyone in this movie seems to want to be somewhere else! No wonder, casting is not done with the left hand, but rather not at all. I did not see anything worse than Natascha McElhone pretending to be some sort of officer carrying a gun. You do not use a spoiled spoiled city look in such a role. The only thing I can imagine is to call prostitute Doris Day. The rest of the cast is also awful, perhaps with Hurt as the only exception. Sometimes you can see him try, but suffer. Oh, did I mention it's a crazy story? Endanger the lives of many people because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography could be worse.
