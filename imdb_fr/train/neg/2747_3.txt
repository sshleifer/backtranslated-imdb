I knew that would be the case, but I gave him a rent for some laughs and maybe a stupid fun. Anyone who has read some of my reviews can see that I am quite easy to please. I really did not think I would end up feeling that negatively. <br /> <br /> The plot speaks of an ancient dragon army led by a huge snake that will destroy the world unless chosen heroes inherit the responsibility can ?? to become one with ?? a good dragon ?? or something?? I do not know. It was so stupid that I did not bother to make a lot of effort to keep it. <br /> <br /> This is a really stupid story, full of ridiculous moments and crazy concepts. Many events felt totally random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I guess there was studio interference or something like that, because the biggest problem I have with the movie is that the story seems to want to be that way . grandiose and epic, yet everything happens so fast and passes so quickly. I feel like I just got a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball. The film is like a punch in the face. It does not take a lot of time to create characters or plays. Imagine the trilogy "The Lord of the Rings" in 90 minutes ?? You could have most epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no accumulation and you would not care about the outcome of those battles. This was the case with Dragon Wars ?? 90 minutes of me not screaming and waiting for everything to be over. <br /> <br /> A fantastic CGI with an acceptable staging, but a horrible game, a fast pace and a silly story made the task very difficult, whatever the reason. . I would have probably loved it when I was 6 years old.
