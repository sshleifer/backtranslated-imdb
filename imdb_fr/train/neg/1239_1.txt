Being a big fan of the "other" PLANET OF THE APES movies, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all that is Tim Burton. Once again, he does not fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even the makeup of the monkeys seems second-rate, which is unforgivable given the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough proof). I was bothered by real talent such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt their salary motivated them because it could not be a scenario based on clich√©s. I rented this DVD for a special night at $ 1 and I still feel ripped off.
