RKS films have always been commercial films adapted to the 90s, from GHAYAL, DAMINI <br /> <br /> His latest films, KHAKEE, were watchable. FAMILY was crap <br /> <br /> This movie is a decent film but better <br /> <br /> The problem is that there are a lot of old clich√©s and many scenes that come out too much long and too long <br /> <br /> The character of Ajay Devgan is very well shown, but his character becomes heroic, which could be subtle <br /> <br /> The long backtrack could be avoided because the posters are just lying down <br /> <br /> Even street games in the second half seem too simplistic and hardly a solution. the message went well <br /> <br /> The direction of RKS is correct, but could be better The music is fine <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan looks good and plays very well To play his role most of the time, he looks uncomfortable in the light scenes. He excels in drama. Vidya excels in the scenes in front of the media. Pankaj has a poorly defined and filmed role. Does it excels in its share Darshan Jariwala hams like the old villain the rest are ok
