It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen without a doubt. The only interesting thing in this movie is the presence of some great genre directors and King himself. The film has a good base, but falls apart about 15 minutes after the beginning of the story. I loved Madchen Amick in this movie and I think she could have a very good film career.
