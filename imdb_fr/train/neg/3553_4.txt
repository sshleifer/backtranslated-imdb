"The Incubus" is a mix of good (an interesting murder mystery), bad (an offline script, a sloppy resolution, badly done attack scenes) and the weird (strong incestuous shades, a strangely sleepy performance) and stiff of John Cassavetes - was this character really supposed to be as "wacko"?). Not as offensive as it is said, but not particularly successful either. (* 1/2)
