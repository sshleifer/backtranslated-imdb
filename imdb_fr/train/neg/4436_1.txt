I gave this movie a rating of 1 (Awful). The only reason he should even get a 1 instead of a big-0 is Ben Kingsley, who always shines, no matter what terrible material is thrown at him. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so extravagant Here, as a spectator, you simply can not forget the fact that she is even in such a movie. Stupid stupid story and horrible production. Do not waste your rental video $.
