These are not the most successful slasher movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty fun. The plot is lame but the victims are not too bad. To be honest, if you do not follow the bands in this movie, you will not find this movie as funny as those who do it. I knew someone who had seen this movie and was really disappointed with the poor quality of the film, but you must understand that it was shot during free time, on tour, between playing with children and drinking behind the scenes with friends. ..it is not meant to be taken seriously. It's ubber cheese at its best punk and with over 100 dead, most of which are ultra-bloody, it's a fun movie to have friends watching, drinking and being happy!
