I saw this movie a few years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I took a look. What really keeps me in mind is that it makes no sense and that is why it bothers. Richard is tied up in a fence and Jarvis begins to kiss Richard's daughter while she is unconscious. Then, Jarvis's troublemaker Troubador plays a stupid song on the guitar. The next morning, we see Richard's daughter talking to Jarvis and Trouby, then she comes back to Richard and looks at him while he's still tied up. Then they play happy music and the movie is over. I mean what happened? Did they brake? And what was she saying to these two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It's too confusing and too poor. I can not stand movies that are bothering and meaningless. This is the worst movie I have ever seen since Lord of the Flies version 90.
