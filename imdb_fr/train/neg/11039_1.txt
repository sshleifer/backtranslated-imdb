All the fun things that happen in this sitcom are based on the fact that the main character Jim is a bad father, a bad husband or usually just a lot of selfishness. How can this be funny? Of course, a character in a sitcom must have flaws, but Jim's is extremely unfriendly. <br /> <br /> And why? I guess it's because he "should be better now". Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of everything and he has the opportunity to do it. But he chooses not to do it. It's a conscious choice, when he chooses not to play with his children, not to shop because he does not want to buy "products for ladies" and it's a choice he makes when he drops his relatives. <br /> <br /> The other characters seem to be only part of the series, which allows Jim to have someone to please. If Cheryl's character was a real person, she would have left him years ago and would not stay with the bad guy for 8 years. But alas, she is only the catalyst for the extreme selfishness of Jim's middle class.
