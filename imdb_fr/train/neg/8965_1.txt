Rather, it is a low-budget film, designed for television, intended to capitalize on the success of the original film. I'm a fan of b-movies, and this one might have been good if he had not given them the name "Cube" because, as is, the director and the plot of the original were better , and this film almost ruined my taste for the whole series. The characters are annoying and clich√©s, there are continuity problems and several production errors. History has little chance of developing because of superfluous dialogue and it suffers from it. They have more or less used the same horror gadgets throughout the movie, and since the first one was so good, it's just a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If it was a single b-self movie, I would probably give about a four. The "1" rating I gave her was pretty much an affirmation of how she had completely concealed her effects and intelligence from the first one.
