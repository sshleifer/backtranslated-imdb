I'm not saying that Night of the Twisters was horrible, but it was far from great. Mediocre at best absolute. It seems that each time a type of film is released, a second one must be around the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Twister Night is really just Twister, if not worse and with ordinary special effects. <br /> <br /> I do not have anything against the actors who played there, even if they were not great, it was the film itself, the staging, the special effects, the scenario in full was too strange to be interpreted. A series of tornadoes hit a city and the film is about people trying to find their family and friends and deal with the damage. <br /> <br /> I really do not know why it seems that copies of disaster films are duplicated. published almost in sync with each other, but this one would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
