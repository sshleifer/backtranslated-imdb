It was really weird and they did not sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this movie. At the beginning of the film, there was also a very annoying guy who was part of the gang of thieves. He had that American voice that moaned like a girl shouting lines like "Get the F # $ k out of here" and what are we gonna do. "He looked like a girl. as a positive point, it was fun to watch and it made me laugh for a few seconds too Whoo Hoo! Dumb Film Poor Madsen, he'll bounce back ...
