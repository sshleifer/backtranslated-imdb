This film should not be watched as it was supposed to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this film a remake of the classic Bollywood film "Sholay", but after having problems with the original producers, he decided to continue the project and ... script, songs, music , comedy, action, etc.) and shoot the film just because he has already hired the team. Loss of money, loss of time. After making films like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he launched a Coppola (Godfather); What did you think RGV? Be that as it may, the story is hard to follow, but it looks almost like old Sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, the new neighborhood boy playing Ajay (Jay, sholay). The two "mean but funny" friends help a cop catch a villain first. Later in the film, retired police officers hired them to protect their personal safety and protect them from the hands of the highly sought after Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. In case you do not watch Bollywood movies, the good guys will win at the end. There I have saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
