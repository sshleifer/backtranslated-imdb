The annoying mouse and lullaby really touched me and really have nothing to do with history ... It's something I would have done in first year of film school. Very sad. In addition, the story seemed to drag on for no apparent reason ... there were too many things thrown in that had nothing to do with the story, which gives me the impression that the creative team did not know really what it was doing, or just that it should have been shorter ... which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I just watched all the episodes of the past week ... I must say that it was by far the worst and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.
