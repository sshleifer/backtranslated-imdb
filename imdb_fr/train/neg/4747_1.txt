I thought this movie was terrible. I am Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many facts were incorrect. The only thing wrong with the film's history in Chinese history is that Wendy's mother explained to her husband the statues guarding ShiHuangDi. I also thought that the fight scenes were very lame and false. Many actors and actresses were not very good. Some of the supposedly "funny" jokes were really stupid. I think this film should receive the worst rating possible. Disney really needs more information on Chinese history if it wants to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was pretty accurate. Watch this movie if you want to waste time.
