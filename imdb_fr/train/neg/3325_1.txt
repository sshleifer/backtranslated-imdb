I hated. If you believe that everyone in the South is dumb, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a madman or a pedophile, then this movie may be for you. Everyone is poor and apparently ignorant. In one scene, two older men are chatting in a general store and one of them mentions that he assaulted a group of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions and the other man clearly took him for a normal part of life. Very pleasant. A teenager walks the alleys in search of her sister and no one offers help - despite obvious lameness and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). The character of Strathairn is not only completely disgusting and slimy, but he turns out to be a religious believer who (typical of Hollywood) reflects the vile nature of Christians. One scene in the movie is a strong reminder of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) - biblical verses were revealed by the villain. I come from the Great Northwest, but I found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, etc.
