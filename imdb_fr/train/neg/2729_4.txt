The real philanthropic gesture of actress Ruth Roman to entertain troops arriving from the Korean War at the air base near San Francisco and to leave for the Korean War kicked off this tribute to patriotism and singing. Many celebrities make appearances as a story of love and hate develops between an aspiring starlet and a painfully green and skinny Army Corporal (Ron Hagerthy, who seems to have been delivering newspapers from his bike). It looks like the corporal fooled the actress into believing he went into battle while part of an aircraft carrier crew flying to and from Honolulu (you'd think she'd be happy that it remains safe from danger, but it acts rather like most children's women in 1950s movies). Doris Day is around for about thirty minutes, and her numbers of fun and daring songs are most enjoyable. Roman is also present, glamorous, while James Cagney makes fun of his character on the screen and Gordon MacRae sings in his beautiful baritone. Jane Wyman also sings at a bedside recovery after Doris Day. One wondered then: "Are they short of sets?" For the less demanding viewers, an interesting look back to another place and another era. Still, low-rent production and the right technical aspects make Starlift a true second-transmitter. * 1/2 of ****
