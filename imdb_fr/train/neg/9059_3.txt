I'm just going to be vague about my possible mess reviews. There are enough elements of the plot in this film for it to be ruined to say the least. <br /> <br /> This film draws some ideas from a Southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I guess TKOM may have had their ideas from any source ... anyway, after looking at this, you'll say, "Oh yes, it's a scam." <br /> <br /> I think the real A fun thing about these McMovies is that once you've identified a plot element, it's about whether they will stay true to the original or if they will try to turn it. Not a lot of twists in this one.
