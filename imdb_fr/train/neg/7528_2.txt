It's even worse than the original game of death. A confused and incoherent scenario leads to the fall of "Billy Lo" from a helicopter on the ground, killing him, while we left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So, not only are we starting to follow a Bruce Lee clone, but the film kills this one and forces us to follow another thirty minutes after the beginning of the story. The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo is fighting a lion, who is obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is generally great, but his on-screen time is greatly reduced. Mostly looked at this and the original game of death because they are part of Bruce Lee's cabinet. It is not surprising that they are included in Lee's finished works. Nobody would buy them otherwise.
