"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most discussed films since "The Exorcist", I think. Considering that the Executive Vice President is supposed to be true, it has really been easy to become a dreaded fact. Few films come to embody fear in people's minds. As I said, this movie could have, but did not. The film has deteriorated to become a scary movie of lower class PG-13. Nothing like "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense", far from it. Someone really has to take care of the horror film industry and make a movie that makes us think, but that makes us jump, scream, all that a horror movie should do. Honestly, I'm sick of the PG-13 Horror genre, because it's becoming a genre of its own. We need to get back to the old days, the bloody, bloody days, the days Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Myers. Few movies can have a thought on this mindset so being not scary. So why try to remove it? Some good jumps in this movie are nothing more than a stupid ending in the film's history, without any resolution ... do not waste your money in this movie.
