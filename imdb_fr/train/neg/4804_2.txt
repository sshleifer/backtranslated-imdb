I do not watch much television and I came across this show. Reality show? I hope it's not real. If I were a man and I had such a scum and I was married to someone so arrogant, that would be a reason for divorce. I think it gives a bad example of how a person should treat someone they love. It's something that is wrong in our world now. So many people in bad relationships are selfish and do not know what it really means to love another. It is a sacrifice of oneself and not something that should be put aside. This does not give you a very good feeling of looking at what should be in the private board. If his personality in the series is real, then he deserves something much better, that would show him true love and take him seriously, and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or is offset by the critics ???? I would really like to know. Sincerely, GB
