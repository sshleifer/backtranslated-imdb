I saw "Paris I love you" because a friend really wanted to see him, so I accompanied him. On entering, the film left me indifferent, but leaving the theater, I really regret having lost 2 hours of my life in this lukewarm production. The "stories" are almost completely forgettable, with the exception that most of them were awful. What does Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors has undoubtedly given this French film a remarkably non-French impression. The clichés on Paris were infinite. Yes, most of them played with clichés on Paris but spending so much time making fun of the French clichés, they have directly and unfortunately encouraged once again. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We understood it. <br /> <br /> The worst segments were: the one led by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; the mime (the worst?); hair products one; the one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the heart of Paris?); the vampire (When I think of Paris, I think of Elijah Wood). The one with Natalie Portman, which really looked like an advertisement from Mentos and was stupid (the blind young man had to know that Portman was just playing a role when she called him). And so on. I felt endless. <br /> <br /> I did not like that of Coen Bros. He really plays with these pictures of Paris but I did not find it funny. Just boring. That of Gus Van Sant was interesting, but it was so light (and the striking line was obvious) that it was barely recorded. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were the one of the immigrant nurse who leaves her baby in kindergarten only to keep a baby for a rich woman. Beautiful irony there. And the segment on the African who is stabbed. This is the best segment of the whole movie but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have taken place in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment, the one with the chubby mature woman, was rather interesting, but the underlying tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate his limited knowledge of French, but the debate turned out to be condescending. <br /> <br /> The whole project seemed constrained and uninspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. In total, with only 10 to 15 minutes of interesting films, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a dreadful cinematic experience.
