I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the US) and it felt like it was really an awful movie. But they had to cut some of the original film, otherwise I missed a lot of things. The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I read several other comments on IMDb.com mentioning vulgarity and something about a stamp. I have not seen anything like it, just a bad boring movie with unimaginable characters and a banal and sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth in the air or botox√©e to the gills, and his expression does not touch the face. And his name makes me think of an oversized drink at Taco Bell: "I'll take the Cola Grande!" It was actually quite fun, I played like in my Mystery Science Theater 3000, noting things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It's really like silly putty!
