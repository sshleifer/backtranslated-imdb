The atmosphere of this film is quite good and captures the feeling of the 80s with good performance. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script is run from the mill except for some comic moments and comes up as weird where I expect that he is supposed to be pissed off. The characters are totally dramatized, unbelievable and full of clich√©s on the right that the screenwriter has probably seen watching a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. This ticks all the good boxes "arty" but nothing really happens and in the end, you wonder what it really was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
