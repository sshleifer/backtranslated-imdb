It's a genre genre, which means you like 1950s musicals or not. If you do, you will love it. Personally, I prefer musicals from the '30s and' 40s with the talents of Astaire and Rogers dancers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, etc., but the songs of the 50's, the slowest dance numbers and soapy melodramas of the decade stifle me. <br /> <br /> This film is a concrete example. The first song was correct but the following three did not bring me anything. At that time, the story did not have much interest. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another disadvantage. I do not think I've seen a movie in which she plays that I like, including this one, where the English teacher with two shoes she portrays spends half of the film threatening to leave Siam. (I had it!). <br /> <br /> However, if I part with the tastes and depreciations, it is clear that this production of Rogers and Hammerstein has a lot of appeal for many people, especially those who liked "The Sound Of Music "a decade later. There are similarities in R & H musicals. So, if you liked Julie Andrews' movie, you should love it too. <br /> <br /> It's a sumptuous production with, yes, a capital letter "L." It's the kind of big-production musicals you've rarely seen after this generation. You also get the dubbed singers, unlike today, where the actress is not able to really sing. Marnie Nixon comes to Kerr's rescue, as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady". "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is" King Mongkut "and is the traditionalist stereotypist, the genre of filmmakers still depicted negatively.He is not" progressive ", as the left wing says, but the teacher of education (Kerr, like "Anna Leonowens") will put it back in order, today's lay progressives always place teachers higher than those who are trying to cure cancer, but Yul is good at it role and even employs a bit of comedy with his character more-bark-than-bite.Rightly, he is the big star of this movie.Brynner had magnetism.Also in "The Magnificent Seven", Yul was the only coward -boy who hypnotized the audience. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a good movie for the day and millions of people have appreciated it, so I'll stop there.
