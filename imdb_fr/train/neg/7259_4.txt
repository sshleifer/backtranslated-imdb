It's certainly one of the weirdest movies of the 70s, and it's particularly notable for launching a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also remarkable for the small touches of madness throughout the film, especially when the first half dark and sullen is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who paddles in a boat for a while, then ... leaves, never to be seen again). Although it's painfully dated now, I'm still a fun horror movie to show to kids, and anyone who loves the Bigfoot traditions or the 70s hillbilly culture will inevitably take it for a kick. My favorite part: a guy is so scared that he jumps his head first (!?) And the narrator explains that he has become unaware of the shock. Uh, I would say that breaking a door with his head is more likely the reason he became unconscious, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like the bad Americana.
