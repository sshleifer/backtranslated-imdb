The sequel to "Cleopatra Jones", a far better than 1973, saw the black statuary actress Tamara Dobson resume her iconic role as a classy and super-sturdy narcotics agent, here breaking a ring of heroin in Hong Kong. The cross-pollination of action movies and kung-fu on blaxploitation is fun at first, but eventually becomes a flag. The final of the shootout is just behind the assembly line, and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she is still sexy and she gives a unique twist to her comic dialogue, but this environment may have been too much 'a thing for her - she's jaded). Stella Stevens plays the villain this time; she is good, but can not compete with Shelley Winters in the predecessor. ** from ****
