Damn, only in the 70's ... Antonio Margheriti presents us this original hybrid of spaghetti western and kung-fu film that revolves around a treasure hunt. The spices of this cradle co-production between Shaw Brothers and a punctual Italian company include humorous tales, offbeat events and tame T & A. The obnoxious wig by Lee Van Cleef, the leather-clad bandit dressed in a bible that kills the skin of the fighter, Yancey Hobbitt (kindly hammered by Julian Ugarte, the man who should have made more obscure European genre productions), wants serene dialogue, hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various small events (especially all leaps made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> While this little piece of action is a welcome addition to Turkish territory, it's good to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not expect too much, and you will get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> That's my truth. What's yours?
