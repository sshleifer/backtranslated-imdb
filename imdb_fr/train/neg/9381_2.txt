Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society, in a life devoid of meaning, meaning and meaning. <br /> <br /> I watched this because of all the rave reviews, but I'm afraid I missed something. Mona's character has little or no personality as he crosses rudely with people, gaining height and bringing nothing to anyone's life. It is neither interesting nor exciting. She's just useless. <br /> <br /> I have seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they do. They are just idlers. I would not want Mona to be around me because she tends to steal anything that is not nailed and to leave her friends in embarrassment. Of course, she is enigmatic - because nothing concerns her. I saw a lot of junkies, winos and enigmatic buttocks; I would not want to see a movie about them either. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is something that totally missed me. Otherwise, I suppose that all critics are written by people who think that everything that is done by a French filmmaker is great art.
