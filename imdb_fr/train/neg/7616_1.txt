The good news is that a film was shot, based on a supposed Aztec myth and featuring an unusually Aztec American cast (if that's the case). The bad news is that he was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood was out of retirement and had coached George Romaro in his classic "Night of the Living Dead", here's what we could have imagined with. 'The Legend of Diablo' is clearly a food for future resurrections of 'Mystery Science Theater 3000!' <br /> <br /> I do not think we can even call it a movie "B". The production values ​​are so abominable that I always had the feeling of watching a long sketch of a variety show or an 8mm film shot in the yard by a group of schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The basic plot seemed interesting enough to convince me to praise it. A California rural sheriff finds a box containing an Aztec demon and accidentally drops it on the unsuspecting community. His daughters, a hot and a simple, team up with an FBI man and a priest, to try to reluctant the demon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene seen in previous undead movies is poorly reconstructed. These zombies walk more like an army of noised teachers than undead! The supposed infrared scenes from the point of view of the demon are nothing special ?? and he / she / it seems to be moving back a lot (instead of turning forward). And the scene where the priest drives the devil out of the cave in a hurry is ridiculous! It really seems, really, to be done for the comic effect - although I know it was not! I was still expecting Benny Hill's theme music to start playing and the whole zombie band to chase the priest in pursuit of the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course, the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams calls the FBI the agent becomes downright comical. Again, most of this cheese ball was too! Robert Napton, director and scriptwriter of the script, should earn something for this effort! (How about a black-ball lifestyle, like the "Hollywood 10?") This one, I see now, is rated at 1.5 out of 10. I'm afraid it's a bit generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good in this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks very hot as the younger daughter of the deceased sheriff. That's probably why his older sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who pitched for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should have stayed in baseball. In fact, they could not have done worse if they had chosen a baseball theme and called it "Demons in the Outfield". <br /> <br /> If I discover that this is a college film course project, I will apologize. This could be enough for a B or even a B + as long as the gang brings the college camcorder back to campus in one piece! "The Blair Witch Project" proved that a fun and cool movie could be made with a fortune. "The legend of Diablo", however, did not seem to have a shallow OR shoes to work! It was low budget, not very talented, not everything. The very last scene - and I'm talking about the last 10 seconds of the movie - is the ONLY slightly creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent this movie. I could have spent it better on a hamburger!
