I gave more than 1 because I thought there were moral lessons in this story and it caused a reflection and a comment from my wife and me. been beaten on the head with God this, God that and Christ is our savior substance. The movie and the script do not need it. If, like me, you are a Catholic or a Christian in recovery, avoid this one, it will make you nauseous. The film showed the dividing line between being a good citizen and how a person could become a potential stalker focused on what could have been.
