*** THIS CONTAINS SEVERAL, SEVERAL SPOILERS, NOT THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT, FOR ALL IS OWNED PATENTALLY *** <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where do I start? Well, here. This is the first time I come home from a movie and thought, "I need to access IMDb and write a review of this NOW, it's my civic duty." Such is the wickedness of this film. <br /> <br /> * start the digression * But let me tell you one thing before starting. I'm not a major-film-black-weenie from Harvard (actually, I went to college at the other end of the Mass. Ave in Cambridge, one where smart people without rich dads and trust funds go, which should put me squarely in the census group of comic-movies-who-would-obsessed-love-love-comic-love, and yet I hated this movie ...). My preference is for high-end cinematographic works that include Die Hards, Bond, The Clerks and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never sunk, not so much for the lost lives, but so that we were not subjected to this clutter of film. And the only reason I will watch a very arrogant French art film is if there is a young and often undressed Emmanuelle Beart. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of its precious 10 precious here on IMDb, for God's sake. I'm not criticizing this film because I'm looking for a standard of cinematic excellence - that's because Elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat. * fine digression * <br /> <br /> OK, there is so much nonsense here that I have to try to categorize them. Here is: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons for a man to see this movie is to see a lot of JGar (I do not see why my wife wanted it at all). I think between this and "Finding Nemo", the latter was the sexiest film. You know the red outfit she announced in all the ads you see? You see it in TWICE - once at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer. In the rest, it looks roughly what Morrissey would look like if he were a woman - lots of black and mocking clothes. Which brings me to the incredible range of expressions that JGar shows in his acting - ranging from "sulking" to "sulking and crying". Oh my God, you'd think she was forced to go out with Ben Affleck or something horrible like that. Uh, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE BAD GUYS / GAL: They show about the same field of expression and the same acting ability as you would expect from a pomelo slightly too ripe. At least next to the performance of JGar, it does not stand out too much. The role of a man is to be there and to be huge, another is to be there and to let stories go by, and the role of the woman is to be there and to breathe and / or to kiss people. They manage to shoot these incredible feats. The main villain has the most difficult role of all - he must SIMULTANEOUSLY a) look angry and b) look Asian. He is doing a good job in this regard. I think there was a fifth villain / gal, but my brain is starting to block some parts of this film in self-defense. <br /> <br /> TENTAMES OF GROUNDS! This film has as many surprises as a speech at the National Democratic Convention. Let's just say this - my wife, who has been in the US for only six months and speaks only a small number of English - whispered to me when the girl first appeared in JG's notebook, and I swear to God that I'm not inventing that: "She goes to her house to kill a girl, and her father too." And that's BEFORE THE FATHER EVEN APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. Now, my wife is not stupid, but Mensa is not courting her for her presents either, and she has no visibility on Daredevil or the comic genre. And she understood it in 0 00015 seconds, without any insistence or prior information. This is the blatant evidence of this film. <br /> <br /> A STUPIDITY RARELY BEFORE SEEN! OK, so there's this big guy in the movie. He can take a burst of shotgun and sweep the shot as if he were fluffy, and he can take a violent Electra stab at the chest and simply bend the metal (or melt it - or something - with more defenses in action, thank God). But JG jumps on his head and explodes? A little bit of Achilles? OKAY! Such is the senseless stupidity of this film. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm starting to experience a cerebral hemorrhage, so I have to stop. But you have been warned. If you have to intentionally cut your own tires to prevent you from going to see this film, DO IT. And if Armageddon is to come, please, leave it before this is published on DVD.
