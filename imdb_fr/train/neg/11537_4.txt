I watched the progress of these films for quite some time, so maybe a little bit too much. I consider that Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do. I'm interested to see what Dan Reed could offer, but unfortunately it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand the genre in which it falls and as such fails to impress the elements of drama, horror and thriller because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well, it's a bit of a hold on all the trades and the masters of none. <br /> <br /> The principle (as with most revenge movies) is simple, we meet and go out, something bad happens and they take their revenge, it's a simple formula that many directors have managed with expertise over the years. Unfortunately, in this case, it's as if Dan Reed thought: "It would be great to do one of those revenge movies that goes a step further by showing a more human side to all the characters and deepening their mental state of in more detail ... .. "False! It also lacks some key elements. In this type of film, there is usually a kind of warning. Do not do this or that can happen, which adds to the tension, but nothing like it here. It just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens, and then ends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of very fierce competition in this genre and a Dan Reed hat for trying, I have no problem with his staging abilities but in terms of writing .. I would say that next time he should stick to the type of movie he is doing instead of trying to be too smart and he will have a quality film on his film. hands.
