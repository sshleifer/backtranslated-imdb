I came out of this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better. Instead of what should be a captivating and tense story of a boy's struggle for survival in the wild, then a National Geographic documentary meets an advertisement for the American Columbia sport. preparing for a plane trip to see his father. His mother accidentally gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a starting gift (what's wrong with a Rubik's Cube?), Knowing how soon he will need it. Once in the air, the pilot of the plane (a Ned Beatty cameo) suffered a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashed into a lake. Extremely lucky to walk (or rather to swim) virtually unscathed, Brian must find shelter, food and hope of being rescued. <br /> <br /> This is where the main problem of the film begins. By the very nature of Brian's loneliness, Jared has very few lines to talk about and so the film would have had to compensate by increasing the tension of each scene. Instead, he is represented walking, sitting, etc., with a feeling of minimal danger. As a result, we rely too much on the backtracking of the parents' difficult marriage, a source of tension. These scenes only hinder and do not add much to the story. Even worse, from time to time Jared ?? his face covered with mud - lets out a scream or two primals, which evoke unfortunate parallels with "Predator". Speaking of misfortune, we could have done without the sight of his mule, but it probably helped keep him warm at night. <br /> <br /> Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffective performance as a mother. She and her father have very little impact in the film. For example, we are never shown how they react to the announcement of Brian's disappearance, how they could organize rescue attempts, and so on. This is just one of the sources of tension that filmmakers would have had to explore instead of spending so much time on the events that occurred before Brian left.
