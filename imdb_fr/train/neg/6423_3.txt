The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown, my finger was shaking on the remote, about to turn around to look at something else. The premise of two writers, who lost their chance, living in a "storage space" was slightly amusing, but painfully bland. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - The guy from the cinema, who lives in the park and sleeps in a toilet, gave me hope and I decided to him leave a few more minutes. And then a few more until Kristy Swansons is portrayed as a budding director and a borderline nymphomaniac, added a little spice. His strong acting performance has strengthened his presence beyond a simple, much-anticipated inclusion. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the obvious consequences of a low budget on the film with badly shot scenes, a stuttered pace and sloppy management of some of the moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail and me being one of those who also talk about two guys with a dream, but who have lost their chance. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the archives of the "Terrible film" and almost move it into the archives "could have been a cult movie". I laughed at the scenes with Joe Pantoliano. In particular, the penultimate scenes of the house of characters terribly cliche, but still funny, rich but messed up, where the story unfolds to its last moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how great Tinseltown was on stage and although filmmakers do their best to translate that into celluloid, it just did not work and, while I laughed hard at some scenes and linings, I think the first 30 minutes had blunted my senses and my expectations. a degree I would have laughed at anything. <br /> <br /> Unless you're stuck for a coffee coaster, do not take it if you see it in a bargain bucket.
