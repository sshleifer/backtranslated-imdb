Normally, I would have given a score of 6 to this movie. He's talking about a very important subject and he's doing it relatively well - despite Katie Wright, which is a feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I do not know at all if she was In fact, she was prompted to play the character in this way or is naturally irritating, but she did a great job in making me impossible to take care of from Lexi. She has no other dimension than her helplessness, helplessness and lack of self-control, and her ability to moan. I can understand how a girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorders have spiraled out of control would be helpless, frightened and suffering. However, Wright's entire performance is based on incessant weeping and crying, the rest complaining. I could not help but think that the problem of this particular girl was not caused by the demon Bulimia, but by the fact that she had no spine. I doubt that this is the purpose of the film.
