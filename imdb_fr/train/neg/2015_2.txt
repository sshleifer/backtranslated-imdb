I was really looking forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I'm crazy about aviation and I have a serious love affair with helicopters. I do not like this program because it takes fantasy to an incredible level. The world speed record for helicopters was established at 249 mi / h by a Westland Lynx several years ago. The 1960s Lockheed AH56A was the only helicopter to be so fast. He hit more than 300 and was a combined helicopter, which means he had a push at the end of his fuselage. <br /> <br /> In summary, no helicopter can fly more than 275 because of the principle of flying wing rotation. And the Bell 222, the "actor" who portrayed Airwolf was not very fast, even by helicopter standards. And the production did not stay very long. <br /> <br /> A film titled "Blue Thunder" appeared at this time and was much more realistic.
