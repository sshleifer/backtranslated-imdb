There was such a craze in a televised show with Bill Shatner ... and especially in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to be in tune to see what was going on. was about the new game show. What a desappointment! As so stenoically and nasally says Ben Stein, "wooww". <br /> <br /> The only thing that pleases in this show is the fact that you knew everything would be over. It's been a whole hour since it's like going to the dentist ... you end up looking at the clock according to what you think are 10-minute intervals, only to discover that only a minute has passed (but seemed like an eternity) since you glanced at the clock So why did not I just switch channels? Well, probably for the same reason that most other people do not have it ... out of pure optimism. I mean, nobody really wants * to think * that a show with Bill Shatner could actually be so bad. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought it was the kind of vehicle that showcased William Shatner's talents. My main complaint was that the decor was so dark. Looking at him, I felt depressed. You wanted to keep a little excitement, but it just was not there. There was not even enough light on the set to give the audience an impression of energy (which you could not even see). <br /> <br /> Dear network, people do not watch game shows to remedy their insomnia. ..they watch game shows to be excited and have a good time. Please, make us all happy and lose it in the safe.
