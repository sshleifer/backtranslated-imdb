Style but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as he wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another form of film that deals with the difficulties of realization. A young filmmaker is hired to finish a 60s science fiction film entitled Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella or Diabolical Danger. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is an anxious filmmaker. It's not a hack, it's an artist. The film he wants to do is a diary of his life. Not really original. <br /> <br /> All characters outside Jeremy Davies are as thin as rice paper. Characters that could be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director are presented and then shown at the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This film is full of magic but when compared to other movies about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2, it's in comparison. These movies are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. These movies have lessons that apply externally <br /> <br /> The film is meant to be comic and campy, but it's just a derivative and there is not a fun scene. Filmmakers describe it as an impulse, but what is the satirical target? The actors say it's a tribute, but I think I'd prefer a full version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly amused by the scenery, as evidenced by the visual humor of a sci-fi film. But he can not say why we should have fun. <br /> <br /> Outside the sci-fi movie, it's just a jumble. There are errors of continuity, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after having already been chosen. <br /> <br /> It is not because he has a scene that the filmmaker is confronted to the critics who complain of the lack of history, of a point, of a scene where he confesses a skill empty does not mean that he addressed himself to these critics. <br /> <br /> I guess if your Roman Coppola is able to make a film about an idealist filmmaker, anxious, who does not know what he means and ends up saying nothing. In this sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I would watch it at Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. Watch the 15-minute movies named Codename: Dragonfly included on the DVD, then send them back.
