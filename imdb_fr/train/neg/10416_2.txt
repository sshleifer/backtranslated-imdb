Before seeing this film, I would have said that I loved everything Kathy Bates did. Now, it's all-less one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should have told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, ignorant or clich√©. Ditto for the stereotypes of Randy Quaid. Henry Thomas, who is not a powerful enough player to carry this soaked mess, is the only element that redeems well. If you like the country, you will appreciate the landscape. That's the best I can say. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of independent and offbeat movies, but it's just awful.
