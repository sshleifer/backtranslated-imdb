Mighty Morphin Power Rangers must be the worst television series ever made. There is no conspiracy, just a group of stupid costumed children using martial arts dressed in second-class spandex outfits. <br /> <br /> The special effects look like the 70s. The costumes look like a piece of bad comedy, and the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is worse than the TV show are the toys, just second-rate plastic garbage given to our kids. <br /> <br /> There are much better shows to watch for your children! <br /> <br /> Try to give your kids something like Nickelodean, these shows actually have some intelligence behind them, unlike the Power Rangers.
