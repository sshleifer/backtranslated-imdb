This movie really drove me crazy because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've been living in Iowa for 29 years and I know people do not have the southern accent here. This film is about a guy who makes methamphetamine and I do not know the real plot or what the movie is supposed to be. It contains a pretty staggering graphic use of drugs and it's really insulting, so see these people using methamphetamine as if it was sugar. I lost my brother because of methamphetamine and this film makes me sick because he glorifies drugs. The movie looks cool to use the drug, but I was happy in the end when the guy almost crossed the borders. I also know that most women who are victims of traumatic rape do not want to have sex with their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I wanted to suggest a movie about drugs.
