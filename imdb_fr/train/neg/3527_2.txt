I had to see this because it looked like a scary place: the prisoners find a magic book, oh yes! claustrophobic terror ensues, and so on. <br /> <br /> but there did not seem to be a story to accompany the good idea. rather than crippling / physical horror, it relied on effects in open fire and OTT body horror, which were not scary at all if you were over 12 years old. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters killed for nothing but counting bodies. wasting good characters - which was the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> obviously a small budget, which does not spoil anything, the film does not really go anywhere, and - I think I'll say it - needs a Hollywood remake. you simply lose interest in this version. This is certainly not in the same category as other French films released in recent years, like Cremson Rivers, which are at least viewable / entertaining, Malefique really is not at the end. and I bet you can guess the end before watching the movie. really disappointing - impossible to recommend.
