Yet another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits arguing. This time, the travelers of the future arrived in 1992 and recruited a few people to accompany them until 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving the future Japan from destruction. But after accomplishing this task, the time travelers turn out to be a group of double crossers whose own creature is unleashed and without Godzilla can stop it ?? Eek! This sounds very ridiculous, and probably, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks good too. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just garbage rather than pleasant garbage, and the film proves to be as dull as its predecessors. Watch out for Spielberg's joke.
