I have never seen a film as bad as this one. It's supposed to be a "fun" movie, but the only joke is at the beginning, and it's not funny. If you like that kind of film, then you might be able to give it a vote of 2. If it had the necessary votes, it would really belong at the bottom of the list. <br /> <br />
