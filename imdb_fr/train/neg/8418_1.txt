Yes, there is great performance here. Unfortunately, this happens in the context of a movie that does not seem to have a clue what it does. During the first 45 to 60 minutes, all music is interpreted realistically. Suddenly, about an hour later, the characters who, until then, had always spoken, suddenly began to sing. To further complicate matters, a little further, out of nowhere, they actually discuss for about 15 minutes, then seem to abandon this idea and move on, like a number starting in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with an invisible and massive string section. In addition to this inconsistency in the use of music, there is the manifest inability of composers to actually write music in the style that is supposed to be described. While the first two tracks mimic the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the movie is just a (bad) Broadway show music. Then, there is the sheer nonsense of a group doing a bad imitation of the Jackson family and Eddie Murphy moving from Little Richard to James Brown through Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder, I could not help laughing out loud. It was clearly one of those films that allowed me to appreciate the little time I spent on earth and the resentment of having lost two hours watching this movie.
