A disorder really confused and incomprehensible. Most things in the movie look more or less like 1987, but there are also some futuristic things, like the policeman's ray gun. And this car! The director seemed to be in love with colored lights. The only really notable performance was the girl who was playing Valerie, but since there was no list of actors, I do not know what actress it was. This one is worth to miss. Grade: F
