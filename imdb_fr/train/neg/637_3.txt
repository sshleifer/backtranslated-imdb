The Good Earth is by no means a great movie, it's really ordinary. It may have been different in the 1930s, but who would want to see a farmer's life? It's not very interesting for me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do a great job as a comedian, but the film has been going on for far too long. I could have told you the end of this film by the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni) is a small farmer who does not want to be like his father turns out to be exactly like him. Both fall in love with their wife as they are on their death bed. The film is a complete 360 ​​from one generation to the next. Moreover, this film did not have good characters or amusing acts, it was simply depressing to last as a farmer in times of crisis.
