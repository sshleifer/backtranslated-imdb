Vipul Shah did a really impressive job as a filmmaker in the past. "Waqt - The Race Against Time" and "Namaste London" were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His last outing as a filmmaker "London Dreams" is his weakest career. <br /> <br /> "London Dreams" has a mediocre story, it tells how success turns friendship into hatred. Okay, that has potential, but when you look at "London Dreams," you wonder what's going on? This film may have the worst climax of recent times. Vipul Shah the writer puts Vipul Shah to the post of director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is terrible. How can anyone forgive someone who has decided to destroy you? I do not want Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask for forgiveness from his diaper mate, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he arrives in India, rather than slapping or mistreating him, Salman greets him with his Baja group and says he was the reason behind the whole fiasco? Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as GOD? If so, that you have completely failed. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is: Would you like to welcome a person who has destroyed you with such a welcome? Write what you feel, do not deceive us {the public}, we are sensitive enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> It's a musical but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. Not a single song stays in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is superb though. He wears the film on his shoulders and does really well in emotional scenes. But once again his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him look like a delay in the end. Ajay is also good, but Salman has completely obscured him. Asin is wasted, and what does a great talent like Om Puri do in this film? Rannvijay ham, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is fine as a vampire. <br /> <br /> Overall, this dream remains a dream!
