I gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have come up with a formula to replicate any organism. In their lab (a dilapidated warehouse of L.A.), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies comes in to steal the formula and the rest of the film is a never ending pursuit. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (a rubber puppet) comes off and starts to clear the throw. He has the incredible ability to sneak between two or three feet without anyone noticing, then quickly bites his head. <br /> <br /> One of the cast members escapes into a police car and spends the rest of the film driving through the aimless city. Her mental capacity is such that she can not even use the radio. She never tries to go to a subway station or a donut shop and seems desperately lost. <br /> <br /> The T-Rex is wreaking havoc throughout the city. Battles and burning buildings (cardboard models) explode, but only one police car, or army, or anyone else ever shows up. Such activity must be banal in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that a sequel is not planned.
