It could have been a rather entertaining film, but instead, he is lining up with other misfits like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the film food chain. If they had played this movie with a leaning tongue, it could have been a very entertaining movie, like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon played it with a tongue stung in places, but more often upright. <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is a small community besieged by mutant slugs. There is a toxic waste dump left near a sewer line that turns slugs into aggressive monsters eating meat - although monsters move slowly and can be crushed under your boot. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people who seem ready to fight the slugs while the sheriff and the mayor say they are crazy. The highlight is a burst of laughter - involuntary to that - which makes you think how stupid the scenario of slug destruction is (actors and screenwriter). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ (No new pitch Simon seems to play the gore elements, but the dialogue is straightforward.If Simon had worked with a clever scenario (a scenario with lots of characters and quirky characters, it could have been a cult film.) <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You will not be disappointed here.) We have a lot of scenes of explosive chest cavities as well as a big head explosion in the middle of a good restaurant Italian blood and guts, Many horror moviegoers appreciate this place, but also corpses of people who have been cleaned by slugs and many scenes of slug destruction). <br /> <br /> > ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a drug and he delivers his features with a facial expression suggesting that he knows how absurd this movie is.) Ndeavor is, Kim Terry, as a woman, does a decent job, even if it does not only a few things beyond the guts Hold his face screaming. The "teenagers" were all horrible actors - without exception. This film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs! <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Two teenage girls are naughty in bed before being shipped - in a badly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's room (male and female nudity here).
