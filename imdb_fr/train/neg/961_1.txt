GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A NORTH WOMAN) is nowhere. <br /> <br /> This short story (a little over sixty minutes) is not as inspired by the classic westerns of spaghetti as it is a scam of THE QUICK & THE DEAD spaghetti) by Sam Raimi, which has been integrated into a contemporary decor. In QUICK & DEAD, the character of Sharon Stone seeks revenge for the ugly sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, while a kid, placed in his hands the fate of his father (a brief monochrome of Gary Sinise); she accidentally shot him in the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by the agile Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge for the infamous Mr. Tojo (played with a minimalist appeal of Shingo Tsurumi), who, when she was a kid, placed the leaves his father in his hands; she let her foot slip from the clutch and her dear father was drawn and cut into quarters by a semi-trailer truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo sadly paralyzes Saki with ?? Well, I will not spoil you in case you decide to look at it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki ?? a pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's "nameless man" ?? goes up in the city ?? Basically, there is a car shop and a tavern next to a US military base, so I guess that's enough for a city? corrupted by Tojo, the local crime leader has a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing as a true bounty hunter, Saki confronts local gunmen in shootings whose choreography offers more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the movie, Saki has endured her share of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but she is up to the task? on his knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending ?? and defeat all his enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask her where she gets the rocket launcher. Just look for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The image quality is average for the DVD output. There is a granular quality with several sequences, but overall, it is not a bad transfer. The quality of the sound sometimes leaves a little to the imagination, but, again, it is not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> It's rather a bad movie.
