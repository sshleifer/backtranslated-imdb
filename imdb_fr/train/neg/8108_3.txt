After reading the book, which made a lot of sense for me, the movie did not give me the feeling the book was saying. It makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book because he managed to do something else. Either that or it's just bad. More importantly, where is the lightness ?! From the very first scene, the music engulfs most dialogues and emotions, and this continues throughout the film. I think the producers thought that leaving a lively music playing throughout the film, the story would be light, but they completely failed here. Instead, the music manages to give everything the film gives, "in a way that dramatizes the events so that we focus on them, so that everything seems really heavy. <br /> <br Another example of the failure of this adaptation is to embellish the story by making it more dramatic.In the film, we see Franz overtake Tomas in the street, who goes to Sabina.The introduction of this meeting / Impromptu passage, which is certainly not mentioned in the book, gives the story of Tomas more meaning than it makes light. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worse, but it could have been done because the book just does not convert well into a movie, that is Kundera's style, which leads us to wonder if all the generous critics on this site wrote with their experience book AND movie e n head rather than writing only on the film. A film that is as long as decompressing. For those who have not read the book yet, I simply recommend reading this. For those who do, I must say that you will simply waste your time and that you will probably end up writing similar warnings here: stay clear.
