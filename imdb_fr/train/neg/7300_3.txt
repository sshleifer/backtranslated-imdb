This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends catches a horrible virus that eats the flesh. Suddenly, friends fight in a desperate attempt not to contract the disease themselves. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a horrible film. On the one hand, he tries to be several genres at once. Is it supposed to be a tribute, a slasher, a black comedy or a horror movie with an unintentional comedy? Nobody can say. There is a serious scene in the first and a second alter, it becomes funny. When the film tries to be funny, the humor is pretty bland, excluding the end. The end pleased me a lot. <br /> <br /> But aside from the end, I was pretty disappointed and disgusted. Violence is at hand, she looks more at the screen than fear. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What are we supposed to draw from it? That same girl would bite one of the characters. Was it supposed to be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were decent and others very amateurish. I did not care about most of the characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was horribly done. As a horror movie, I did not know what it was. I did not find it funny, tense, or scary. In the end, you remain indifferent by thinking: "What have I just lived?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
