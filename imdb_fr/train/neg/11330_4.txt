"Giant" is one of the most boring and longest gear ever seen in Hollywood. Many scenes seem totally false and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production. A central idea of ​​this movie, that a farmer would never resist drilling oil on his land, is absurd, and I know it because I'm from Houston. Some scenes, especially Dean who serves coffee Taylor, buy this film otherwise boring. For a much more accurate and interesting description of how modernism has transformed Texas ranches, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show".
