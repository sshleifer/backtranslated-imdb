Other critics do not feel that this film stinks because it is ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is no worse than the meat trade in the United States. United States or the Scottish slaughter of haggis), it stinks because it is pretentious of the scythe that gives modern art a bad reputation. That said, there are great pictures, but there are some great pictures in an average bus if you use your imagination, so this is not a reason to go see these nonsense. What happens in the film runs very slowly and is often accompanied by a soundtrack that looks like a emptied cat, and then, when you think it's over, it's all over again. I saw him in a porn cinema in Rome that had been hired for the weekend to show Barney's films, which is an admirable and clever way to retrieve what was once a local pretense for old men. brigade, but if the trendy young men and Bjork's older fans, stroking their beards, were honest, everyone could have had more fun if they had just shown one of the porns!
