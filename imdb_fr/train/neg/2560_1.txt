Well, I watched that last night and the only thing that did not make it all that terrible was that it was simple. There was no way to beat around the bush to say that this kid was the Antichrist. However, the film was just badly written. For example, they never explained how they turned the dentist's incident into an "accident" or how the police officer miraculously found himself at home in time to save the child when the police had not still been called. The scenes of death were really bad and not at all funny. The kid they chose to play the Antichrist was boring and they could have really picked a better kid. Just do not waste your time watching this.
