Okay. So, there are not really many good movies around. Recent gems such as American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 are not usually so close to each other. But my boy (!) This film counteracts quality. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought they were doing. Are the financiers of this world so easily convinced to finance such a quantity of ****? I can just see him now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes, he's cute as a button and was very good in Shakespeare in Love, and we have Rhys Ifans, that's not cute but cool in Notting Hill: we're going to mix a really mediocre score, some forgettable post-Britpop tunes, some brains of hemlock roots and lizards, and you have the worst movie of this new millennium. me, it will be difficult to do something as serious as this in the next thousand years. "<br /> <br /> The bank -" I like it! All sex useless? Bad camera movements? And what about the worst accents on this side of Devil's Own? "<br /> <br /> Producer -" Yes, we have a lot. "<br /> <br /> The bank -" That's good look great, where are we going to sign? "<br /> <br /> Please.
