What has ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could have been made by any school available at the movies ... and in fact, they probably would have done a better job. They would have at least put half of a thought in the appalling scenario. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who has crossed a kind of wormhole and landed on a planet ruled by monkeys. (panting!) Except this time, the monkeys resound with groaning dialogues, absurd plots and striking special effects that constantly reinforce me in the idea that this money could have been used for about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe. <br /> <br /> Even though I appreciate Tim Roth's superb acting talent, his performance as the leader of the evil monkey monkeys, Thade, is nothing more than an intense composition of heavy breathing and heavy. Fortunately for him, makeup allows him, as an actor, to maintain a certain dignity and most bullshit dialogues are hidden behind his moans and sniffles. <br /> <br /> And, alas, the tradition of Hollywood still worthy of taking the male and the women lead and connect them in the end without development of the relationship or the cause. And the "haha, we are so smart, are not we?" Hollywood mixes references from the original POTA to this one. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this, spend the night calling friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman' or even, to a lesser extent, 'Sleepy' Hollow 'and remember the time when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... no shame and ridicule.
