Okay, I recorded this show on TV and I missed the beginning. The film took about 10 seconds in the tracks (I guess), so if something happened before I missed it. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Mark Hammill is in the movie, I have not seen it. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis and, of course, Stephen King, acting as a servant of the really ugly graveyard. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is beautiful outside the scenes where she has the cat's head or is in the middle of the alien -up. <br /> <br /> Even with the first titles, he has never really explained very well what are somnambulists or where they come from. In the title sequence, I suppose they are feline bipeds that draw their life force from humans. I guess they live a long time and these two are probably the last of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add to that a very big dose of incest (yes, I thought it was a bit suspicious too), change of shape, killer and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad story that has no explanation behind the 2 main characters and far too many cameos to try to distract you from the simple fact that it is not enough explained to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
