I watched this film only for the scenery. He was filmed in an old hotel where a friend owns shares. The plot was predictable, the acting was at best mediocre, the alarms were all rude, no real alarms. I do not remember much of the plot, and I think it's because there was none. Not a lot of people to remember. They did not even use the hotel to its full potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk in the bay for a quarter of an hour, which is really strange in the morning or late at night when the wind blows through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best The way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward in the action scenes (and I use this term vaguely) and pause at the beauty of the surroundings!
