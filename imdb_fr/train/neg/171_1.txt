I thought Hedy Burress (who had managed to escape the watery tomb of the first part) would be in the second part. I suppose not. I just think they should kill her as in Friday 13th Part 2 (you know what I mean). <br /> <br /> This movie like Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2 has been watching movies in a movie. <Br/> <br /> It was PURE CRAP! The whole movie in a movie shit. <br /> <br /> BAD STAY!
