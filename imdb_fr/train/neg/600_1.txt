...... in a horror movie that is. First, let's start with Kate. His main goals are to get fucked by George Clooney, to look good and finish, but most of all, to screw up everything. I must love him. She had about three good chances to end this illness but ..... instead, she ran. I mean, she did not want to bring Guy for 10 minutes and when she did, it was too late. I mean, the guy tried to rape her. I can not get into those movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who completes everything she has met in one night. The film continued. And therefore lost all his credibility.
