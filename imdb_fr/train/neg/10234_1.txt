I will keep it short; Thanks to Greg for helping me to formulate this succinctly: Captivity is talking about a guy who drugs a girl's drink, imprisons and tortures her, then pretends to be a prisoner to have sex with her. she. This is the only twist and punchline of the film. It's a torture like a slow-motion rape. And it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad that it's good; it's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, although some have been tempted to see it because it is so vil. Why did not PERSON have the courage to stand up and say, "It's bullshit, and that's why," it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these peddlers.
