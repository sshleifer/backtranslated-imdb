I could not even bring myself to watch this movie until the end. I can not comment on the story because I did not watch the entire movie and the reason I could not see it was because of the "actors". Firstly, most of the time, they looked stiff and I'm sure their scripts were in their hands quite out of the box - but that's a minor problem. The main problem I have with the actors is not really their fault ... whoever is shooting this movie! Come on, this movie was released in 2003 ... I thought that teenage teens playing in their late twenties had gone out of fashion to the new wave ?! I can not watch a movie that one of the first lines of a man older than me is "I'm 17!" How can we take this seriously ????? Do not be a victim of this film, go for a walk for 90 minutes and you will get much more than this film could give.
