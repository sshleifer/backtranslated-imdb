OK, it's very rare that I complain about something that I get for FREE. So, I guess this film pushed me beyond that limit. I saw it for free at the Hollywood cemetery and I left very very disappointed. A member of the audience asked the director to use Native American references simply as "bookends" instead of being better integrated into the film. Basically, he says everything about what the film failed. <br /> <br /> ABORIGINAL AMERICAN REFERENCES --- Amerindian American references were truly inappropriate and artificial. It is obvious that this director and writer has tried to tackle an arena in which they have never played before. They should have kept to the old adage that "write something you know". If they are really familiar with that, it certainly has not been shown in the film or the beauty of this unique culture has not been brought to justice. <br /> <br /> Clich√©s and ON THE NOSE: I agreed to see this film because it was an independent film. So I held him to higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. Even before being widely broadcast, I was already excited about the success of this film. Unfortunately, I could not say as much about the "expiry date". "Sunshine" led us to cliche incidents, but the filmmakers were so smart about the approach that the result would lead us in a different direction by avoiding the trap of being a "cliche". This film however had no way of not falling into the trap because it was already TRAPPED from the beginning. The antics of the psycho mother, the Hendrix couple, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say it, but the best and the worst film I've seen this year were both independent. "Little Miss Sunshine" being the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say the opposite. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers for having been so successful from their family members in the cemetery.
