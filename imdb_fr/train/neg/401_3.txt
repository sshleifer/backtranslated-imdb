That's what I found myself saying over and over again in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this excuse for a movie. First, the computer effects are absolutely breathtaking! These computer wizards really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, however ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters acts realistically, especially in the abominable third act (I promise not to let go, but trust me, that not worth keeping a secret!). Lots of laughter in the film come unintentionally, as when they try to explain that the eyelids of an invisible man do not work. Please, give more credit to viewers than that !!! <br /> <br /> Some sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? Nobody could catch you! These problems were treated in a much smarter way in the classic movie The Invisible Man of 1933. There is one scene of violence in particular that is incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned later. If more attention had been given, the mad scientist of Kevin Bacon might have a little more sense. <br /> <br /> The film would actually be much more successful as porn, since the premise could be realized in a unique and interesting way. But this job ... will see something else. Or do not do it and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
