It looks like one of those movies we think we should like, but I did not do it. It seemed too difficult to be "artistic". Any flash, without content. There are very beautiful scenes, and each of them is nice to watch, but do them all together and it's a tough job to get through. I praised this because of the rave reviews on the video card and the fact that I am a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit pretentious and sometimes boring.
