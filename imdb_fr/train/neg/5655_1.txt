Egyptian films have a lot of movies with a high level of drama or romance or comedy or action, even sports ... Nudity is forbidden in Egyptian movies .. When I saw this movie, I I felt downcast ... Stupid story .. Naked actress .. Bad action .. Horrible and terrible colors .. Dear friend .. If you want to see a big Egyptian movie ... Simply: Stay in shape "Ziab la Ta 'Kohl AL lam' ... We have great films in Egypt ... We have a great actor who won a world award like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great directors like "Yousef Shahin ", so believe me Pall .. You do not need to see this movie ..
