A recent article by a woman claiming to have a military origin contained the following comment: "The life of a woman is no more valuable than that of a man". <br /> <br /> This politically correct mantra is not as true as the biology show story. Societies have managed to recover from the heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to wage a new war in 1939 despite the 1914-1918 war in which more than two million of its men were killed. During the Triple Alliance War in South America (1865), Paraguay attacked three neighboring countries until almost all of its male population was wiped out but became a stalemate during the war. the Chaco war in 1932 against a much larger Bolivia. <br /> <br /> No society, however, has ever survived the loss of its female population. It is only when the very life of the nation is at stake that women are invited to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but since then it has never considered creating joint combat units for its defense forces, despite the popular image of the young Israeli soldier. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane" is a Hollywood fluff.
