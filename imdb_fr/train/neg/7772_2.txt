It's a humble film. There is no real plot. We are never aware of motives other than wealth. The characters are among the worst actors ever to be filmed. The threat seems to be supernatural, but it is then controlled by these three older people. Why do they do what they do? to scare other members of the group? I do not know. There is fog coming from a fog machine rolling in the hallways and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Does he do anything? I do not know. There is nudity for herself. I'm always surprised to see this in such old movies. Things have really settled in this regard these days. Anyway, people run like hens, ready for the ax. They do not have a plan; no resources; no nothing. There are about five stupid climaxes in the movie. Who are these people and "is" there a ghost or a demon. What happened to other people? I challenge anyone to tell me with confidence. What a mess.
