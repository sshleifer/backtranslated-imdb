I'm sorry to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (for example, the use of color was absolutely sensational), it was rather boring and disturbing (see incest father / son). <br /> <br /> What's more, the music is totally absent, and if you think about it These wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway's movies) will allow you to imagine how much it makes a difference. <br /> <br />
