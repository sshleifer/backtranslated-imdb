Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who obviously tries to achieve. "A walk on the moon" seems to have borrowed from other films of better quality. This story takes place in the late 1960s in a summer station for working-class Jews not far from Woodstock. The treatment of the screen by Pamela Gray does not have much to do, which is why Mr. Goldwyn decided to tackle this film from his first attempt at staging. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends time at the station. We see them arrive at the small bungalow that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, only comes for the weekend; he works in what appears to be a small family business that mainly repairs televisions. In a few days, the first man will walk into space. The excitement is obvious. <br /> <br /> The women of Kantrowitz are left behind. Pearl, Marty's wife and her mother-in-law, Lilian, spend days without anything until the arrival of the "blouse salesman". Pearl sails and she finds much more than a shmatte; she also gets the seller. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sex life. After two children, Pearl, who looks sexy and has a high libido, is ready for extra-marital entertainment. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise of the film, which becomes a soap opera when the girl, Alison, decides to play on the phone and go to the nearby Woodstock Festival, where, horror of horrors she sees her own mother kissing with the blouse seller! What is a girl to do? Well, stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily gathered at the bedside of the little son when he is stung by wasps and the seller comes to apply a cure at home and that dad is called from the city ​​the young stallion. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she went to do later "Unfaithful", which is the high-end version of this dud. Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who addresses his customers alone whispering something in the ear! Liev Schreiber in the role of Marty, the cuckold husband, does not have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebel Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unfortunate Nana, who would like to stay in town to watch her soap operas instead of attending one of her own scenes that is played in her own backyard! <br /> <br /> or start the DVD on TV when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to laugh, or twice the movie.
