It saddens me to be able to rate a movie with many of my favorite actors, venues, and genres, such as Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC, and political thriller, but "The Sentinel" really beats down. It's as if they had a good idea in their head, that they signed the right distribution, that they did great pictures of the city, then they took a vacation leaving the rest of the team improvising others. And I'd like to be able to attribute that to another bland performance of Basinger (not only do I think it's one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I still say, more than a decade later, that it was the one and only actor in the film to win an Oscar for "LA Confidential" But that was not the only problem Sutherland, whom I love so much that Jack Bauer in '24' is playing Jack again. misses his old days "A Time to Kill" or "Some Good Men." Douglas certainly took a break and telephoned it Plot: Someone, a traitor of the Secret Service, wants the death of President and Douglas is (randomly) being framed, will anyone believe it? In fact, no spoiler here: as fast as they came up with this mid-story intrigue, it's over before that you do not know, and why did someone want the death of the president? Will it be revealed in the following? It's intriguing, too many doors open and never closed, and The Sentinel too predictable. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but if you already know this type of movie or if you've just seen an episode of "Law & Order", you'll know everything at the beginning. Was it terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good and, although Sutherland is playing Jack again, he still has it.
