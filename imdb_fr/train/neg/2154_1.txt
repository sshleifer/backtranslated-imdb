Let me confess. I found this video used and bought because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. Besides the fact that the film was essentially a parody of special effects like "invisible-man" (very visible chains and other similar accessories), the scenario left no chance - in fact, it deviated - insulting all - WASP races and real or imaginary homosexuals. Each insult targeting a person in the script was either homophobic or racist, or both. It's starting to get on your nerves, with its trembling sound, hidden camera-style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is a bit of a surprise. But when you get there, you do not care. Too bad, it could be a good movie.
