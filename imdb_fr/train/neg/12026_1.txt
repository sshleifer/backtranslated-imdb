I really wish that when making a comedy, people really tried to make it funny. It's a movie you can watch, but nothing is special about it. After watching it, you will say that everything was fine. It was not boring to watch, but the audience should not laugh. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than a narrative o.k. This film wanted to be "Tootsie", but failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 in 10.
