This film rivals "Plan 9" as one of the most stupid movies of all time. Always be concerned when the same person is: 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Scriptwriter 5. Stuntman, and 6. Publisher. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did the 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western stuntmen. So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here's an EXAMPLE of the movie: In the movie, the sheriff must bring a witness to another city to protect himself. Of course, the bad guys find out and wait for them. What's happening? The good guys are on horseback and a gunshot sounds and hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us the bad guys, they are all sitting on a newspaper and chatting. What is the problem with this picture! <br /> <br /> I could go on. Maybe this movie was conceived as a comedy. If so, it did not work well either.
