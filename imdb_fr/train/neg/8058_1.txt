After seeing the hot Eliza Dushku in the very good Wrong Turn, I decided to choose this one instead of Return of the Living Dead, from all the movies. I have not seen it yet, but given one of the most acclaimed horror movies of all time, it's safe to say that I made the wrong choice. There is simply nothing to recommend to this film, and I'm talking about the cut supposedly superior to the killer. He did not even have the juicy sex appeal of mediocre poor movies like I know what you did last summer, Valentine or Urban Legend. It just made no sense, no excitement, very little interesting writing or convincing writing. The release date has apparently been postponed several times for about a year, and the reason is obvious. The whole film is presented as a set of meaningless scenes assembled randomly, without effect. If you want to see Dushku, turn wrong. I would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I do not think even that would have made this film lookable. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is awful here - he seems to lack intelligence and courage. It's enough on this one.
