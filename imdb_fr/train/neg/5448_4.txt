Doris Day never lets a bad script down. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Day gives 100% and comes out generally unscathed. This comedy, inspired perhaps by the breakdown of real life in New York in 1965, but adapted from a French play by Claude Magnier dating from the late 1950s, gives Doris little to do except to falsify his own picture in the second half, be funny sedative (which is fun because of the rotation given by Day to the situation). There are some fun lines here, but the staging of the material has obviously been postponed from the room ... and instead of creating fun incidents within the Big Apple, we find ourselves stuck in the suburbs. The co-stars of Doris (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) do not suit him, any more than the hairstyle informs that it carries. Nevertheless, it's not terrible, there are some big bursts of laughter and it is a must for the fans of the day. ** from ****
