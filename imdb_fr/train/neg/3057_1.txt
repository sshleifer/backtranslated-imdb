While "Santa Claus Conquers Martians" is generally cited as one of the worst films of all time, this Mexican-made 1959 film is so terrible that it makes "SCCM" look like "It's a life wonderful. " You have to wonder what the movie's authors thought; perhaps they thought it was an allegory of the Third World about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nah. . . They were just not very good. The same production company has created an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood" in which the obsession of the wolf for our heroine suggests undeniable allusions to pedophilia. (Maybe that was the inspiration for "Freeway".) Back to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old St. Nicholas resides in a geosynchronous orbit satellite (shades of "MST3K"); instead of elves, his toys are made by children chosen from around the world; and he had sophisticated spy gear to check which children were naughty and kind. The result is like a sweat shop in Orwellian outer space. It's enough to extinguish Christmas forever. This film and other low-rent Mexican children's films were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960s; It is no wonder that the sixties became such a turbulent period in American history. Baby boomers who were forced to support these "family" films as children would be just as eager to become revolutionary.
