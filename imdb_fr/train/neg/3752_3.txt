I grew up watching and loving TNG. I have just finished watching the full-length ST Voyager DVD series, which may have exacerbated my disgust for this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two series could not be more cruel. The idea might have been good if it had been used to further expand Riker's character, which would probably have made it possible to deal with VOY. They could have presented memories that would be "new" to the audience, rather than simply regurgitating old broadcast clips. The transitions of entry and exit between the "memories" and the "present" in this episode begin as a clich√© at the beginning and quickly become intolerable as the tired model wears out. Not the worst episode of my life.
