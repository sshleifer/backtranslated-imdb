Others have already commented on the "decline" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of selecting good projects (as he proved by starring "Exorcist III" of the same year), so why did he agree to appear in this film? Of course, it gives a crazy performance and the film is not downright bad; it's just without interest, interest, or attractiveness. It's three "too many". (* 1/2)
