If you were doing a genre film at the end of the 80's, you'd basically get one in 50 chance that it's under water or in a prison (unfortunately, we've never had a prison movie sub- Marine). Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole), murdered by Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), the leader of the mafia, is sentenced to death, right next to his brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Derek's problems, because Colonel Burgess (who is also the director), a rogue government agent (and a fool of the crowd), uses the prison as a testing ground for a new superbugs. This is the only film made by Saxon during his career. For a guy who has worked with tons of filmmakers, it seems that the only tips for which he has had advice are the ones that are cheap and italian. Of course, his budget is low, but that can not excuse staging on stilts, shooting blunders or awkward exposures in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon made it look a little bloody and he works in a hilarious nude scene (our role falls asleep during a prison riot to only fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, who looks like a beefier Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent at the top of the stoic bunch and Franciosa - who wears a very bad rug - is giving himself up as a clich√© gang leader. The ending takes place at Bronson Canyon, Marty McKee's favorite place. Retromedia released this DVD under the name ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
