1975 is an amazing movie and wonderful to watch. This is not because the fights are particularly inspired or because the film makes no sense. It's because the movie is so stupid and so overflowing that it's a camp classic - bad, but pleasantly bad. The film features a blind guy who has a frisbee-like device on a chain that cuts people's heads as he skillfully casts it on his enemies! Who cares that physics is impossible or that the film presents nonsense such as fighters with paper-mache arms long 12 feet or that the guy was blind! It's just a balloon watching from start to finish - and one of my "bad" favorite movies and great to do with friends. <br /> <br /> Because of this film, I was anxious to see THE FATAL FLYING GUILLOTINES (1977), but unfortunately, it turned out that it was not a sequel, but a bit of a counterfeit - taking up many of the ideas of the original, but neglecting to make the film coherent or observable. Of course, it's fun, but it's never close to MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE in entertainment. As in the original movie, there are strange flying devices that cut the head, but they are quite different - with circular saw blades and almost a mind of their own. There is no blind type either, but rather a group of villains who really have no depth and the audience does not understand exactly what happens in this dubbed version in English, because the plot is completely incomprehensible. However, at the same time, the action of the martial arts is very good. Even if it does not live up to the high standards of most Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba movies, the action is worth living despite the ridiculous and often confusing plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a film that martial arts fans will like it's a problem that others will probably turn off or hysterically laugh at instead of enjoy the action because the movie is so ridiculous. BUT, most importantly, it's never as funny and as interesting as the MASTER OF FLYING GUILLOTINE. Pity.
