My Take: A tired formula of Christmas comedy. The laughs are tired and the talents behind that seem to be too. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as much as the guy next door (although I often have a bad case of holiday blues), but it seems like it's just a dump for a series of comedies from Holiday that would be bad movies every day of the year, but it does not make them less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and * gulp * still count), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a parcel of land that would be comfortable with the Disney franchise of SANTA CLAUSE (except the sometimes brutal humor and "small" Helper of Santa Claus wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a premise of a joke that lasts 116 minutes. Of course, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where is he going? <br /> <br /> It's a shame. FRED CLAUS is lucky to have a cast that could make it a nice Christmas comedy that will probably dissolve with the snow, but it would have been so much better than that. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are inclined to believe that he is truly the long lost brother of Father Santa (Paul Giamatti), who has never grown old and invites his good brother to visit him. Ms. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant and, even worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to watch Santa closely, and his CECA is about to be closed. Hah! And guess who's playing Santa's mother! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Charlene, the help of Santa, John Michael Higgins is one of the goblins and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! I do not know if I would hire the casting or saber. Here we have some familiar faces to which we must add a touch of quality, but they do not have enough resources to work. <br /> <br /> As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS can find is Santa's brother. being his exact opposite and a joke about a DJ elf. I have to admit that a few laughs have involved Fred attending a famous brothers board group (where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the laughs begin and end there. Worse still, the film even succumbs to a sentimentality supposed to make us "feel good about ourselves" and give us a lesson on "what Christmas really means". Apparently, what Christmas means for Hollywood is to get as much money back from our Christmas shopping as possible. <br /> <br /> Note: ** out of 5.
