Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to get into a serious television report. When a job for which he prays has failed, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) also says sayonara. On his way home, Tim is surprised to discover that his home has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from Mars! Appellant Uncle Martin, Tim is quickly trying to help his new friend navigate life on Earth. But Martin has problems everywhere he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry, etc. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to gain time with Tim but the course of true love is not smooth in this case either. Soon, everyone on TV tracks Tim, hoping for a story about a real alien. What is a man to do? For those who loved the old TV show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this movie is not worthy of attaching the proverbial boots. It's really, undeniably horrible, without intrigue and an addiction to the supposed special effects that fall flat, too. Daniels is acceptable as a Terran, but Lloyd is simply terrible as a stranger, exaggerating a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, sets and production details. Even if your children see the cover and implore this movie, persuade them to choose another movie in the video store. Be assured that children and adults will find in this film a colossal mine, so opt for a night at the museum or around the world in 80 days.
