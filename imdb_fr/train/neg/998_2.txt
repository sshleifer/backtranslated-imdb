It's a shame when the generic film synopsis contains more information than the movie itself. The paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the film's page contains details that I could not glean from watching the movie. I found myself constantly backtracking to see what details I was missing and who could tell me what was going on (beep). Alas, in vain - this film leaves out monstrous pieces of history, if you could call it a story. It's as if they were trying to deceive us into thinking that there was some kind of film here, just filming enough to make a story look like and leave the rest to our imagination. Newsflash to the creators: I paid to watch you DO a movie. I can stay home and imagine intrigues and intrigues for free. And Rosario Dawson? It's someone to whom I have never paid enough attention to put the name in value, and I understand why. She had one of the most artificial performances I've ever seen for a main character in a movie, A or B. I said okay, maybe she did not really want the role, she just got a huge offer for a movie she was not in? False. She was on the list of producers. The next time you produce something, do not put yourself in mind if you can not act. If you really can, create a decent character to become. Also, someone here mentioned the White / Latino problem - yes, I hate to say it, but this film is considered an act of revenge against white university-aged men wearing baseball hats. This is what happens when there is nothing in the film that seduces the observer to the Latin characters. The character of Adrian looks like an arrogant idiot who is no better than the antagonist of the story. As for the character of Maya, she did not seem to be a real person. Anyway, I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even shot.
