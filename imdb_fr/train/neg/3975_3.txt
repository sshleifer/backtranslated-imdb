1st viewed 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with some extra kisses. It seems to me that girls are tired of this kind of thing and it will be interesting to know what will happen to them if they decide one day to separate and to go in their own way. In this episode of their adventures, they are trainees in Rome for a fashion designer who puts them directly in the mail room to learn what is hard work (I guess ..). In addition to typical flirtations with boys, there is nothing more than the Rome scenario until about the movie, when it is finally revealed why they get fired, then rehired, then rehired, and then reengaged. This is definitely done by people who do not understand the business world and it shows in their interpretation. Maybe the real world will be their next adventure (if there is one). Even my kids did not seem to care about this boring "adventure" imaginary. Let's see that they are probably only a few years old until their legal adults. We will see what happens next.
