These writings speak of the end of the plot, so do not read it if you have not seen this garbage. <br /> <br /> I found this garbage film in the horror section, which made me think it would be a horror. . If I owned a video store, I would put it in the BORING section. This film is so bad that it will give you the impression that you have lost your socks. <br /> <br /> This film contains countless shots of people driving as if it were scary. Well, I drive to work and come back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me, it's not scary. It starts even with 20 minutes of driving. Even the little child does it too. He turns and turns constantly. Why is it so scary to watch a little kid ride a bike for an hour? I think nothing and if you look at it, you will not think it either. <br /> <br /> The family in the car arrives in a large castle and receives a guided tour that consists of strolling constantly in search of kitchens. Then the man walks for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all happening and as you can see, it's bullshit.
