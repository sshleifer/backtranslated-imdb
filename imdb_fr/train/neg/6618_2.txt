GLOBAL PERFORMANCE: - Finally the long wait AAG strikes the screens. Unfortunately, this could not gradually fire the public. The first thing to do to talk about the movie is the idea of ​​remaking the powerful SHOLAY. And Varma made a good choice by changing the background of the film. If he repeats the same scenery of Ramghad, people will still say that there is nothing new in it. A different context is appreciable, but the way he presented it is not worthy. From the beginning of his career at SIVA in Telugu, he used the same lighting and the same kind of context. I seriously know that this guy Varma thinks about lighting or not, or maybe he has no other lighting technique than Gordon Willis GODFATHER. Everything is DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why would a body use so many Dutch angles and very close shots !!!!!!! The shooting division is lame. The characters could not carry emotion, the performances are not their mark, the narration is worse, the background is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz was not privileged in relation to his work. VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to sculpt the best characters of all times of Hindi cinema. There is no comparison between Gabbar and Babban. Babban is more psychopathic than mean, but he always has a little corner for his brother (it's a gift in this movie). Amitabhz's performance is not his mark. His appearance is pathetic. The scar on his nose symbolizes the wicked forgotten black and white cinema. Whatever they have ever worked on Babban is not a success. Babban is not a comparison with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first thing about this character is not to put the audience in suspense about his hands. If Varma did that, it would be like teaching ABCD to a bachelor's degree holder. It's good that he opened the secret early. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma could not use a great actor like Mohanlal to his mark. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with an improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory modifications and has been used according to the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body gets bored or at least does not consider these characters. The total failure of the film begins when the director can not work on the close friendship between our hero. These characters do not wear anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality deteriorates, decreases. AAG can totally be treated as a category C movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge, a city problem, which means a true friendship and a nuisance highly appreciated and amusing by Dharmendra. AAG has never worn emotion with his characters. The narration is too weak for the public to feel sympathy for the characters. Do not compare AAG with sholay, you still will not like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare to watch this movie. You will be burned alive at RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
