Corrupted Look at Kibbutz Life <br /> <br /> This film is less a cultural story about the life of a boy in a kibbutz, but about the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the film, the milkman in charge of the cows violates one of his calves. And everything is descending from there in terms of characters representing typical "kibbutznikim". In addition to the two main characters, a clinically depressed woman and her young son, each of the other members of the kibbutz is a crude caricature of the good. <br /> <br /> The story centers on how the kibbutz, as a kind of worship, slowly drives the mother and son into despair and inevitably follows. There is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. Each character / situation represents a horrible human vice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression, etc. For example, while the protagonist is a young boy of 12 years with a European look of striking beauty ?? his older brother is a typical kibbutz teenager with his "Jewish" physical appearance and brutal personality. He cares more about screwing up foreign volunteers than about the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers as rubbish. After his younger brother asked him to visit his dying mother who he had not seen for a long time because of his military service, he ordered: "Linda, go take a shower and I'll be in two minutes." <br /> <br /> There is another "good" character in this movie ?? a European stranger who plays the mother's boyfriend. When the rapist tries to hit the mother's son, the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. He is summarily expelled from the kibbutz and then for "violent" behavior against one of the members of the kibbutz. More hypocrisy: The French French woman who plays the role of the teacher preaches that sex can not take place before the age of 18, or without love and accounts for the actual act supposed to be humorous for the public, but just stupid. Of course, she kisses the head of the kibbutz in the fields, which in turn, kisses the boy's mother when his sanity deteriorates. <br /> <br /> The film describes the kibbutz as a kind of cult. The children are removed from their beds in the middle of the night and trained in a ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields supervised by the elders of the kibbutz. The mother apparently can not "escape" the kibbutz, although in reality everyone is / is always free to come and go as they please. The death of his father is a mystery, but rest assured, the kibbutz "led him" and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless and miserable characters who weigh on the mother and son. <br /> <br /> This is the essence of this film. One-dimensional characters, over-dramatization, stage performances, and an insidious message that tries to hit the audience's head ?? this life in the kibbutz was degrading, miserable and even mortal for those who were not "part of it". I'm sorry for the guy who made this movie ?? obviously, he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel that he has taken some kernels of truth about the life of the kibbutz and turned them into huge stereotypical atomic bombs.
