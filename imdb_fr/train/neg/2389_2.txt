Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a gypsy (and incredibly fat) young woman who hitchhikes across the country, finally finding her true place in a group of illuminated cowgirls by peyote on a ranch dedicated to the conservation of the Whooping Crane. Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, whether she has her thumb or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire has no main target and just slips on the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but it's not about the public). The notorious box office flop was not ignored so much that it was ignored, and we understand why: it's a series of sketches in search of a screenplay, and the performances, the director's touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a point on the highway trying to be driven, but that's about what makes the kibosh on Phoenix's career. The writer Buck Henry (who did not write this, but should have done so) gives the most assured performance as a doctor who works on one of those thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
