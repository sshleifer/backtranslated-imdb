It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese movies and I think another film by the same director, the 80,000v electric dragon, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to love this movie - Asano is a great actor and the screenplay was extremely appealing. but I did not find anything entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> The film takes forever so that nothing happens. and the effects used by the director - such as constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - only added to my growing boredom about the fact that the plot was so slow and the actors were excessively excessive. much of the boredom was the result of unnecessary superfluous additions - like an hour spent on asano carving statues of Buddha and proclaiming that he was not worshiping anything. it does not add anything to the plot. Another Japanese moviegoer and I are constantly checking the time. we could not believe this movie was as bad as it was. and the finale was awful. I thought that the director would at least try to reward the viewer for having managed to get through, but unfortunately, I was wrong.
