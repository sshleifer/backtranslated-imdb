It may be the worst movie of all time and it may be worth it for that reason alone. Streisand is incredibly amazing as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is tortuous, featuring Barbara recounting some of the weakest mockers ever filmed. And do not even get me started on the plot. You will actually get more laughs from this movie than many comedies, because it's so awful. Streisand's unbridled selfishness, thinking he could raise this fucking smoke to a height of Oscar, led to this catastrophe. I'm sure the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hated this movie and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This film is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of "The Sound of Music" read back on an old turntable. It's really so bad. I am surprised that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this film at the level it was intended for.
