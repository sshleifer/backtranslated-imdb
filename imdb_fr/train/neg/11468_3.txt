I do not know who got the idea that orcas kill people, criticize and destroy things for revenge, but my god is nonsense. Orcs are certainly not the cold-blooded killer that this movie claims to show them ... it's silly. Orcs are extremely smart, do not get me wrong, but I doubt they know and understand a concept like revenge. So, I have to say that all I got from this movie was to show how absurd it was. So it amused me at least a bit. Personally, I would recommend going to see Jaws if you want to see an Animal-Killing-Humans movie. But if you're like me and want to laugh at something so far from realism, then I invite you to continue. :RE
