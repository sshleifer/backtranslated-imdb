Well, I could not even really appreciate this film for its cult values. It is an action film filmed by the director of "Commando" which is however too lame and silly to consider it as a good film B with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> It's a movie The film of the 90s, but most importantly, the film should recall an action movie of the 80s, when this type of film B was at its highest level. These films have always been exaggerated and have never paid much attention to their story or acting. It was about exploding things, big muscle heroes and flying bullets. This film contains all these ingredients, but I did not really like watching this movie as much as I liked watching a similar type of movie. Hard to say why, because story and acting are just as bad as they would be in virtually any genre film of the same era. <br /> <br /> This is probably because the film is often far too stupid. All these types of movies have silly moments, but this film is full of them. The fighting, Dolph Lundgren, the characters, the story. All this is not very good because it is often too lame for words. Sometimes the story does not even try to make sense of something and what is even the main plot of the film in general? His story is widespread and seems to have been written only to create a movie with sequences of combat, armed fighting, etc. And these sequences are not even very good to really watch. The moments are far too short and disappointing to watch from the man who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> This is primarily a Dolph Lundgren, in which he plays the role of the great star of the hero, who strikes the buttocks with relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and, of course, also gets the girl, played by Tia Carrere. All of this also brings us one of the worst editing sequences in the action movie story and one of the worst sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Both are too weak for words and very poorly assembled. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really works. The good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like that. They simply kill without taking anybody's responsibility and they absolutely do not want to arrest or inform anyone of their findings. Even when they discover that a big Japanese crime syndicate is trying to seize the streets of Los Angeles, a beer brewery serves as a cover for a drug factory and a large-scale drug smuggling. And think about it for a moment. What is Brandon Lee's goal in the movie? The film could easily have been without him and the girl. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, lame and simplistic, but not entertaining enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
