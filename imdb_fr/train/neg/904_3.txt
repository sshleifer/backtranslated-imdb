She dances and dances in the living room of a worker. One night comes a medical trainee, Stephen Dallas, who is courting Stella and who, during their affair, permeates him. She rejects her two marriage and abortion deals, sends her into a lucrative medical career, and raises her daughter into almost absolute poverty herself.
