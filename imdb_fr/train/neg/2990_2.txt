Ohhh dude! That's what I'm talking about! As for the bad / cheesy horror movies, this movie was really a class apart. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was not originally in English. It's good because the voice dubbing was really exceptional! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialogue (and there is a lot more where it comes from) ?? "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty FOR YOUR BLOOD!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a recap game by game of interaction between the army and the scientists ?? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "You can not do that, it will be a disaster!" - Military officer: "This is only science fiction" (he then proceeds to a complete disaster, as the scientist had predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you do that, many people will die !!!" - Military officer: "you do not know what you're talking about." (He does it and many people die) <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Do not do that, it'll kill everyone!" - Military officer: "It's nonsense" (he then decides to kill everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you have the idea). <br /> <br /> If that was not enough ?? There were some scenes that stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the army literally has 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men. The leader shouts, "Go get them!" and all 10 members of the army, one at a time, drop their weapons and fight the two opponents with their fists! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. No attention to detail has been left! This movie even had an 80s keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the tone! <br /> <br /> And believe me ?? I realize that this review may contain spoilers, but there are so many good things in this epic that I only scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade! A real movie viewing experience! A masterpiece! Wow!
