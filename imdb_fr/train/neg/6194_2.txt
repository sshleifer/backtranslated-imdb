With a title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and liberal contributions from Kubrick, Haneke and Noah, it is painfully clear that Thomas Clay sees himself as a cut above the usual waste of our British cinema. "Robert Carmichael" (abbreviated) presents itself as a realistic study of the alienation of youth and at the same time a critique of the war in Iraq. The problem with realism is that the characters are so obviously unrealistic and atypical - unlike the fetid imagination of "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not drug-addicted rapists. As a critic of the war in Iraq, a film about youth violence (directed by a talented classical musician - the underlying society has harmed this sensitive individual) is so childish that it is hard to imagine of reflection. There are signs of technical ability, but some commentators have exaggerated it. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire to shock linked to an alleged serious intention can be the worst trap to the cinematic of the recent movie. People liked "mechanical orange" and "irreversible" because they liked the rapes and the violence, but they especially liked to feel culturally superior to love the things they hated the most. So too much of Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) qualifies it here as one of the most stupid movies of the years. (I'm not against violence in movies.) To do this seriously is a tricky trick: people in cinemas applauded Alex in "Clockwork Orange", showing that Kubrick's supposed intent had been missed for miles. Free violence is much easier to achieve and less offensive than the claims of many art film directors.)
