I am a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you need a well written script. Left Behind is lamentably behind on this. On the one hand, it departs radically from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel into a two-hour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense. <br /> <br /> Something else, the development of the characters is zero. When the characters in the story are saved (I will not say who), the book makes it clear that the process is long and intriguing. In the film, it's fast and artificial. The book is written quite decently where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the film, the scenarios are systematically processed quickly without anything substantial. In another scene where a character is angry at being left behind (again, I will not say who), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I realize as a Christian that it is not edifying to say that I do not like this film, but I can not, in good conscience, recommend a film that, at my opinion was horribly done. Perhaps it would have been better to make the first book in 2-3 films. Be that as it may, Christians need to understand that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by making a film in a qualitative way. I realize that a lot of effort has probably gone into Left Behind, but that's how I see it.
