"Proximity" refers to a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is ready to kill him. This very ordinary movie is an action / drama with a weak plot; stereotyped and undeveloped characters; and a one-dimensional performance of Lowe. A forgettable film that does not deserve to be commented further.
