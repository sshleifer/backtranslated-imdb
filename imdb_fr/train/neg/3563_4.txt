Most of the time, this film looks like an effort "made for television". The staging is hermetic, the acting game (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overworked and soapy. Denise Crosby, in particular, delivers her lines as if she were cold by reading them on a memory card. This film deserves to be looked at in one way: it is the return of Gage of "Semetary". Watching a little child murder someone is disturbing, and this film is perhaps more than some people can bear, just for that reason. It's absolutely scary. This film does only one thing, but it leaves the park. It's worth seeing only the last 10 minutes or so.
