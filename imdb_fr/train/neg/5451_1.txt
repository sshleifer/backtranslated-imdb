Filmfour will have to do a lot better than this little movie to get the good name for himself. <br /> <br /> This movie happens in Glasgow some minor characters have something approaching a Scottish accent). The premise, about people who are living going nowhere, who are all in the same cafe in the early morning when they have night jobs, COULD make a really funny, insightful, offbeat and cult movie. Instead, we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot that has been so complicated that I am surprised that it has not been banned. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh, you realize that. <br /> <br /> A total loss of time. Painful Dialogue - It looked like something a 16-year-old group would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - it was enough to write her as a symbolic woman in the hope that women would be encouraged to see him. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of thick boy who makes fun of beer pubs and can usually be found wandering in packages shouting out on Saturday nights in mundane downtowns, then you'll love this movie and find it "on the far right". All the others, run, do not stay away from this unfortunate little misfit. <br /> <br /> And a question, when the group left the "boring" city by the sea (Saltcoats although having changed the name of the film), to return to Glasgow, WHY have it they do via Forton highway services to LANCASTER that is in England?
