While the premise behind The House, where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. I do not even know where to start because I have so many problems with this movie. I guess I'll number a few: <br /> <br /> 1. The game ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and his teeth) are the stars of your movie, do you know that you have problems? Not that it matters to me, but it's not really A-List names. Susan George may have played in a few films that I enjoy, but I've never considered her as the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this film, his game is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less we say, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. The ghosts ?? The ghosts, the spirits or what you want to call, reminded me a little of the ghosts of the haunted mansion. Disney World. And, they are also scary. And why should they be so obvious? Subtlety is not a feature of The House Where Evil Dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable can a movie be? The result of this film is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters. If you can not know where this movie was directed after about 15 minutes, you should see more. <br /> <br /> 4. The Practical Priest ?? What are the chances that the haunted house you buy is right in front of a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention the fact that one of them knows the story of your home and comes, knock on the door and ask if you need help to eliminate evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think of positive things to write about. I guess I'll give him a point for the opening scene and a point for the architecture of the house. This is a sure sign of a winner? note that architecture is one of the highlights of any movie does not say much about the film. <br /> <br /> I will stop. You should be able to get an idea of ​​what I already mentioned. And, I did not even mention the boring little girl or the crab invasion or a host of other problems. Be warned, this thing is horrible.
