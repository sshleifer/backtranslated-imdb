Broadcasts of Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante on Broadway lasted for years, but the adaptation of this film, which probably stems from the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, lost all trace of his power and charisma) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director-choreographer like a gluttony corporate lawyer). The slender story, from an exhausting audition for a Broadway show that turns into a therapy session for actors, dancers and singers, is highlighted, with noisy and coppery talents that play to the end. Nothing is modulated or subtle, especially a derisive plot in which an ex-dancer returns to the theater and collides with Douglas. Over-enthusiastic hopes are full of promise and heartache, but their personal stories of anguish are a little embarrassing; this, coupled with Attenborough's slow pace, disasters, and even the now famous songs, fail to break through the artificial wrapping. * 1/2 of ****
