I grew up Baptist and I know the story that this movie tries to tell, even if I do not believe it anymore. I want to congratulate the film for being as good as the average film of the week. Slightly interesting, mediocre game, a little slow, the scenario is predictable, the music is serious and a bit melodramatic. And all those left behind must be the purest and cleanest non-Christians in the world. Not a single curse word of any of them. But I burst out laughing when the actor who plays the man who runs the United Nations called the word "nuclear" "nu-cu-ler", just like Bush. Is there a Christian code of honor that states that since Bush says he too is called by God, all Christians must conceal his ignorance by mispronouncing the word in the same way as he does? LOL! I really struggled to take the film seriously after all. After the incident "nu-cu-ler", the film began to look like a propaganda manipulated and manipulated. I was looking for something daring. In fact, I was looking for something that would make me think, but I did not find it here. If you are looking for a crazy entertainment, stop here, it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for information, look elsewhere.
