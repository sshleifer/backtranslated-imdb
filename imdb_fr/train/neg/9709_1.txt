30 seconds after the beginning of the credits, I had the feeling that it would be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. Then, the actor who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decide that to survive this film, we will have to lower the volume, establish our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But it did not help. About halfway through, we turned it off. Now, I've already had some really bad movies, with and without the help of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are just a few movies that I doubt even Bots can save. The most important part of the film that bothered me the most was that people hypnotized by believing they were zombies had rotting green skin. I guess they were all hypnotized in death, and then hypnotized into rotting themselves. Stick to the classics of the B series such as "Plan Nine From Outer Space".
