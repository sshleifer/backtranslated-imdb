It never ceases to amaze me to see how you can take an excellent actor and lose it in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but he could not even save that movie. In fact, his character is pretty much the same one he played in Cape Fear, which was pretty good, but I can not stand it when actors do the same thing with more than one movie. I think it's getting old, and that's the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this movie, but the story has already been told millions of times. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his characterization is evident in his characterization. De Niro plays the role of the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than amusing. <br /> <br /> However, since De Niro is IN this movie, it makes it a draw if you're a fan (no pun)) who sees everything he does, no matter how serious he is. But to see De Niro at its best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land", or even go back and take a look at "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". Do not waste your time with this fight. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
