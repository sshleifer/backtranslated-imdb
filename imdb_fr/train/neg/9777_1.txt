I was drawn to this film, curious to see how they adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich tapestry of characters, horrible situations and social criticism could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible cinematic experience, not for its content, but for its form. Director Ulrich Edel executes, in my opinion sincere, a terrible directorial work that does not do justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a television director; this film looks like a bad movie "made for television". Some of my views on this bomb (** coming spoilers **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of creative leadership. The scenes are slow, slow to feel, look awkward, and almost never come out of an anchored position. The only freedom they take is in the field of cinematography, with a pretty dark tone. Apart from that, the film has the same technical creativity as a television soap opera. <br /> <br /> - All actors do a great job in describing these miserable characters. The problem is that adaptation does not address a fundamental element of plot development: motivation. All these characters move like robots, without clear motivation for their action. They seem to do things unexpectedly, like robots, for no reason. Edel misses every opportunity to enrich the development of the character by not exploring the motivations of the character and avoiding to fully develop the personality of each character. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is obvious to Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight is doing a great job playing this trash prostitute, but her alcohol-related decision to let the sailors rape her is not explained. It seems extremely stupid, as we see this character doing it unexpectedly. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The movie also features many secondary characters, symbolic, that do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I would have liked to know more about Harry's wife, for example, and about the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel is only interested in the development of the character with Harry and his attachment to his gay lover, then spoil everything at the end, without clearly explaining his motivations. The thugs are also kidding in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I know. Terrible work of Mark Knopfler. I was seriously expecting more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his work in this film is seriously lacking. Sometimes, as in the battle between the unionists and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the film. He also feels completely poor and anachronistic; I could swear that the whole soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It diverts attention from the real action. <br /> <br /> - The adaptation to Desmond Nakano's book is so literal that it eliminates the meaning of history. One has the impression that they tried so much to keep the story in the book, action by action, that they forgot to develop the characters and, once again, to explain their actions and their motivations. <br /> <br /> I am serious. I can not recommend this movie, not even to a Shelby fan, because it can destroy the original book. It is a very superficial effort to adapt the novel and very little creativity.
