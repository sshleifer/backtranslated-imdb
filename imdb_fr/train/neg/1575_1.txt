This film is so bad that it hurts. The car rolls at 30 mph when it is supposed to go to 100 ... the locked gear lever (at Park!), The nurse who drives for nearly 2 hours with the cell phone in the shoulder. .. none of the 2 fools take this damn phone? There is nothing credible in this shit. I would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this!
