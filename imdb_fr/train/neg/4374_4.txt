<br /> <br /> The intrigues of a Virgo are so bizarre and incomprehensible that they allow the viewer to interpret them subjectively, applying the meaning he wishes to his inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If it was an intentional feature of the film, it would be post-modern engineering work, but that is of course not the case. <br /> <br /> Without going too much into the plot summary, let's make a short walking tour of the events. In an isolated cabin, an orgy is underway, which includes barefoot wrestling and diaper laying. A group of latecomers joined the current orgy, but they were involuntarily followed by a monster that I like to call "the muddy ninja". This monster precedes to kill participants in an orgy one by one, except the proverbial virgin (if you do not count oral sex) who receives her semen and therefore becomes so passionate of desire that she masturbates with the hand cut off. someone. <br /> <br /> Finally, she has the guts removed, then a scene seems to indicate that she is pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. Do you have all this? If you rent this movie, it's better not to speak Japanese or subtitles. In a season populated by boring Hollywood movies, putting it in your VCR could be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. It will certainly be something different.
