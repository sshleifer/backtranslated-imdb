"American Nightmare" is officially linked, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" for the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (who look suspiciously like the K-Mart version of the "Friends" cast) gather at a caf√© to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It is hosted by a guy with a beard. This is the most exciting aspect of his show. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey and ... oh, wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie and the rest of the gang of delinquents to one liner taking turns revealing their biggest fears at Bearded DJ. Unknowingly, a mad serial nurse is listening ... <br /> <br /> A crazy nurse is torturing Ross and Rachel and ... waits again, sorry ... by exacerbating their fears. These fears include stunners such as "voodoo" and the fact that old ladies wearing dentures are fading. <br /> <br /> No Really. <br /> <br /> In a word, this film was rotten. Crazy Nurse's deadly madness lacks motivation, nothing makes the spectator "jump", the end hits him and, again, voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you do not care about your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you love your loved ones, even a little bit - go to your local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in the freezer.
