For my first experience of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what these people have done for a perfectly successful play. <br /> <br /> - Let's start on the right side, are we going? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogues could have been delivered with more feeling. The rest of the actors had to gather it. <br /> <br /> Romeo, Romeo, why are not you still dead, Romeo? The actor, although not only completely wooden and impassive, could absolutely not read his lines with enthusiasm. He was completely vague, had trouble looking at Juliet in the face, and absolutely NOT thanks to the features that had been given to him. Whoever throws it deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost practicable, but she does not give depth to her character and seems to be completely disconnected from the room. Mercutio was incredibly scary and completely devoid of character for the entirety of her dialogue. Benvolio was insensitive and ruthless with his lines. <br /> <br /> I had to support this half-cooked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was scalded and the costumes were simply disturbing. I saw kindergarten puppet shows with more effort. I only wish that I could give this film a score of zero.
