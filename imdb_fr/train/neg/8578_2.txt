One of the craziest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable haunted comedy with music performed by Kay Kyser. Kyer, conductor and star of the radio (and the eternal fraternity of the blundering colleges), was in a way the precursor of Spike Jones. He was hired to organize a birthday party in a dark mansion, the kind where poisoned darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. The shindig is assaulted by a terrifying judge, a scary teacher, a disturbing swami, many gigantic females and enough bad jokes to fill three images of Bob Hope. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) have nothing to boast about, any more than Kyser is too confident, it's with a material sewn into the ribs that dates back to the year 1940. * de *** *
