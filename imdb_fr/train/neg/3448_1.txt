I watched this movie when it still had 6 voices and it said like 7.2 or something, but seriously it's a horrible movie. Break it down. The first thing you notice about this film is that it was filmed on a portable digital camera held by a freshman at a community college. the next thing you'll notice is that the actors, are all the friends of this first year (he probably met them at the pub the night before.) Third on the list, you'll notice that the music editing is horrible, and they're trying to to clutter a lot of the songs in this movie, 30 seconds apart ... all digital editing is also done on the personal computer of this freshman ... probably Windows Movie Maker.This film was horrible. .. pretentious, his scenario was undeniably bad and I would not recommend this film to anyone I know, but I condemn the author and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.
