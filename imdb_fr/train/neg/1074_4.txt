I should never have started this movie and stopped watching after 3/4. I missed the really sloppy end. This film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. There was a good atmosphere, a cast and a leading director, good locations. But a baaaaaad story, a bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent - it was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting unreal and improbable. No one behaves like that outside of Hollywood scripts.
