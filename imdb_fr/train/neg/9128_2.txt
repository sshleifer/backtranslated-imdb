Even though we did not realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and that he had died before the film was released, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be painful to watch. It is supposedly a sieve of Sax Rohmer's famous oriental villain, but he lacks concentration. The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental accents of the Rohmer concept is ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist insults. There are hardly any jokes or gags, but most actors behave stupidly and throw sad sentences. It is particularly distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to swear and launch racial slurs for trying to laugh. Most other actors are embarrassed too. <br /> <br /> And then Peter Sellers. He plays the dual role of the sinister Fu Manchu, who tries to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his British opponent, Nayland Smith. Sellers are not a hundred percent bad; He expresses a strange warmth in Smith's role when he talks about his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he is strangely moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for the entertainment of the English music hall. But most of the time, he plays both roles with a weary sadness, sabotaging any comic possibility. The seller's routines where he revitalizes his decreasing force by electric shocks are particularly painful; he seems too distressed to be funny. <br /> <br /> A few truly spiritual lines, a slapstick perfectly adapted from Burt Kwouk (Cato in PINK PANTHER films) as one of Manchu's henchmen, and Helen Mirren's fun musical numbers can not not to save this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedy genius, he will not learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
