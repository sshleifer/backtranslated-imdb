When Stanwyck's future husband is murdered on the eve of their wedding, she retreats to a mountain hut, where she slips (somehow) on a cliff and is rescued by wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a decidedly one-sided wedding, spent on a huge estate in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted by Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan, in a very moderate and unconvincing scenario resolution. <br /> <br /> This film has an excellent cast (Morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is sinuous and sometimes seems useless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie but I was finally disappointed. It's always worth watching for the cast, and it's good for those who love 1930's movies.
