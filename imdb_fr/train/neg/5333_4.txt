A burlesque slapstick mess posing as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull champion who is leaving the rodeo for a home stay in his parents' desert in Arizona, where government lawsuits have just invested in the family flock (who badly needs a stud) . What the director Peter Tewksbury badly needs is storytelling, although he lacks a bit of evaluation, but he is catching up in sloppy comic montages. are fun scenes). In spite of the colorful turns of Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general loafing becomes uncontrollable, and there is too much hoop and hollerin to support a keen interest. As for Elvis, he is always keen and fearful - and while it's nice to see him having fun on the screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on cinema. This chaos in an image has a feeling of what hell itself, and although the spirits are high, the returns are usually low. * 1/2 of ****
