I was going to say it was the worst gay-themed movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say it's the worst movie, no matter what genre I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know, you 'When a film begins with a "personal message" from the director, it asks readers to "understand" the "many challenges" faced by a new director. The audio track is so bad in many scenes that it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and that from a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad scenery, bad photography, a mediocre scenario, a generally bad action game, everything contributes to make this "film" unassailable. After several attempts, I went to the wrong end, and I immediately sold the DVD I stupidly bought. I am sure that the first director is facing many challenges. But do not try to turn this lame attempt into a finished product. From the details of IMDb, I see that it was not only Richard Natale's first attempt at realization, but also the only one. This is the only positive thing I can say about this so-called "film".
