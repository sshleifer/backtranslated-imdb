This is another bad movie you should probably avoid looking at. The plot could be much more "thick" than it actually is and would be better conceived as a blockbuster movie. <br /> <br /> The action leaves something to be desired, although you can not quite put your finger on what it is. <br /> <br /> This is one of those you are watching late in the evening, maybe in the US, just because you can not fall asleep. Look at her if you want, but do not expect too much of her.
