It's one of the hilarious movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. <br /> <br /> I watched this DVD movie with a group of friends on a Friday night and we could not stop laughing from beginning to end. Finish. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: terrorists hijack a convoy carrying military-grade uranium, but it actually carries a group of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy mistake to make. Invite a surprisingly incompetent team of special forces from the army to attack prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the role of "Smell the fart", as advocated by Joey in Friends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of gore and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately, the Rance team seems to have a hard time aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant and heavy monsters. Plus, the lights always seem to flicker and go out every time a Velociraptor attacks (so we can not see how bad the creature's effects are). <br /> <br /> That said, we all had a lot to do. of pleasure by betting on who was going to be bitten thereafter. <br /> <br /> As a thrilling venture in the style of Jusassic Park / Aliens, this film stinks more than the crotch of a dinosaur, but it is ridiculous. the entertainment is a brilliant success.
