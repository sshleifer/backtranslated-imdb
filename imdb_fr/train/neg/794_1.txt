Unless you already know the pop stars that play in this movie, save time and stop reading this review after reaching the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> YOU FORGET FALL OF TORT FILM AND GO WATCH SOMETHING OTHERWISE. <br /> <br /> But if you want to read, consider: <br /> <br /> A burning vehicle for pretty idols of Japanese teenagers with a convoluted "plot" dropping in unbearable time, until you're ready to scream. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film makes sense. It is an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, WITHOUT REASON. We can obviously find that something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we are not giving a hogwash WHY because there is no background. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you'll be tired of those stupid, lean and girly faces. You will be outraged at having spent all this time watching them smile, sneer, cry, look mysterious, be "serious" and any other useless expressions that they slap on their faces. <br /> <br /> Even going so far as to say that this insipid junk is "the soul" of any of its "actors" should prove to you without a shadow of a doubt what the band- Announcement and innumerable adoring comments from this site will not tell you: <br /> <br /> Only "converted" henchmen will love this film, mostly teenagers with pathological adoration for all that is androgynous. Freud would have a day on the ground. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of those thoughtless "fans", get away from this abomination.
