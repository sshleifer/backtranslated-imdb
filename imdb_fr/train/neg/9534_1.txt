I'm a fan of the previous Best of the Best movies. But this one was awful. No wonder I had so much trouble finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores, until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was dreadful, the plot was a joke and the action was also bad. <br /> <br /> Alex Grady, Travis Brigley, and the original characters of kickboxing and the theme that this movie had with the first one really miss. 2 films. <br /> <br /> John
