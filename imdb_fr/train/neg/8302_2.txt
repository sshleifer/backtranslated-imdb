It's funny how a studio thinks it can follow what was a classic Christmas story with a whole new cast and expect it to float. Of course, they used different actors for Batman, but in this case, Batman was a classic character before the actor went into cape. In this case, you had a classic character in the blond-headed horn glasses wearing Ralphy sunglasses who wanted a red-barreled rifle for Christmas ... We are supposed to forget about it and accept another little boy who looks nothing like the original. If I had not known it was a sequel, I would not have guessed it ... except that, of course, Charles Grodin is trying to emulate Darrin McGavin so that he is constantly reminded of the original that the original was far better ... <br /> In the end, it could work if they had filmed the film better. They should have looked for what they like or simply ignore the original and not try to copy their appearance. This one is just a cheap imitation. Ralphy has no sympathy, just the desire to give the impression that his character is shooting at his eye or dying.
