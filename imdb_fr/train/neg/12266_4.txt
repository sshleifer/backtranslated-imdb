The images of Republic appear late in the genre "werewolf" and the genus Werecat. The plot has a writer back in Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed a fear of the jungle during which he had power cuts. He arrives with great success, because his novel, which is the result of an infamous lawsuit, is a bestseller. The French government wants to know if it had access to secret documents, which seems more likely when an official is killed by a "man of the cat". Suspicions really weigh on the writer when his fianc√© is found dead. The return of power outages is complicated, so the writer does not know if he is the killer or not. <br /> <br /> The thriller is much too quiet to be fully appreciated. There are too many music numbers at the beginning and too much time out when everything happens in the central and following sections. The acting is good and the sets pretty good, but there is a reason why most people I know remember only the killer in the head, this is the most interesting thing about this movie. despite its short duration (a little over an hour), I think the reason this movie has rarely been seen on television is that after 20 minutes you start losing patience. As good as the speech was, I just wanted someone to do something. When that finally happened, in the last minutes, it was too little and too late. <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
