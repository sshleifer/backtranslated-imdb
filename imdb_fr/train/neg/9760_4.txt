As the film crew does not have good access to the occupied territories, the filming of the Israeli part is therefore dominated. I was struck by the almost completely opposite views of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the opportunity to lead an extremely happy life. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of deprivation and despair. With completely different points of view, no meeting had any real chance to meet. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for all of them. Peace to the Palestinians was freedom. Peace to the Israelis was security. With such a chasm, is this kind of movie really worth a lot? I ended up feeling like I was watching a useless propaganda - both sides were not convincing.
