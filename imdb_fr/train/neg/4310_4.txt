This film tells the story of a very sexy Olympic track star who is hired to coach the high school boys basketball team. Similar to WILDCATS by Goldie Hawn, she plays Cathy Lee Crosby in the lead role and she does it as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but given the movie's apparent budget for television, they probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great in every shot, but we never see her completely naked. The story is predictable enough, to say the least, without surprises. Michael Biehn, young and lucky, has the male lead role. He is the star of the team and the love affair of Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some fun scenes as a rich old man who runs the sports program and does not think a woman should coach sports. This point is addressed throughout the film and, needless to say, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee did not submit her team to unorthodox workouts; she does not do anything that a male coach would not do. There is a fun side plot involving a tall, not very bright player who is hypnotized to succeed in class and play as professional basketball player Sydney Wicks. Looks like everyone has had a good time making this movie, but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not a great actress, but she has a bright smile, beautiful hair and a very tanned body.
