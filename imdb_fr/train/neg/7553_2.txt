A phenomenal achievement in horrors. It's really hilarious. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Nicholas Cage must now qualify for the final in the Over-Emotion category of his acting class. Wearing new hairstyles and whose face has been so often raised, his ears pinned to the back seem to have trouble touching himself in the back, he oozes not only ill smarmies, but creates a character of "hero" that does not interest you not. <br /> <br /> I do not know what it is with Neil Labute and the female characters. He makes sure that the women are totally deviant and evil ... and reimburses them by asking Cage to hit several directly in the face and call them all "b **** es" several times. I enjoyed LaBute's early films and some of his plays ... but it's a strange fascination. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a 2 out of 10 based solely on Ellen Burstyn's performance. By the time she finally makes her appearance (pointing bravely in her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead), it seems that all hope is lost. She deserves an Oscar, here and now, for expressing her features with an impassive face. When she appears, she wears a white mumu and a blue, white, and gold-colored facial paint on The Wicker Man. You know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin has really prepared this role is going well. <br /> <br /> This movie is so crazy that you have to believe it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Highlights include: Nicholas Cage fleeing a swarm of bees and then falling on a hill. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bicycle and looks like Mrs. Gulch of the Wizard of Oz who rides her. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage walks the island beats doors in search of the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING after a career as a promising actress in a "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dancing around said in mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage screaming, "Who burned him, who burned him, who burned him, who burned him, who burned him, who burned him?" without reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods, taking off the costume (but leaving the bear's feet), then doing some karate moves towards some bad guys. <br /> <br /> And you did not live until you saw the last 15 minutes of the film and its awful epilogue that looked like the one that was shot yesterday in your cousin's basement . <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can get through this film without laughing out loud, you deserve a medal. There was a moment in the movie where I stopped laughing and wondered if it was maybe not a long series of films about "hysteria" ... only to remind me when Cage would scream / shouted / murmured his dialogue that he was really taking himself very seriously. <br /> <br /> I think this one is destined to become a cult movie again ... just because it's awful.
