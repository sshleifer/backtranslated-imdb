This series had potential, but I guess the budget would not allow him to see it. An interesting montage, quite close to "lost" it falls flat after the 1st episode. The entire series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90-minute film, but the producers chose to drag it over and over again. Many scenes were incredibly slow and slow without taking action. The music was very annoying and did not work on the whole. There were few characters that were important to us because their characters did not grow during the period - well, one grew a bit. The end was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only bravo here is the art department and the decorators, they created an interesting look, a pity that the writer and the director do not have the foresight to do something interesting with this element.
