This film runs in circles and the viewer does not know where they are. At first, I thought ... mmmmm, it could be a pretty cool movie, but it hangs around again and again and you do not know what's going on. The leading woman is a good actress and has played her role well, and the psychopath type is scary, but after a while, we do not care what happens, because this film is just spinning. It's a shame, it could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Let's say that the main woman and the psycho fella will have a good career in front of them, but will they remember this film, for having made them known, or to be the film that they regret? have never done.
