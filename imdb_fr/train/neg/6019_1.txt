This film is one of the reasons why IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10. The acting is awful, even what some have praised, the character of Carpathia! The script seems to have been written in a hurry. In one scene, the black preacher who had been left in the place, when Buck asked him what "dan7" meant in computer graphics, said, "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers missed that mistake. The worst is perhaps that the eschatological position of the film is biblically dubious. While many Christians have embraced the film's interpretation of end-time events, such an interpretation, in my opinion, is at fault. To understand these shortcomings, read Jim McKeever's "Christians Go Through the Tribulation" and "The Blessed Hope, A Bible Study of the Second Advent and Rapture" by George E. Ladd.
