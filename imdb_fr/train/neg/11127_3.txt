I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking about when she made this film, but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel, on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> We read the novel from this past summer for AP English 12, and just watched the movie. During the periodic note-taking and checking of the clock, I considered the chances of being struck by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear and I had to watch the rest of the movie ... then write a 5-paragraph essay. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel dealt with very real themes, namely the spirit of a killer and the psychology behind it. Silver's film turned a murderer into a victim, which was NOT what Wright wanted (see: "How was born the greatest" 454). <br /> <br /> I'll do this short and nice: if you want Let your conscience, in the words of Raphael Lambert, spotless, skip the film and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not a subject that encourages reflection. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: I must now write the essay.
