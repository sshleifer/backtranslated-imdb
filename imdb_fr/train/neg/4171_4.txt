I'd been running this title 15 or 20 times as a Blockbuster, looking for something decent to watch. All I can say is that they were all out of half decent movies the night I chose to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> easy enough to say since this one did NOT have Caper Van Dien in it. It lacked something else: an interesting cast, an interesting story, a good dialogue and originality, but I guess you can not have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The unsuitable crew of vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ... go figure out) flew from mining colony to mining colony trying to eliminate all the vampires he could find. The crew consists of: the arrogant and daring captain (who dies prematurely), his second, yet inexperienced, to the book, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typo), a cowboy and an Asian commando REALLY REALLY, a "beefy" woman ... it's almost like casting for "The Real World" from MTV. After the death of the captain in a violent confrontation with a crush of leech (and it turns out that lovers of the finest parts of the human anatomy), his first companion takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates it .. blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but as I said, it's the same scenario as the one used in a hundred or so 'movies' of the genre. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Dacier was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was pretty hot, but of course, if you wait for her to expose more than her cleavage, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say that this was the worst film I saw, when I rented "Starship Troopers 2", but wait for it to air on the channel Sci-Fi.
