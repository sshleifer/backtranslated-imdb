I received this DVD from a friend who received it from someone else (and it probably continues ...) Even the DVD sleeve looks cheap, as does the entire movie. Gunshots and fights with delayed sound effects, among the worst actors I've seen in my life, a simple plot, it made me laugh until I got a stomach ache! With very few financial resources, I must admit that it looked very professional. Seen like a movie, it was one of 13 movies about a dozen gangster movies that no one was waiting for. So: if you are tired and want to laugh cheap, watch this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
