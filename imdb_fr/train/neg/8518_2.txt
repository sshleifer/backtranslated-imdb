I am amazed at the number of comments on this show about its "reality". Maybe I'm not part of the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is one thing, it's too big. <br /> <br /> The actors play enthusiastically tells the landscape and the pitches are pierced by a truck through. This is not what I call real. <br /> <br /> He is so eager to want to be "relevant" that it only shows how much Rob Thomas and his team are cut off from reality. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found it was at best a sleep party and at worst a little more annoying. Kristen Bell seems to be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the extravagant style of the entire series.
