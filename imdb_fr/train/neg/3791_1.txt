I can not vote because I will not look at the garbage of these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would not happen again. I have a civic duty to help people stay away from this waste. Go to the forums of this movie and read where the cast members are trying to act as if they were seeing the movie for the first time. A guy even answers to himself ... using the same name! There are some phrases in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... not even close (by any means). If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first. This means that the 3rd movie should be a lot better. Not so, I saw it. All I want to know is how you distribute this recycle bin using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie on weekends is good ... but do not try to sell this garbage!
