I usually like humor movies. I really appreciate them. But I do not really understand the point "Envy". I mean, he has a monotonous content / subject, and it's not really funny. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is generally good, it is not enough that the film becomes a bit interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this film. <br /> <br /> So, if you're about to rent a comedy, I suggest you do not go there. Unless you want to get bored, and I see that I'm not the only one to express this opinion, because even Jack Black has apologized (take a look at Trivia).
