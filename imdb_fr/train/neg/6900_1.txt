I sat in the theater, bored, I wanted to leave in the middle of the film. The plot is simple 4 Samoans wrecks marriages. They must therefore bring dates to be able to get married. Yawning. <br /> <br /> What annoyed me most was the so-called cruel jokes ... They were very unpleasant, clich√©s and thrown in the face to get you into the already dull film. The cast of actors was below average and I felt that this film was spinning around nothing, if it was a bunch of jokes without history and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worst movies I've seen from 2006, not funny, bad acting, just lousy. <br /> <br /> Well, thank god, a friend shouted at me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
