This film is rather nil. I am in the army and the soldiers represented in this film are horrible. If you are in the military and you see this film, you will laugh and upset the whole movie because of the way they acted as a team. It was ridiculous. They acted like a group of normal people wearing army uniforms, not knowing what to do. It was a bloody movie, it's the least I can say. There have been some scenes where they try to blow you up. I would recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent and bloody movie. It will be a better film too if you are not in the army. I must also say that I liked the first better than this one.
