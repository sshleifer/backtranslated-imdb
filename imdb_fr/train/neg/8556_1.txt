OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I am in the age group and I identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes sticky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic and, in a different film, it would have been forgivable. <br /> <br /> I try as hard as possible not to trim this film like the others, but it's not so easy when the filmmakers did not try at all. <br /> <br /> The editing in this film is terrible! Perhaps the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you do not need to go to film school to learn, learning a good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is. <br /> <br /> And also, the shot ... Oh my God the shots, just horrible! I can not even go into the details, but sometimes we just see random things appear, and this, in conjunction with the editing, will give you the most painful movie viewing experience. <br /> <br /> This film is made on low or no budget with 4 actors and the team is not an excuse too. I saw short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what the heck you were thinking about, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of your two egos. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this movie is like a really lazy amateur porn movie if it were filled with 3 or 4 ugly sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If this is not your type of thing, avoid it at all costs!
