This tedious and arduous film from the Las Vegas casino is almost impossible to watch and get involved. It's something you "look at" if you have absolutely nothing better to do. The only two decent things in this movie are linked to the beautiful Stella Stevens and one of them spends the entire program hoping she will fall off one of those lean tops she is wearing. A lot of great pictures of Las Vegas in the mid 70s (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashions of the day are good too. Otherwise, a big yawn. The Rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer, but even at less than $ 10, it's still not worth it in my humble opinion.
