After seeing the first ten episodes, I must say that this show is nil. <br /> <br /> What bothers me the most is that the series was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have been shooting in California so they could have scenes in the desert. It would have been more true for the film. The first scene where they are in another world is in the mountains, with many fir trees where it is cold. It does not seem very Egyptian. What worked so well in the film is that you feel like in ancient Egypt. Here, we have the impression that they fight against extraterrestrials in a Canadian forest. And it's so bad that on other planets, the appearance falls too. You can see leaves on the ground in forests that all look like forests outside of Vancouver. This makes the series even more incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> And then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russel. Of course, he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels' performances a bit, but he's just not as cool as Russel. And not as good actor as Russel. And the way Russells plays O Neill, well, he was a lot more cynical. Andersons O Neil, it's way too soft. I liked that the version of Russels does not give a s *** and had no trouble exploding the bomb until the very end of the film. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a pretty good job as Jackson, but replaces James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really boring character. It's Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! An old bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, seen only in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c speaks, speaks and acts like a robot. I saw better play Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and Ra's character and the people they saved in the film can speak English all at once is also amazing. stupid. What makes aliens so scary in the movie is that they speak an ancient language and are real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good in the driver. But the effects very rare in the current show are poorly made and seem cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious that they are walking on a sound stage with a poorly made painting in the background. It's an insult to viewers to have made the film look so cheap. Especially when they could have done it in front of a blue screen with CG funds. <br /> <br /> The X files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. It was 4 years before the start of SG-1. And they did not have the apparent budget of $ 2 million per episode, which SG-1 would supposedly have. They must have spent all the money on restoration. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> An unbelievably boring and useless show, which could have been great if they had shot the series in Hollywood with a larger budget, better writers and better characters.
