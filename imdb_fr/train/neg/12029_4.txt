In general, I found that if you do not hear about a movie before you see it on DVD, there is probably a good reason for it. I had never heard of this movie until I was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I'd give it a shot. <br /> <br /> This is really not much different from other movies like The Singles Ward or RM If you like these types of movies, you'll probably enjoy it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not Mormon, this movie will probably not interest you. There is no way to avoid the overtly religious message (mormon) contained inside of it, and it sometimes seems sassy and corny. In the end, if you are not part of the Mormon population, you would probably do better to look at something else. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were some very entertaining moments in the film, but I did not think it was enough to save the film as a whole.
