I just watched this DVD at home. We love westerns, so my husband praised it. He began to apologize to me halfway through. Saddles, costumes, accents - everything was off. The part that made me so crazy is the place where the guy did not shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrows while he took the soul of the big one. His only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows left". We watched the film from start to finish and, as someone said, there are too many bad things to see one of the reasons it hurt. I mean, the fact that the boy caught the devilish stone of the collector the same month and the same day it was found, what's the point? And why was there a grave where everyone died on April 25 when the people whose soul was taken by the collector were still standing? If you want to make fun of a movie after a few beers, it may be your movie. However, if you want a real western, you'll hate this movie.
