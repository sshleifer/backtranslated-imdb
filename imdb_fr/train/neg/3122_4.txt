I could not give a bad rating or bad review to this film for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are some disturbing elements that go to the psychological, on which the film could have focused a little. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a night DJ telling stories of personal problems: his sweetheart moves out and Gabriel has what appears to be a storyteller's blockage. One day, he receives and reads a story written by Pete Boland (Rory Culkin), a dying 14-year-old boy. Pete tells the story of his life and the mistreatment he suffered from his parents. He lives with his adoptive mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland does not even exist. I will not go into detail because I do not want to ruin the film, but I'll tell you this: it's quite predictable. A fascinating atmosphere to tell a story and good performances of Robin Williams and Toni Collette, whom I thought was the key character of the film. Collette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. Her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she embodies is very strange and I hope to see her win an Oscar (damn it, I think she could get a sign of the best actress in a supporting role if the scenario was a bit better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but predictable by the way. If you're curious about the end and twists of the movie, then watch the movie or I'll rent another predictable thriller called Hide and Seek.
