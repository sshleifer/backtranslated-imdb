Watching Tom Hanks as a hit for the Irish crowd is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist, it simply does not work. I had a lot of difficulty accepting that. Not that I do not think Tom can act, but I can follow his career since Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason, it fell flat for me. Maybe because I'm a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of looking like a fanboy (the only form of life inferior to a fanboy is a cockroach), the film as a whole fails for me.The Jude Law additions, and all the other subtractions left me cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took the whole heart of the story and left us with nothing but bare bones. There are things to love in this movie but the cinematography is breathtaking, filling the screen with beautiful images. Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really enjoyed the score. But Tom as "the angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat.
