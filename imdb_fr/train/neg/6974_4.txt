The blue monkey is actually mentioned in the movie, but no sense makes sense. At some point, some children wander through the deepest levels, exploring. <br /> <br /> They start talking about what they're going to find there and one of them (a girl) says she'll bet they'll find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's all. . Totally inconsequential in the story, the only sad connection with the title, and no idea of ​​why she would assume she finds a blue monkey in the basement of a hospital. <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to remember, but someone had to remember I guess!
