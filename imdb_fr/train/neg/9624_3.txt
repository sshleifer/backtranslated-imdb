Given the potential of this move, the reality was disappointing. Although it is always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that could not reverse the situation. Most of the actions were predictable. The jokes were flat to slightly amusing. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to love this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There is something about Mary". Here, it looks like he's just moving. If they have to raise plot points to "Friends", they should have known that something was wrong. The humor of the toilet should have stayed in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Look at "first 50 dates" instead.
