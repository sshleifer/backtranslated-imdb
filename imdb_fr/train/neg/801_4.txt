Despite his stereotypes, his almost illegible casting and his seemingly low budget, I thought this film was fine; much better than I expected. I was skeptical at first - the idea of ​​a computer virus that could also infect people seemed a bit ridiculous. But in the end, I thought that the film treated the concept well (even if some scenes were a little cliché). <br /> <br /> The distribution was pretty good and the two main actors seemed to take their roles very seriously. I could not help thinking that Janine Turner looked a little like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face or the makeup, the hair and the clothes she had in this movie, but it kept bothering me all the time. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a "must see" "Fatal Error" is an entertaining film that will allow you to watch until the end.
