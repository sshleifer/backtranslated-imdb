The Twilight Zone has achieved some mythology about it - a bit like Star Trek. This is because there are many lovers of the show who think that each episode has been a winner. They are the ones who assign a score of 10 to each individual and can not objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, some time ago, I reviewed all the original episodes of Star Trek (the good and the bad) because the ratings and reviews were overall too positive. Now it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> While I scored many episodes 10, this one gets a 3 just because it was bad. The writing was actually embarrassing. Two people from opposing parties in a great war are walking throughout this episode. After a while, it is obvious that they are the only two people left on Earth - as you will see in the really stupid and unconvincing conclusion. Usually, the twist at the end makes the episode awesome - this one killed it!
