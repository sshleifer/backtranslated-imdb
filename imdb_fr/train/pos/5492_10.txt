I was impressed by Chavez's position against globalization for some time now, but it was only when I saw the film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival that I realized what he had really accomplished. This film tells the story of the coup / conspiracy perpetrated by the Venezuelan elite, the oil companies and the corrupt, oil-ridden Western governments to dismiss the democratically elected president, Chavez, and bring Venezuela back under a dictatorship. brutal. This film is a must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I congratulate the Venezuelan people for taking things in their own hands and for saving their country from the likes of Halliburton and the Bush regime.
