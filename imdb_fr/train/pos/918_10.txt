If anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of this film, please read the bottom of this description: First broadcast by CBS on November 30, 2003, John Find, broadcast for television, is the sequel to the previous year of The City without Christmas, with Peter Falk resuming his role as versatile guardian angel Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a small town divorced nurse whose depression ... because the hospital emergency room she maintains may be forced to close due to a $ 100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper photo taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The photo shows an act of bravery accomplished by Noah's firefighter brother, Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left the city 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank would like to return quietly to town without explanation or fanfare, but this is not possible when Noah's newspaper publishes a $ 50,000 reward for identifying Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there is something very very curious about this picture: it also shows a Santa Claus costume apparently floating in the air without occupant. This elusive "Santa" is of course the angelic Max, who appears from time to time in the story in different forms to solve problems, give advice, link elements of the plot - and even share a musical duet with Kathleen's talented daughter. Socorro (Jennifer Pisana). <br /> <br /> INTERESTED IN HAVING A COPY: WRITE HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
