My catch: a clumsy but imaginative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (yes, Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter are the two punk-rock idiots from the sequel to the BILL AND TED adventure comedy, now a cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted have much more to do than travel back in time. They might as well travel to heaven and hell too! At the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "Battle of the Bands" contest that could make them more famous than ever. For many years in a futuristic civilization, the magician of the first film (the ever-viewable George Carlin) runs a university touting the names of Bill and Ted. There, a diabolical tyrant (Joss Ackland, of THE HUNT FOR RED of October) plots to get rid of the two idiot rock stars once and for all. So he sends two identical android replicas (to borrow the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> Then Bill and Ted suffer death and have to find their way through hell, with The inhabitants understand the worst memories of the duo, then go through Heaven to try to return to earth to save their lives friends ... and their show. Throughout this frantic journey, they play board games with Death (William Sadler, of DIE HARD 2), reminiscent of a similar moment in the 1957 foreign movie classic THE SEVENTH SEAL, an aid provided by two intelligent extraterrestrial beings and more. <br /> <br /> The array of BOGUS JOURNEY's exuberant special effect gimmicks is not up to current standards, and even the humor and for-the-time look are rather dated (Let's be honest , the film also has the impression of being released the bad year, even for the 90s). But with no less of a lack of imagination and a lively twist in both performance and direction, BOGUS JOURNEY by BILL AND TED is fun, imaginative, and yes, phony. <br /> <br /> Note: *** 1/2 of 5.
