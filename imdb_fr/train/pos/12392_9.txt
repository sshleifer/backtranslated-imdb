"The second beginning", as its title indicates, indicates the beginning of the end for the human race. Long before the matrix exists, this short film written by the Wachowski shows us the world that could predict us in the not-too-distant future, defined at the turn of the twenty-first century. The second renaissance looks at issues common to human behavior. ; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common in science fiction and fantasy narratives. The second renaissance is no exception to this concept. However, instead of a simple man / machine arrangement, this story explains the struggle that machines endure, the struggle for acceptance in a world governed by humans. Where matrix films show us the human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second part of the Renaissance 1 + 2 answers many questions raised by the original movie Matrix, such as the war broke out, the sky is black, which led to the use of the humans as batteries and also introduces us machine machine called 01, which could affect the next film Matrix Revolutions. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the story too much, because I do not want to spoil the audience experience, but I will recommend it to anyone interested in the world of the matrix or just to anyone interested to Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
