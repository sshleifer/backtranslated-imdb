"Life strikes us in the face ... we must try to stay beautiful" <br /> <br /> First film of one of the best Belgian artists (he sings songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited film and happy joyous joy for Flemish cinema, really interesting to watch and a promising job! It takes us into the lives of 8 main characters who live on a Friday and a night. The title says a lot about how we spend time with them: we float as they do on the evening of Friday night when they meet. <br /> <br /> It's a very thoughtful rhythmic style. Superb use of music. It sometimes takes over for the images and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 minutes ???) is a thrilling visual experience because of the way it was shot. It really keeps you going while you are in a small place with a lot of people having a big party ..... so hard to turn. <br /> <br /> Thank you menij√®r Barman for making this daring film Flemish cinema has been a difficult time for several years now. You made my day!
