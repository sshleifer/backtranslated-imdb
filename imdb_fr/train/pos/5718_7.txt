I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets, then checked the reviews on IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which were obviously meant to scare, were actually quite humorous, almost like Buffy's against vampires. <br /> <br /> I do not consider this a bad movie. It's not a good movie either. Just a horror movie rather well done. It does not rely much on special effects, but on camera angles, the acting, the music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were not bad either, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are nice (and I do not care that the sets are exactly the same as those used in the Japanese original). <br /> Frightening moments were often predictable. But not always. I saw a lot of horror and I did not expect to be afraid now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The film had some beautiful, almost original scenes, like streaks of garbage, simple special effects for ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat making strange noises, the dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go there if you want to see Sarah in another episode of Buffy, because her work is very different from Buffy's, much more serious. Do not go there if you only want to see Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave him a 7.
