I saw it on a Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the sub-characters were overly acting. It hurt the film, as did the rather lame musical score, which irritated me throughout the film. If the score was improved, I could forget the few scenes too long. So the movie would be a lot, a lot better.
