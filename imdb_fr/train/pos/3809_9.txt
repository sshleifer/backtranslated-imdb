Have you heard the story of reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to kill a dragon? Oh, have you? Was it located in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above the clouds, and did the heroes have to make dangerous jumps from one island to another during their journey? Has the water flowed upwards and are the remains of big cities levitated on the horizon? I did not mean it. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this film and I'm really happy to have done it! This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Like Pixar movies, this is a computer-animated artwork that could only be possible in today's world. The presenters have reflected on almost everything on the screen, and this attention to detail is staggering (the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground burst into green smoke as characters walk unconsciously in the background is the 'one of my favorites). The monsters are also fully realized and wonderful to watch in action. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may not be entirely unique, the movie has enough charm for you to keep watching. Our protagonists are friendly and interesting, ensuring that the public is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon who would devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the character who will fall most in love. A small blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English, Hector provides comic relief in a way Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would recommend watching dragon hunters if you have the opportunity. Watch it for incredible animation, breathtaking fight scenes, and a glimpse of a world unlike anything you've seen on a movie or TV screen. At least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half, no matter if you're nine or twenty-nine (which I'm actually)!
