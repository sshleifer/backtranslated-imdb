Ah, black. My favorite genre Otto Preminger's sequel to "Laura" is a black film set in a post-war New York, where corruption and violence are rampant. We see Dana Andrews playing Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics landed him among his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is about to reach his goal when he engages with the late Morgan Taylor's wife. Of course, in the typical black style, things deteriorate quickly. <br /> <br /> While the movie does not do anything interesting, it has a constant tone of dread and sadness. Like most great blacks, it is also wonderfully rhythmic, sucking the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Yet, like most of Preminger's top-quality films, it's not something I would look at again. It lacks Wilder's verbal spirit, Hitchcock's visual flamboyance, or Welles' space experimentation. Like Lang's latest work, "Sidewalk" really feels like a "clone" of what a black should be, instead of something really artistic. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the film is nothing special. This is a police officer who is slowly becoming a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father was himself a little crook, the movie flirting with the notion of predestination, but this scene is as far away as Otto goes or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is also disappointing. There is no intelligence in Otto's camera. No effort is made to assign the camera to anything. It does not play with space or architecture, nor empahsise police procedures step by step. These are only tripods with the occasional trolley. It does not make sense, even though most people are not interested in these things. <br /> <br /> There is however a good blow where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (black cage) which enters itself in a car lift (another cage) and is taken away in the gang of the leader lair. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet," Otto re-questions the film, and constantly compares "from above" to hell. It works well, but the decor design fails to strengthen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems happy to follow the hawksian mold of what is black, rather than playing with the possibilities of knowing where black can go. Like "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In an Isolated Place", "Act of Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is one of them. makes second-rate black films. It's competent and attractive, but it misses that special magic.
