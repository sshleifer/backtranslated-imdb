Allen and Julie move into a cabin in the mountains after the murder of their daughter one night. Nobody knows who killed the little girl but that's why they went to the mountains. So the couple moves into this cabin and is haunted by people who have killed themselves and no one in the neighboring city wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of creeps and it has a lot of pieces that made me jump. Some parts are predictable, but from time to time, I did not expect a party. It was a very good movie that was not the scariest movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good. <br /> <br /> I also liked the end because the viewer had to decide how it ends. It's also a bit of a sad movie, but a horror movie well done.
