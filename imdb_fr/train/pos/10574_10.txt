It's a beautiful movie. Non-stop behavior requires several monitors to be fully appreciated. The musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated. I think this film easily exceeds all his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are amazing together. Some of the humor would be almost beyond the limits of today's movies. Put the rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the show that it is.
