Excellent film about the life of an old man who turns over the years. From around 1910, he remembers his boy and his young adulthood; his family, his friends, his romances, etc. A very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finish ... "all things in life are united to make one and a river crosses it and this river haunts me". Worth to be seen.
