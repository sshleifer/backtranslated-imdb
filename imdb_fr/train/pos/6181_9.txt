A very nice film, provided you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. It may not be close to the mysteries of Agatha Christie or even Thin Man as a film noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical "boy meets girl" comedy or "put on a show" ". As a musical, it's not Busby Berkley or Freed, but it can reinforce the classic "Coctails for two" and the strange "Sweet Marijuana". The film takes place in real time during a show, the opening night of "Vanities", where a murder - and soon another - is discovered behind the scenes. Is the assassin discovered before the curtain falls? Of course, but the research is fun, even if it is somewhat predictable and darkened by comic reliefs of relief (fortunately in the form of the gallant goddess of the choruses, Toby Wing). The stupid policeman is just a little too stupid, the main hero is a little too friendly, the main woman is a little too kind, the bitchy prima is a little too bitchy, and the lover is a little too sacrificial, but As far as Go stereotypes, they are pretty stylish. There are a lot of really gorgeous choir girls, who are even better chosen than girls for a Busby Berkley musical from the same period, which sometimes tend to be a bit plump. Yes, this movie could have been much better than it is, and Duke Ellington's figure is embarrassing, but if you like to dive into old movies, this trip will be extremely tempting.
