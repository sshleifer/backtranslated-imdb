Sensational. What a wonderful movie. The scenario is almost perfect, it seems to be the only film written by Minglun Wei. I hope he has more stories in him. <br /> <br /> The acting game is sublime. Renying Zhou as a Doggie was amazing - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a delight - very believable as a jaded old traditionist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has been very effective, guiding without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only more movies like this were shot in Hollywood or Hong Kong, a family jewel, well done, well written, well directed and close to perfection.
