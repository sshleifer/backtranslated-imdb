This is a wonderful new detective series bringing together three former pillars of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong), which retired detectives have brought back to help solve old cases, under the direction of Amanda Redman, younger and career-focused. The three old eccentric and irritable police officers are a brilliant team applying twenty-year-old detection methods to a police force that has come a long way since, sometimes with effect, sometimes under the horror of their senior officers. The three are portrayed with sympathy, warts and all. There are beautiful comic scenes, and very moving scenes, because each of the three has to deal with aging and the legacy of its past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we are promised another series next year) each character has developed. The widower James Bolam can not accept the untimely death of his wife. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept his role as grandfather. And even obsessed Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and continues to take the drugs! While Amanda Redman faces the familiar conflict between having a life and a career. The scenarios were interesting, although highly dependent on the wonders of DNA testing. But it is the interaction of four of the best British actors that made the series a must.
