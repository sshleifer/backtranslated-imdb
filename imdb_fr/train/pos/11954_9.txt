Great movie, enough laughs and action for all types of spectators. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who wrote this film took the initiative to call Woody Allen incest and not to comment on the film, I'm here. <Br/> <br /> The film follows an unlikely pair, Johansson and Allen, who are following a tip given by the ghost of a recently deceased English journalist. Their search takes them to the murderer's home and ends in a somewhat tragic end. But do not let the plot deceive you, the movie is really hilarious and the acting is superb. <br /> <br /> It seems that when directors reach a certain age, they really succeed. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to have done the most imaginative work of their respective careers. Also, watching the movie in a pact theater, you can say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to make a comeback. The second, he stepped on the audience of the illuminated screen. There is just something about the man and he really shines in Scoop. <br /> <br /> Look, it's worth the trip.
