WARNING!!! Tons of dying gifts !!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SERIES! WHERE YOU CAN, WHATEVER. <br /> <br /> These are a few words to describe a film that claims to be the last and comes out with another one; Liars, Cheats, maybe even a few words that can not be pronounced. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows anyone who thought the series was getting older and wanted to stop seeing it, or those who wanted their hero (or Villian) just stop for his last breath, this movie was on. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a parody of the Wizard of Oz. Then you see a child named John Doe, the last child from Springwood, Ohio, leaving Freddy's territory. A woman who resides in a hospital / place to get the children to get up is a kind of place that meets this boy and who at the same time dreams of a man, a water tower and the promise of a secret that floats in his head, returns to Springwood to understand this frightening vision and quickly discovers that she is Freddy's child. And we soon discover that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a kind of host to him. And beyond that, fear follows. This movie seems to hit the wire of everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This film has tons of humor and cameo appearances, such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and a very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees the psychadelic vision of flowers and "In-a-gadda-da-vida" Iron Butterfly, then finds himself stuck in a kind of super parody of Mario. This movie will make you hate this movie, or more like Krueger. The best of the best.
