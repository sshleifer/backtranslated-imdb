Honestly, it's the best reality show ever created. To make money, you have to be really INTELLIGENT. Not only must you be brave, athletic, cunning, etc. It actually requires skills. Not like some lame shows that are taking place these days. And yet, they only have two seasons! Bull..they need to bring back this show !! <br /> <br /> Although they have trouble getting out Anderson Cooper from CNN. He was great. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was an incredible sight. You never knew who would go when. And it was so much fun to try to find the mole yourself! It was a show you could play if you wanted! <br /> <br /> BRING BACK THE MOLE !!!! Bring back the mole !!!!
