I really enjoyed the performance of the main distribution. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed performances where the characters are not one-dimensional. A complex story with the change between eras. We also enjoyed the story behind the union's loss of power and the effect of a big employer closing down on a small town. I do not agree with the comment that the older man must be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without the boy being handsome. The depth of character can be attractive to the less deep. The film has a beautiful aspect and the cinematography is also good.
