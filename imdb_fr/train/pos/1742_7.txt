Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I have seen in the last ten years. Excellent performances (especially yiannis zouganelis, it's great), a well-written script and an effective, very special direction for the average Greek standards, author. A film, obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, which could be a masterpiece if it ultimately avoided obvious and exaggerated situations and symbolization. Nevertheless, this is a film that deserves our attention and is part of this rare category of Greek films that should be watched outside of Greece. Too bad that in Greece it did not work commercially, in addition to other big false and superficial productions like Politiki Kouzina.
