DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a huge surprise. It contains remarkable actors (especially Callan, an underrated man), a beautiful cinematography and a captivating screenplay. In other words, this is one of the finest horror efforts of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer dreaming of murdering his models, while he find his brother psychologically explosive. (missing an arm and a leg). When the models that Callan dreams of killing are dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity ... but the image is not limited to what he sees. <br /> <br /> This film has never received merit praise. Most critics and moviegoers confuse it with the horde of slasher films released at the same time, but they remain above most of this sad fate. It's smart and unique, which can not comfortably be said of most films of this kind, but it's also a work that is passionately designed and interpreted. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a jewel of this kind.
