Typical film of De Palma made with great style and some scenes that will take you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> The style is certainly what makes this film better as an average thriller. It contains scenes brilliantly mounted and really trying scenes that will take you to the edge of your seat. The best scene is the movie. The museum scene and the elevator murder. There are some light erotic scenes and the rhythm of the movies may not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this film. So this movie might not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also very good, but it's really the style that makes the movie work! This may be reserved for fans, but casual viewers should also appreciate the growing tension in the film. <br /> <br /> Some nice characters are portrayed by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice and Angie Dickinson behaves as well as she is beautiful (not bad for a 49 year old!). <br /> <br /> The musical score of Pino Donaggio is also typically De Palma likes and suits the film very well, as is his score for De Palma's other film, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant thriller. I love Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
