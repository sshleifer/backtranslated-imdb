A high-end Columbo from start to finish. I particularly like the interaction between Columbo and the murderer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of Columbo, I do not remember another where he did not put the killer to the end, done in other episodes. In this one, as he tries to determine the correct sequence of boxes and the "message" that the nephew has left behind, he finally wakes up. <br /> <br /> The music of this episode is very good too, as in many others.
