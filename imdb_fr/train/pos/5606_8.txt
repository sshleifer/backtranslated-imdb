It's a very difficult film, and it's almost impossible to understand what's going on. At first, it seems to be a rather pedestrian film about a guy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and is rather rude in an apartment when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then, the twists begin. Do the neighbors try to kill him? And why do the deceased tenant's clothes end up in the apartment? Finally, one may wonder if Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the things Polanski pulls on us is to lie to us. We assume, when we see things from a character's point of view, that we see them as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume that when the camera shows things from its omniscient point of view, we see the news - but Polanski lied to us.
