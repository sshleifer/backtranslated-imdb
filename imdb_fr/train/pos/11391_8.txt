An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Watch Gene sing, act and dance through Paris in all kinds of situations. Some purely majestic, others pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly looked like when he directed this movie just one year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is certainly one of the greatest of all time. It's interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters. The only major difference is that one is based in Paris, the other in LA. Some said Leslie Caron's role was less than pure. Maybe Cyd Charisse, who was originally destined for this role, could have done better, but Caron is quite credible in the role and has chemistry with Kelly. The short role of Oscar Levant in this film gave him what he needed, someone who does not look like Gene Kelly. To fulfill the role of everyday player is not an easy task, but Levant did it with as much class as any other leading role. <br /> <br /> The singing and dancing routines are all perfect. Even the ballet too long at the end of the film makes a better film than without. Seeing that there was not much time on the screen to make such a loving relationship credible, Minnelli used this footage to make you feel like you had spent four hours with them. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I should note this movie with Singin 'because it is very similar in the story and the song. Singin 'would have barely got the better of Debbie Reynolds' uplifting performance. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
