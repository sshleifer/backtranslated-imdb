I thought this movie was very good. Some pieces were lame but it's understandable since its manufacture more than 55 years ago. I thought the best performance of the movie was Michele Morgan, who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good like Mike O'Brien. Even though I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good at this film. If you fancy a silly and crazy musical, Higher and Higher is the film for you. <br /> <br />
