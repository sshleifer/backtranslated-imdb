This film must be my favorite of all time. It's not supposed to have a plot, because its makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe it's a real snuff. It was a visual effects exercise, which has no impact on the action, like all other films. Nowadays, movies are entirely devoted to sound effects, which leaves visual images created by computer, because it is easier to manage the blood of the CGI. There are still filmmakers who still can not get fake blood to look like the real thing. There is no rape scene because that was not the reason for making the film. Did you see the hills have eyes 2? The rape scene was funny instead of shocking. Although I'm sure, some GONZO porn directors have tried to associate porn with horror. But since they're probably crazy about making movies, they probably could not get away with it. The movie "Fuck Me" has a disturbing rap scene because the actresses are actually pornstars and they show everything, even if the film is really bad. <br /> <br /> Too bad a film can not be shot without thinking. money, especially when it is an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to dramatically improve his hostel movie series, but he has tamed it too much to get R ... or at least I hope his films were destroyed because of these limitations. <br /> <br /> Look at traces of death or more than crushed pumpkins if you want real pictures without frills (scenes of accidents and crime). Do not forget that this film was shot in 1985. The fact that it can still withstand most bullshit made today says a lot about this movie. It would be like someone saying that 8-bit Super Mario Brothers was nil because the PS3 has better graphics.
