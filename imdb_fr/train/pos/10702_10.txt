According to critics and the public, BIRTHDAY GIRL must have been a big clinker. However, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It turned out to be quite worthy of watching. Of course, it's not your basic American comedy, and it does not take a genius to realize that it's a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other movies, a breath of fresh air. Of course, there were some field holes, but overall it worked. First of all, Kidman was again fabulous in a very different role, not very glamorous, but still very sexy. She continues to prove that she is one of the best talents in Hollywood. Not only does her Russian accent when she speaks English is effective, but sometimes she has long conversations in Russian and if you did not know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have taken note in "K-19". Overall, a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz.
