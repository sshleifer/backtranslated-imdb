I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning in movies or consider them worthless. <br /> <br /> Why not be entertained? Something for which Morgan Freeman excels. He has the opportunity to show a little. Paz Vega, his co-star, has a boost for his career and Brad Silberling has a name that encourages people to watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. A little humor, a little pathos, a bit of sweetness but nothing too much. I particularly liked Jim Parsons as a receptionist at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman with adoration and says, "You make me feel like a woman." He's just hilarious. The fight scene between Mrs. Vega, her ex-husband and his girlfriend, is also beautiful. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a charming and charming movie that will make you smile. You could do a lot, much worse.
