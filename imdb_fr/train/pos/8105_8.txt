SYNOPSIS The future seen from 1939 in England. While the war was threatening Europe, the salvation of humanity will not be found in the politics of the past. It belongs to the brave new world of science to overcome the errors of man's past. <br /> <br /> CONCEPT FROM THE READER Pay attention to your leaders and what you are told. Getting off the beaten track can lead to a better future. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> BENEFITS AND DISADVANTAGES I saw this movie a long time ago and I recently downloaded it on the internet (it is in the public domain). It's a fascinating job on many levels. Since this is a story about the future as it has been seen since 1939, it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is both terrifying and fanciful. This film was at the forefront of technology for his day. The special effects are very good, as is the plot. Dramatic play suffers somewhat in the British theatrical sense, as it may tilt slightly in favor of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems. now to know is not always true. The other plot of the film is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and they will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> The fundamentals of almost all subsequent science fiction movies are visible in this film. The scenography and the wardrobe of "Forbidden Planet", the technological failures of "2001: A Space Odessy", even the lush landscapes / urban landscapes of "Star Wars" owe their inspiration to this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the viewer a little perplexed. Although optimistic in its final sequence of reaching the stars, we wonder if humanity will be able to do it. Even when we reach, there are those who try to hold us back. This filmed vision of the future while being interesting is also a bit humorous compared to current standards. Huge flying machines and guns capable of firing people into space never materialized in the real world, but they were considered in 1939 as the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors are in this film when they were young. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized and their speaking skills are evident here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the main character, Cabel. His character almost appears as the new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece of film history whose themes are still relevant, even if vision of the future has missed the target.
