James Stewart plays the lead role in the classic story of Western vengeance, which is tied to the fate of the other star of the film, the Winchester Rifle. Stewart is, needless to say, excellent, adding some obsession to his usual cowboy. The story tells the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after being won at a competition by our hero and stolen by the man she hunts. <br /> <br /> We meet a selection of players, firearms and Indian traders. and the bank robbers as we follow the rifle path through Indian battles, bank robberies, and so on. The main actors are all solid. Dan Durya stands out as Waco Johnny Dean the sniper with a prickly finger. An anecdote will also be the very early appearance of Rock Hudson as Indian Chief. <br /> <br /> The final clash is a classic intense rifle fight taking place at a distance in and around a rocky outcrop. Embark on a good old-fashioned Western action, fist fights, shootings and horse chases, making it a captivating western adventure. 8/10
