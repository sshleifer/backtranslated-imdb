Fourth in the "Dirty Harry" series, this film presents one of the most despicable, ugliest, most unpleasant, most profane and disgusting women I've ever seen in the movie: "Ray Perkins" , played by Audrie Neenan. She is the low and modern version of the 1945 "Detour" character, "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> His impetuous mouth and gutter attitude shocked me so much that I did not watch this movie before I bought it. a profane filter that shut her up ... and at least a part of her! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wherever "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, the violence follows immediately ..... a few minutes later! It happens so often that it's almost laughable, but it's a fast and entertaining film with a satisfying end, as all the bad scumbag are eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our basic instincts ..... and connects, sad to say. Most of us would like to see those dust balls make themselves clear in the end, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
