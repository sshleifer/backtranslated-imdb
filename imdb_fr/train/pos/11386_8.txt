An American In Paris is an integrated musical, which means that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story. The film is inspired by George Gershwin's 1928 orchestral composition. <br /> <br /> The film's story is interspersed with cutting-edge dance numbers choreographed by Gene Kelly and popular Gershwin tunes. The songs and music include "I Got Rhythm", "Wonderful" and "Our love is here to stay". He set a new standard for the subgenus known as the musical songbook with dozens of Gershwin melodies buried in the underscore. The climax is the ballet "The American in Paris", an 18-minute dance starring Kelly and Caron in Gershwin's An American in Paris, featuring a reverie of the impressionist period in the manner of various painters. one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any Hollywood movie. Ballet alone cost over half a million dollars, a huge sum at the time. <br /> <br /> It's funny to think of such a work of art born on a billiard game between film producer Arthur Freed (SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN, WIZARD OF OZ, ON THE CITY, MEET -MOI TO ST LOUIS AND THE BAND WAGON) and Ira Gershwin. It was Freed's idea to buy the title so he could use it in a film about Paris and Gershwin's idea that she would only use Gershwin's music. <br /> <br /> The original cast was Cyd Charisse, but she found out she was pregnant. before the start of the shoot. One of the main reasons why Gene Kelly suggested Leslie Caron to play the female lead was that he felt the film needed a "real" French girl playing Lise, not just an American actress. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while on vacation in Paris, where he saw her perform in a ballet. When she was summoned to an audition, she said, "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, her introductory dance sequence, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was deemed too suggestive by some critics. Gene Kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences presented at Lise's presentation. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in the Georges Gu√©tary section and 'Celeste Holm' in the 'Nina Foch' section. <Br /> <br /> Minnelli was an innovative director of musicals with Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), An American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used color and songs in a way that had never been used before. He used space and time with imagination. Better still, he allowed himself to indulge in the long ballet sequences that end all his films. The ballet in An American in Paris is perhaps his best work. <br /> <br /> Even though Vincente Minnelli is recognized as the only director, he is sometimes tied to his divorce from Judy Garland and other projects, leaving Gene Kelly to assume the leadership role. . <br /> <br /> Guetary translation of "Stairway to Paradise"; Oscar Levant's fantasy of directing and performing Gershwin's "Concerto in F" (see why he was Oscar Levant's favorite.) <br /> <br /> The ballet sequence, now that we know that he has succeeded, everyone wants to take credit, Liberated, Minnelli, Kelly ?? but before the end of the film, the MGM office in New York refused to spend half a million dollars for a ballet. So, Freed himself went to the Louis B. Mayer studio and accepted it, New York said no. Finally, Gene Kelly showed the New York office how a British film, THE RED SHOES, used a long ballet sequence and that film was a worldwide success ?? and is still considered today as the best example of a successful art film. The financiers ended up giving in and signing the checks. <br /> <br /> After November 1, 1950, production was interrupted. It was then that Gene Kelly began to repeat the ballet choreography. When production of this last sequence resumed on December 6, Vincente Minnelli completed the production of another film - Father's Little Dividend (1951). <br /> <br /> Irene Sharaff designed a style for each of the sets of ballet sequences, reflecting various French Impressionist painters: "Raoul Dufy" (Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (The Flower Market), Mauritius Utrillo (a street in Paris), Henri Rousseau (the fair), "Vincent Van Gogh" (Opera), and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (the Moulin Rouge). The sets lasted six weeks, with 30 painters working tirelessly. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert said after viewing the recent restoration: "An American in Paris has many qualities, including his famous ballet production number, with Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolizing the whole story of their "An American in Paris is often compared to SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN for which he is the greatest musical comedy of all time, and a critic says it best:" SINGIN' IN THE RAIN makes me happy and a American in Paris makes me feel good. " The ballet represents the fantasies of Kelly described by the great French artists he admires (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy). By organizing a screening for Raoul Dufy, then in difficulty, the actor and producer hid to the end credits. Relieved, they found the artist, moved to tears, asking for a second help for the sumptuous finale. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win the Golden Globe Award for best film (comedy or musical). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly received an honorary Academy Award this year -for "his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and more particularly for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography in the cinema". It was his only Oscar.
