A pretty memorable movie about the variety of deadly animals, which looks particularly like "Willard" in that it features an aging actor (in this case, a little lower than the Tremayne, the performance I'm doing I saw him give) in a role of man whose life is unbalanced and who later decides to use his friends the animals to avenge those who have wronged him. Yes, it's one of those films where almost everyone is despicable, so that you encourage their death, and the choice of actors, places, etc. could not be better to give the film a shabby decadence. <br /> <br /> The character of Tremayne is "Snakey Bender", and it is certainly the most interesting thing in the film: an old snake collector obsessed with the music of John Philip Souza. When the local preacher represses his practice of collecting small animals from schoolchildren in the area as bait for his snakes, and his friend marries a stripper (thus upsetting the ritual of his Wednesday night concert), he is unleashed creating a memorable stack of clunkers under the cliff where he lays wrecks after yielding their unfortunate owners. A fun game that you can play while watching "Snakes" is to place bets on which the cars will land the furthest on the cliff. <br /> <br /> In total, very cheap and exploiting, but will be really a lot of fun for fans of these types of movies.
