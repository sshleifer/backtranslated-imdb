I would not be surprised if Soderbergh was under pressure to avoid making Cuba before the revolution as corrupt as possible. Reciting some statistics will not be enough to attract young people. Nevertheless, the first part, almost entirely shot in the jungle, perfectly restores the sensation of this place, especially during the crossing of the mountainous regions of Cuba. I liked the interpretation of Che Guevara's personality by Del Toro. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, has also done a great job, against all odds. It is clear that Soderbergh does not despise these people, but he is not going to plead their cause in favor of a "yanquis" far removed from the recent past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict what I read. To my knowledge, Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all US attempts to win acceptance were exhausted. But in other respects, he is right, especially with regard to the looting by expatriates while the island controlled other rebels. The country's treasury remained empty.
