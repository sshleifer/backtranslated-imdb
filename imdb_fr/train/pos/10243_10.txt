it's great i loved ha because i love dinosaurs it's the biggest animals but i loved the show because it was not copied from another show and it's an original ha it's a good story for small children (if they like dinosaurs) i have some problems too, it's not quite a good cause that dinosaurs look a little mutated; I should have had a 7, but at the moment, it's a little late for yay 4 other lines, it's great for a fantastic show although it can spoil a part for you so if you do not want not that it's wasted, do not read on PLZ near the end is a bit weird because all they need is to become dang I forget what it was so nvm guess it's not a spoiler , so whatever, I liked it and that's my opinion and sorry for the missing spelled words
