Probably one of the best examples of tracking a dramatic and suspenseful episode (in this case, the superb Balance of Terror) of a lighter affair, Shore Leave is the first real attempt on the part of Star's writers Trek to produce a more entertaining piece of music. science fiction, and although the formula is not quite right yet in this entry (the real triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, Season 2), the laughter arrives fast enough so the viewer is ready to tolerate any foolishness. <br /> <br /> Deviating from the tradition of the series, the Enterprise has no specific mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk found a perfect planet to allow his crew to spend free time: a well-deserved break after three months of constant work. The Earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: Dr. McCoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to be coming out all right from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people begin to experience similar experiences: a woman meets a character similar to Don Juan, Sulu meets a samurai and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the form of almost love and type who used it. take it to the Academy. Add a strangely real tiger and you'll understand why Kirk and Spock are determined to understand what's going on before anyone gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The idea is classic: an idyllic place is revealed to be far from paradise. The humor of the episode on the subject is rather successful, would it not for a dark turn of events that does not go with the rest (of course, everything goes well until the end) and the general reluctance of the cast to show a more funny side of themselves (more particularly, and ironically, William Shatner, otherwise hilarious). And yet, Shore Leave deserves to be recognized as another good example of writers trying out new things: the definition of Star Trek's success. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
