What can I say about a tale like this? This magical tale has followed me since my earliest childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to many fantasy places that make you want each scene. For example, in the market, there were so many different flavors. I loved the exotic dancers accompanying the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The story was wonderful.I wanted so much that Landsbury decided to keep the children early and that she also stayed with Mr.Brown, and find the other half of the spell so that the less armed men can win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a kid inside, and this film appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my favorite of all time. I hope all children will be able to watch this classic and be carried away and transported to another time.
