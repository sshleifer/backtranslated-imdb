I was afraid my daughter might have a bad idea. I think that the character of "Dark-Heart" is a little rough and I do not like the way he turns into a "medium" frog, fox, boy ?? I was wrong, this movie was made for my child, not for me. She "understands" when he passes over my head. Of course I do not understand. This is NOT one of the NEW children's movies that adults will enjoy ALSO. It's straightforward for the younger ones and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no undesirable political ether. There is no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, no one has the right to access excesses, and not everyone is happy all the time. And besides, nobody dies! ?? russwill.
