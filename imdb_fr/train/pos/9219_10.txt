The film itself made me want to call someone so he could enjoy it too. It was extremely funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful like Juliet. The parents are hilarious.They are both caterers and enemies.Children play the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the church game.They fall in love and their parents try to separate them. after a party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like the stereotypes and stains of classical literature, do not look. If you do not mind, you'll have a lot of fun watching this one.
