I had the chance to watch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror movies and especially William Castle's gimmicks, so it was really a must for me. <br /> <br /> This is the life and work of William Castle, who in my opinion was an underrated director. True, he made cheap low-budget horror movies, but he added something to these films: real theater gadgets that you do not see anymore. For example, he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack on his movies and put vibrators at the bottom of the chairs in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> It's really a well done documentary and brings this director rather dark in the light, and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema. He also presents Castle as a larger-than-life character, highly appreciated and with a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most film documentaries that mainly feature testimonials from film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows mostly interviews with family members and filmmakers influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. A must for classic horror and sci-fi fans.
