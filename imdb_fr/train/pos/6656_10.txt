This film is just awesome. It was a very sensitive subject and the film was superb. This film was not controversial in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was also kept at a minimum. In principle, I thought that this film would be simply a waste of time since most Indian filmmakers and producers used to change the theme even if it is very sensitive and adds a love story in a original story and spoils it all ... most Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they do not forget Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, etc. <br /> <br /> There have been so many movies in India that would have become milestones or mega hits if the love story part was not to be added unnecessarily. <br /> But his treatment is quite similar to that of the movie Pinjar (also to look absolutely). <br /> <br /> If that counts, I want to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making such a good movie ..
