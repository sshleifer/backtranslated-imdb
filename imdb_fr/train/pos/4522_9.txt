It took me by surprise, because Adrian Pasdar had often disappointed me in the past, but he found the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both the joke and the pathetic while offering humor and real emotions. Julie Waters, always wonderful, is great here, and anyone who has not seen her in Rita Educating in 1983, should rent it immediately (wonderful film). The other characters are also very well played, many wonderfully eccentric without going beyond. This one is fun.
