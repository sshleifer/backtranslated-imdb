In what must be one of the coldest movies of all time, a transvestite murderer of people in New York, and the answer to everything is perhaps not what people suspect. We can see how Brian DePalma draws some influence from Hitchcock with the angles of shooting and others. Michael Caine plays a very provocative character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a rich and bored woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later played in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you can not really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you may never know who you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
