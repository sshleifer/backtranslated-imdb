It's a better adaptation of the book than Paltrow's (though I liked that too). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but the scenario is better. Davies is an adaptation expert from Austen for filming, and the production values ​​are very good. It's not as brilliant as the Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the venues and costumes worked better.
