The main reason I had to watch this film is that it's the lead role of Susan Swift, an exceptional and underrated actress. Time travel films do not usually interest me, nor movies about witchcraft, but this film was fascinating and terrifying. He did not rely on scandalous special effects and did not put so much emphasis on time travel that the viewer went astray and lost himself. It was a really creative film, simple and focused, with excellent interpretation by all.
