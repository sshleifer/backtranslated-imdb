I have just finished listening to the director's comments on this film, and I think the most important thing I agree with is that this film, like Mann's The Insider, is totally subjective. This comes from Howard's point of view. Thus, any examination or attempt to reflect on a set of comments on it, as Ebert did, is really about Nolte's character. If you feel, as he did, that the movie "does not work", then you say, I think, that Howard does not work. And, to be honest, you might be right. Howard's reasoning and personality would not really stand up to professional mental processing and analysis. <br /> <br /> But, hey, that's the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
