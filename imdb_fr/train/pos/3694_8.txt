I did not know what to expect from this film, given its amazing collection of stars and directors, but in the end, it was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the highlights was the last episode with the American tourist. speaking with a dreadful French accent (which made me feel better with mine) which was actually very touching and a great way to wrap up the movie. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and the stabbed victim was also moving, and for pure comedy the brothers Coen and Steve Buscemi won the award. The clip of Tom Tykwer was also impressive, although he is ambitious enough in its extent. <br /> <br /> However, Bob Hoskins' segment was totally foolish and the vampire story was completely far-fetched. The dialogue in Wes Craven's section also felt very forced and the story of Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is worthy of being guided for the good sides and its finish is excellent. It's not too painful to get through the wrong sections - they only last 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's worth it !!!
