While browsing the weekly Sci Fi section of the local Video Rentals store, I lost hope of finding good movies that I had not seen yet. Rent Cypher looked like a pot on a horse maybe very lame. My son is so jaded with science fiction "B" that he has not bothered to see it yet. <br /> <br /> You must know that I did not see anything of Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just missed it. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a very pleasant surprise! It's not a B movie either. It's not a blockbuster of epic variety and does not try to be more of a silent movie that has to be seen many times before its plot is fully savored. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerful. presented when used - my only complaint is that the super helicopter is a leetle obviously CGI at first sight, but they understood everything from the second appearance, and apart from everything else is top. In all cases, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything about the plot. The structure of the plot has a Russian doll look that reminds a little Basic Instinct (although its content is very different). <br /> <br /> I will simply say that Jeremy Northam's choice for the lead role was a master stroke. The actor was born in Cambridge, England, and his focus for this film hits the ear as a kind of extremely constrained dialect of New England, it's a touch tass off. See the last twist of the plot and you'll see why it's such a brilliant choice! And Lucy Liu is also right with her edge "Will she kiss me - will she shoot me". <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies multiple times in a few days - it's one of them.
