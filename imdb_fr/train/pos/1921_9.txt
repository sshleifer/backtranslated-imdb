ABC did more for the show by allowing TV veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast. At first, the show was watchable and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three children really form a strong professional cast. The lesson of an hour after John's death in real life struck me. I lost my father at age 17 and could understand and understand their pain and agony. ABC should be proud to maintain this show and even keep it as John's final wish. This show has matured and developed because of these impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded by Emmys.
