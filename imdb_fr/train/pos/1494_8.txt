A chic offer from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ("The Far Pavillions", etc.) is an elegant "four man" with a solid cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.). all offering elegant performance, despite a low budget, which gives some "non-special effects". The most notable contribution, however, is that of 7-year-old Chloe Franks, who is frighteningly effective in reporting her cold side. This underrated film, which is well above the shock movie 'Blood' n 'Guts', is underestimated for those who appreciate a little reflection with their horror. .
