I had the pleasure of seeing this wonderful film last night, with the wonderful addition of a Q & A session with the director after the viewing. I suspect that the first responder never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. I had a lot of such losses, and this movie told me. One of the main themes is how we do not deal with issues / problems / stories with our loved ones until it is too late - they are too disabled or dead before that happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen and record their stories, tell the people you love, solve the differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes. I like the director's portrayal of the relationship between the two girls. As a brother and sister, he clearly understands how complex these relationships are. His story as director of photography is also obvious: what a beautiful movie! The cast is exceptional - a movie not to be missed!
