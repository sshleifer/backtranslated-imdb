Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you can see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I guarantee you that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This film is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and throughout this time, there was hardly a moment when I did not laugh. You will laugh for hours after the end, ironing the lines again and again in your head. Eddie Murphy has given so many entertaining performances during his career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming To America, Professor Nutty, Shrek, etc.), but this is by far his moment the more hilarious. I have seen this film so many times, and it's always funnier. He never loses his advantage. From this day on, every big stand-up performance will be imitated from Delirious. ***** and two bravo!
