I will start by telling my first encounter with Prince's music. It was in a bar, the day of my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare chest until "1999" playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I was told it was Prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, naked topless dancer. Later, I started hearing other songs from Prince and really "digging" them. When Purple Rain came out, I still knew very little about this Minnesotan comrade. The movie blew me away. I instantly became Prince's # 1 fan of the "War Baby" generation. Later, I discovered that one of my cousins ​​was her secretary and she took me, along with my nephew, to a VIP Prince concert where we sat next to her mother ... c that's cool! To come back to the subject, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who called Purple Rain a classic. I have seen it more than 17 times and I love it. I thought Prince's game was fine, Apollonia had some difficulties, but overall, everything was going well. John Gielgud is not available to play 'The Kid', so Prince takes the role. The film is visually striking, rhythmically brilliant (it never becomes slow) and terribly realized. I rank it among the best musical movies of all time. The last time I watched the movie was after a gap of about 7 years and the result was still valid. I am so proud of the Prince of Minnesota, Prince Rogers Nelson, and would like to tell him personally. He walked in front of me during the concert mentioned above and said "hello" to my nephew but not to me. He was talking to his mother. I was a little crushed but he is still # 1 with me.
