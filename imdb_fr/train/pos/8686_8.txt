The second official episode of the series "Columbo" ("Murder by the Book", filmed later, was broadcast first). Robert Culp, who will compete with Peter Falk's detective in later editions, is great as the short-term leader of a sophisticated private detective agency that murders a client's wife when she refuses to give in to his blackmail ploys. The two stars are well matched in this clever exercise of cat and mouse that is one of the best in the series.
