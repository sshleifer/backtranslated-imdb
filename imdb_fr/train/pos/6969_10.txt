First of all, it's an excellent series, although we have a sort of James Bond effect. What I mean is that if the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, while Dr. No (1962) is the second. While in Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is referred. How was she able to be in place early before Bond became a double-0, apart from the fact that she's obviously 14 years older? It's more or less a "poetic" license to thrill. We need to turn our heads a bit if we want to entertain ourselves. No, the new Star Trek movie does not have the original electronics of the original series of nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fantastic. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. OMG, do you think that in 400 years they would have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, give the producers a little room for maneuver. <br /> <br /> But for things to be a bit coherent, let us think about creating Cylons just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where do all the Cylons who populated the original Earth come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps in space. Well, what if one of the Cyclon ships in war with the Caprica fleet is targeted or if there is a sunspot or any object and a ship loaded with Cylons to the Human look, ends up not only by jumping through space, but in time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One. They colonized it, discovered that they could repopulate it and end up destroying themselves, but not before they themselves sent a fleet of "scavengers" in search of the legendary Caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, which they colonized to become humans. , who finally invented the Cylons. Temporal paradox? Of course. Which one came first, the chicken or the road? We do not care? It's funny!
