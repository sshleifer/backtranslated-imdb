It's a sublime movie. It flows at a fair pace. The accompaniment music is perfect and is very pleasant to the ear. The humorous parts are hilarious and even more rendered by the tragic tragic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> However, despite the many comments on the tragedy inherent in the screenplay, I could not look depressingly. I really enjoyed it in a way that I had not experienced for a long time. That is, it is superb and yet devoid of all the common attributes of modern movies such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" lacks nothing to do without the usual vices. It has a fully matured plot that does not require, and would indeed be ruined by, any additional embellishment. At the same time, the theme is entirely adult. It's a work of art in itself that completely encapsulates you and you want nothing more than it already offers. <br /> <br /> Some scenes look a little "Walton", but they have a perfect sense In the long run, they contrast with the most dysfunctional moments. The rose gives way to the tragic, which then gives way to the idyllic which turns to dark, etc. This hilly landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a stability similar to that of lithium. The peaks and troughs are soft but more than enough for the pleasure they provide. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie, no matter what genre you normally like. Set aside all the prejudices because it's a must see!
