I have not watched this movie and the show for a long time, but now I'm refreshing my memory! It was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse direct Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes to leave their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around the local Hogg construction site and find charcoal samples. They soon realize that Boss Hogg is going to strip Hazzard County, unless the dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only problem with the movie was that Burt Reynolds was not good for Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was far too serious. Other than that, I highly recommend THE DUKES OF HAZZARD !!!
