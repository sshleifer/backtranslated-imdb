Very interesting. The turning point was not as shocking as they might have hoped and it was very old fashioned, but it made me think. It really reminded me of a world without vegetation and livestock and made me appreciate the world in which I live much more. Charlton Heston did a good job, as did all the secondary characters, and it was a very realistic and surprising film. It sometimes lacked direction and many parameters and backgrounds required more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main flaw I could find is that I did not want the movie to end so I would have liked to see what happened next. <br /> <br /> 7/10
