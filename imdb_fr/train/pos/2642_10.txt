It's really a "comforting" movie. He won the George Peobody Award, winning the "Roots" victory, which can give you an idea of ​​the essence of this film. I'm looking on the Internet how to order this film since my former father-in-law, Eugene Logan, the co-writer of this movie, has been dead for a few years now, so I do not have the opportunity to receive any more information from him . . I would love to see his films, his only granddaughters, see this movie, as well as pass on this wonderful story to his great grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven years old when she was on television and I can not wait to see her again. One of my friends said it was his favorite movie. I will not ruin this movie for you.
