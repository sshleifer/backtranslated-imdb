It was the first television episode of the Columbo series (although it was filmed after "Death Lends a Hand") and it announced one of the most successful television series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy (who played the assassin in the series three times) enthuses both for smugness, arrogance and self-confidence, just like Ken Franklin, half of a team of writers who draws up an elaborate plot to kill his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to end their professional relationship, leaving Franklin exposed as a mere journalist, rather than a prolific writer. <br /> <br /> The initial assembly of the murder is fantastic and Cassidy's performance facilitates a dubious eulogy to call it better. The murderer of Columbo in the series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is wonderfully understated in his role as Columbo and the traits inherent in the character and his quirks, underlined by apparent slowness and a distracted mind, contrast particularly well with Cassidy's extreme self-sufficiency: one of their first scenes together where Ken Franklin makes a motive for murder through Jim Ferris' nonexistent exposure to the identification of men of action operating in the underworld is a very good example. Franklin alludes to this potential motive for Columbo and Columbo (deliberately or ignorantly) fails, forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a clearly condescending manner and to compare it adversely to the detective in the books, Ms. Melville. <br /> <In addition, it is worth noting the contribution of Steven Spielberg, 24 years old, to the realization. Nevertheless, with some elemental camera inclusions shading actors and actresses, he adds some elegant and elaborate touches to maintain the overall professionalism of the episode. A particularly striking image is Jim Feriss' dead body lying on the couch, almost dark in the foreground, while Ken Franklin puts a drink in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to the clueless woman. of Ferris. There is no doubt that Spieberg's efforts should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the event of the second murder, made necessary by a system of blackmail, is planned by a woman. Franklin's friend (whom Columbo calls "sloppy" ironically in his climatic record) takes off his vigor. The intrigue of the plot is compromised and the time spent on screen between Falk and Cassidy inexcusably decreases at this stage to perhaps help the screenwriter (Stephen Bocho) to come out of a tight corner, since he can not singularly develop the story without another murder. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial jokes and word exchanges between Falk and Cassidy are executed with force and efficiency, but they only underscore the fact that it should have been more in the episode. The main aggravation lies in the sealing index (if it can be called a clue): the character and arrogance of Cassidy's character is surprisingly expelled by an index that in fact does not really imply his guilt; and once that is mentioned, it capitulates in a rather unspectacular and unusual way. <br /> <br /> All in all, a bold opening of the series, which inevitably announces and predicts all that is good for Columbo and, conversely, the problems associated with such ingenuity, that is to say the maintenance of high standards and, in particular, the creation of a credible and sufficiently intelligent end.
