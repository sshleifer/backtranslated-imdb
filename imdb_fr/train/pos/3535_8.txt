** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this game. I got it for Christmas after two months of giving up ideas to my parents. I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you're at a party in London and bad guys spoil it by kidnapping the Prime Minister's daughter. Of course, you have to save it, and the level is quite high, but it should take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I think also the funniest, is when you are in the jet pack and people are reminding Big Ben. Just equip the most reliable rocket launcher jet-pack and blow up the dials and enemies. Pure pleasure! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but quite short. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock, and this is one of the disappointments, as only the first two of them are really fun, and the last two to unlock are just goals' kill 25 enemies 'I mean, this one! We had a lot of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> The multi-player, myself and some of my friends, agree that we are very good and challenging, even if there are none. bots. Halo did not have any bots, but there are still some great multi-player games! You can be a bunch of bad guys, you fight and you can also create traps, which is the best way to kill people without making their character visible. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (sometimes there is a bad graphic, but it's not very often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (you do not need to comment, just great, drive in jet pack and vehicle). Sound - 8/10 Value of replay - 7/10 (the only levels on which I come back are the level of Loondon and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> Could have some improvement, but it's still good.
