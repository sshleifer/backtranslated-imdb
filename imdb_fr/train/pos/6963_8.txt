A big surprise, probably because I expected it to be zero. The critics showed little disdain, though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden: a man discovers that his new girlfriend is a superhero and discovers, when he wants to break up with her, psychopath. I was still expecting it to fall apart, but it never really happened. Of course, he is not doing as much of his impressive postulate as he could, and chooses to be brief while it might have been better to expand the film universe. But I can not blame you for that. Uma Thurman is great as a bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And I discovered, after several years of dislike for him, that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when interpreted as a schlub. He gave two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in Idiocracy, which has hardly been published). I completely fell in love with the expressions on his face when he and Thurman first had sex. This is one of the funniest sex scenes ever. My only complaint is that they make G-Girl a little too psychopathic, almost unbelievably. Maybe with a little experience, I could have accepted it better. I can forgive his faults, however, because I had a great time watching him. Underestimated, of course.
