I saw this film because it was the second feature film of a disc containing the movie "Blood Rites", previously banned by Video Nasty. As Blood Rites was absolutely horrible, I really did not expect much from this movie; but in reality, it would seem that filmmaker Andy Milligan outdid himself this time as Seeds of Sin beat the Blood Rites in style and stood out as a more than sufficient slice of sexual sexploitation of the sick sixties. The plot is actually quite similar to Blood Rites because we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; there is a legacy at play. The film is shot in black and white and its appearance reminded me a lot of the classic trash, "The Curious Dr Humpp". There is barely enough to watch from gore, and the director seems more inclined to focus on sex, with themes of incest and hatred shining through. The acting is typically trashy, but most women are able to appear nude at some point and despite a bad reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have an eye for that kind of stuff, because a lot of footage from that movie are actually quite beautiful. The plot is thin as paper, and most of the film is filling; but the music is catchy and the director is also doing a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, as most are somewhat erotic. Overall, it's not a good movie. but it is likely to please the fan of the sect and gets a much higher recommendation than the Blood Rites, better known and of lower quality.
