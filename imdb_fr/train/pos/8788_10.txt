Well, I'm glad to hear a rumor that it could finally be released on DVD. When that happens, I do not know it, but I'll grab it when he comes out. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when Corbett's career in "Gentleman Jim" begins in the film. Then he goes from a good movie to an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> Few people could play arrogant men and still present themselves as a good guy like Flynn. This film is a perfect example. That would be Flynn's favorite role, and I think so. You can just feel how amusing he is here. Ward Bond also seems to really appreciate his role in the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond, too, has never been better. <br /> <br /> There are just enough action boxing scenes here and they are very well done, too. Corbett's family is also fun to watch as she continues in the stands during Jim's games. Outside the arena, the arguments and screams of Corbett's family may become a little too loud and embarrassing, but they set the stage for an appropriate conclusion. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the conclusion, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the great The fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. Some petty critics (Variety, for example) did not like this ending, nor the fact that much of the film is fictional, but, damn, most movies are fictional, whether they are fictional or not. And, in this case, it gave a beautiful story and a beautiful ending. (In real life, Corbett was a real gentleman with a very soft voice, it was not Flynn's portrait at all, but Flynn still makes him a good guy.) <br /> <br /> C ' is one of my most entertaining classic movies I've ever watched and I'm looking forward to the DVD.
