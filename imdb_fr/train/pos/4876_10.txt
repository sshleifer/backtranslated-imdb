I do not know why guys from the United States, Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express their feelings about something they do not understand at all. For those who have not watched this movie, watch it. Do not expect too much or do not put some frames just because it's Kosturica. Watch the film without prejudice, try to understand all the humor inside - the Serbs get married while Bil Clinton bombards their villages, the Gypsies in all the Balkans ALWAYS try to find you in any way possible, LOVE is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claim that this is a bad movie, I can only see that American films (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) are much worse than a film of pure and frank humorous love story of the Balkans , such as Promise me. The commentary should be useful and secondly represent the personal point of view of the author. I think the film is excellent and people watching it must pay respect to the director and his story. It's simple, but true. It's brutal, but sweet and makes you laugh to death.
