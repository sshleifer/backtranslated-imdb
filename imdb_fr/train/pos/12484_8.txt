This film scared me! I must admit that I spent most of the movie watching through my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. I shouted aloud two or three times during the show. <br /> <br /> Regarding filmmaking, my favorite aspects were sound and photography. The sound was particularly good and the setting was really beautiful. I read somewhere that it was a weird husband and wife team that made it. For a reason that makes it even more foreign to me. <br /> <br /> If you like the jumps and anxieties of horror movies, this one is for you! Very exciting and a good movie to rent with a group of friends who love to watch movies huddled on a couch screaming like little girls!
