Then, Shyan enters Soha's life. <br /> <br /> A film of sensitivity and unusual story, shot with love in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. This well-designed film has moments that will forever be etched in his memory. the first clumsy kiss and the quick excuses of Abhay; Abhay describing Soha as "class wali ladki" and hastily adding "he does not like it"; he offered a churidar to Soha and asked him to go out with him. <br /> <br /> The music is good and the background music is excellent. In a scene where Soha rushes and kisses Abhay, the soundtrack disappears. Tranquility expresses both the awkwardness and the tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The poignant end is a sweet and bitter film whose memories will last a long time. <br /> <br /> To see absolutely, I will note 8.5 / 10
