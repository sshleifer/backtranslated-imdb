This is just as good as the original 101 if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behavior and outfits, and the movie was probably shot because the audience wanted to see more Cruella. We see it a lot more this time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the rather clumsy leader. Using Paris as the highlight of the movie was a smart idea. The movie is worth watching regardless of your age, as long as you love animals.
