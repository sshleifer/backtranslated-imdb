I want to see this for a very long time, James Merendino is an excellent director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie, I thought it was an excellent follow-up. The game and the staging were great. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to flow except for the script. Sometimes the only thing that caught my attention was the fact that in distribution was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good, but I was expecting more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Look for the superb cameos of Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
