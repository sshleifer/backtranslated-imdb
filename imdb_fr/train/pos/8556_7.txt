This movie is just fun. I have nothing to do with the America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another try, but better than Band Camp and The Naked Miles, at least funnier. Right after the first five minutes, I was laughing at myself. So I decided to call my friend to watch him together. We had a few beers and had a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> You will not find a deep message in this movie, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> So, lie down and enjoy.
