I really liked AWTWB from Tom Barman. You just have to let it come on you and enjoy it while it lasts, and expect nothing. It's like sitting on a coffee terrace with a beer in the summer sun and watching people go by. This will certainly not prevent you from thinking afterwards, that's right, but it's not a prerequisite for a good movie. The experience during the film is excellent. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that some aspects could have been worked a bit more, but being a fan of Lynch, I do not care much anymore :) <br /> </ br> > And I * liked * the style or style of this movie. It's smooth, but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music lover will have his talent for AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I will give him 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (Musically 10 out of 10)
