Vanilla Sky is a remake of the movie Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) of 1997. And in my opinion, a much more humane and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egotist who takes for granted the emotions of others and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best friend and, in many ways, his only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional companion in bed. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All their interactions and their consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will no longer explain the plot because it is much more convincing, the less you know about it. Ignore all the people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
