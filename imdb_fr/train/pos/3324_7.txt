Someone has mastered the difficult task of merging sport with romance. In reality, sport and romance go hand in hand with oil and water. So, to put both together on the screen ... well, it's about the equivalent of splitting the atom. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that in general I do not like romantic comedies ... but I like sport and most sports movies. This film was a very good mix of both. Being a baseball fan, I could really enjoy the humorous ordeal with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) as a mad fan of Boston Redsox. Everyone who knows baseball knows the Curse of the Babe who hit the Redsox for 86 years, and they know how much the baseball of many Redsox fans is crazy. The Farrely brothers did a great job capturing that and it was a good comedy. It was a very good movie that could please a lot.
