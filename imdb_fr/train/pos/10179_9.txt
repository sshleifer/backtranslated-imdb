De Grot is a very good movie. The big plot comes from Tim Krabbé's novel, which also adapted this story to the screen. Some really high-end actors, not only Van Huêt, but especially Marcel Hensema, who worked mainly on television before his performance of Axel van de Graaf. The film seems to be a thriller and creates an excellent atmosphere. We then begin to learn more about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed little by little in a very convincing backtracking structure, which adds to the more romantic look and drama of the character. In the end, all of this leads to an emotional end, which will grab the audience by the throat. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you go to see this movie. A must, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (original screen adaptation of The Vanishing).
