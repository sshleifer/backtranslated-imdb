This movie is amazing! While being funny and entertaining, it is also deeply profound and revealing. I will watch again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but that's not what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and irritated by the fact that his life is not the way he should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything he thinks is wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has ever wanted. His life is ultimately exactly what he planned to do to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of winning everything, he loses the only person who really loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that was to happen in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was really there. This film was inspiring and profound. If you are really careful, it forces you to look at your life with a deep respect for the fact that we are often more blessed than we recognize it. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble addition, "Do not lose ourselves and those who matter, while we try to find out."
