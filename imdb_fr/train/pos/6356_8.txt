I thought that The Grinch Stole Christmas was a very good movie. It was not awful nor awesome, but it was nice to watch. I felt like Jim Carrey was a little boring from time to time. He gave Grinch the impression of a specialized educator, while all that he needed was devilish and sneaky, but he turned out to be somehow retarded. I thought the landscape, when it was not in Grinch's Grotto, was beautiful and there were some places where I laughed. but most of the time, I thought it was just boring. This film could have been "SO MUCH" better if it had changed Grinch's personality and included some extra laughter scenes, as most of his moods were not funny. I liked how the Grinch stole Christmas anyway, but it's not something to be excited to see.
