In general, I do not like reality shows, especially those that benefit from the success of "American Idol". But this one I can live with. <br /> <br /> Actors from around the world perform a brief routine for star talent scouts, and if they like them, they will be sent out to perform a routine for a real audience. Then, ten or twelve comics are selected to live together in a house and make "Survivor" style competitions using comic tactics. Then we will be determined as "Last Comic Standing." I like standing comedy, so this is the only reality TV show to consider my interests. There are usually pretty funny comics selected through. It started the career of talents such as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticisms are the fact that it is possible that many of these comics have been selected for their contribution to reality. show the drama. At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they got rid of it, thank God. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of comedians who, in my opinion, were chosen only because they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex etc., while other comics clearly had to beat them. But all in all, it's a well-done reality TV show, which are two terms so far, I thought was an oxymoron.
