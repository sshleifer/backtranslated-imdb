Melvyn Douglas gives once again a refined performance in which, this time, he embodies the role of a detective who can not place love before duty and adventure, and the warm beautiful Joan Blondell (who, far away to be illiterate, suggested a critic, wrote a novel about his childhood) is as pleasant as ever as his loving suffering.This is almost a ball comedy, almost a Thin Man type movie, almost a series, I guess, that did not really succeed a sequel. It does not quite reach the classic status, but it contains all the ingredients to spend 85 minutes fun with an episodic but rhythmic scenario, talented actors and a direction that makes everything happen fast enough that you do not notice almost not Williams. (Douglas) is not exactly Columbo when it comes to detecting. I wish there were more films like this one.
