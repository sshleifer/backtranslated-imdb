Fear this one in the column of victories, it was a superb film. The acting performances were excellent and the screenplay was just as great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was as gorgeous as Riverside Police Officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a police novice at the Riverside Police Department. She had an affair with a colleague she would have known she would have had a wife and children, while she undertook the dangerous task of getting undercover to catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta looks alike) did an amazing job as a confused, often stammering policeman, who had an affair with Gina. He was stoical as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it came to managing his feelings and his extra-marital affair. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, notably from the sitcom "Wings", did a good job as a discreet, gentle, insufficient sociopath. On the surface, he was an innocent loser, but beneath the surface lay a cold-hearted killer. Weber really took the personality of a childish young adult with an insatiable thirst for killing young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Each scene, each verbal exchange teaches us more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job of condensing the number of days, or even weeks, into a 90-minute film. This film was a good example of doing a lot with little.
