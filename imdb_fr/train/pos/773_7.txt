I was expecting something different: more passion, drama ... Again, a missed attempt at originality. I'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old clich√© of "cheesiness". not very convincing and the common lines, without any spirit. The soundtrack was good and well adapted. sinking into mediocrity.Then, to conclude, the production allows you to stay in front of the TV for nearly an hour and a half, which is a nice thing.
