I saw True Crime when it was released in the mid-90s and have watched it many times since. It's a big mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school girl from a California town whose younger sister was tortured and murdered by an unknown murderer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how bright she is and decides to work together to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects are included in this one. True crime seems to me very "real" or real. I read a group review where someone wrote that the total suspension of disbelief is here and it's so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, as do the other actors. The locations are accurate and author / director Pat Verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary wakes up from the dream sequence after viewing the photos she took Tony's). I would like Verducci to make more films. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other film like True Crime. 10/10
