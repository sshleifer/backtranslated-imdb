Reportedy based on real historical events, this troubling, violent, bloody and shocking epic maintains the viewer's interest by creating a likelihood in the majority of films taking place in a distant time. The representation of the rebel nun by Mrs. Bolkan is a tour de force. Her gradual transformation into an obedient complicit character if she does not want the social injustices of her time is clearly illustrated by eloquent sequences: her testimony of the occasional violent activity of the hated local duke, her forbidden love affair with a Jew, his criminal defection against the Muslim invader The forces of the sensual prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) This film contains painfully realistic sequences (human skinning) that are not for the naive, but the viewers with the hard stomach and the interests of the medieval history should know more. Deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to the Hollywood representations of the medieval world.
