Steve Carrel proves to be a great leader in this wonderful breath of fresh air, original and original. I got wet how great it was to be hilarious. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40 year old man who works in an electronics store. He's a bit of a nerdy guy who loves video games and comics and has the biggest collection. His peers who work in the store with him discover that he is a Virgo in a poker game rather based on a sexual dialogue, then Andy has to go through a funny Odyessy ethnic group of crude sexual revivals, but still in the process to ruin everything that leads him not losing his virginity, but he ends up getting lucky in the end. <br /> <br /> Let the little ones at home, but take the whole family to see this wonderful adult romantic comedy. From the beginning, you will be caught off guard and you will be afraid to wear your very thick absorbent underwear. The only thing I can say about it is that it's unfortunate that Steve Carrel was not recognized as a departing man 20 years ago. He will certainly win the best male performance at the MTV movie Awards in the coming years. You can bet your hard-earned dollar on it, people! <br /> <br /> I give this one a perfect 10!
