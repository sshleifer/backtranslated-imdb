It's a perfect series for family watching. We gather around the television to watch this on BBC America. This is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood that will appeal to kids and adults alike. Our teenager and teenager love to sit with mom and dad and watch Robin's next exploits. We can not wait for the next episode to air every week and we are happy to be able to watch for free "On Demand". <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a contemporary fashion touch. There is a moral to every story. It's entertaining. Violence is neither exaggerated nor useless. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with an impression of John William. It's an old tale that comes back to life with a new global flavor. <br /> <br /> There is so much nonsense on TV that goes from decaying brain to "reality TV" to senseless violence. You should take this for what it is and it's an updated "Robin Hood" that should not be compared to Errol Flynn's film exploits. It's a gem that everyone can enjoy. Parents who fear that their children will watch too much violence will appreciate the fact that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood who would rather try to reason to get out of a disagreement than to fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive model for young girls. Rather than remaining passive and doing nothing, she plays her own role in helping the poor by playing the role of "night light". The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously mean, just like the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by a very nice actor, an actor who makes most women wish he did not play the role of a bad "Guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Friar Tuck?"
