Bruce almighty, one of Carrey's best pictures since ... well ... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I've known for a long time as well ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even makes surprisingly fun jokes. It contains one or two romantic moments a bit boring but especially a great movie with fun scenes. The best scene is where Jim makes the voice of the anchor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
