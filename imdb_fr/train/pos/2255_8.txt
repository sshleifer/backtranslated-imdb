Not a bad martial arts movie. The fight scenes were good. Michel Qissi directed his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line of history that works. It would be nice to see something else of her in the same genre. She loves art and promoting strong women. It was really worth watching. I recommend the film to all lovers of drama and martial arts.
