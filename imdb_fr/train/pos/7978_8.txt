This film contains the only ingredient that all revenge movies should have, namely the real emotion. Grief, love, laugh, anger. There are so many emotions in this film. From beginning to end, this film is extremely captivating. The plot on paper looks like the hull that we throw most often in front of the public, but make no mistake, this film is powerful. Washington, as always, is performing well. <br /> <br /> The plot in summary: a man suffers from depression, a girl gives life, children are kidnapped, a man wants revenge. It does not look like anything special, but it is far superior to any other similar movie. For now, TAKEN is a similar movie, but when you compare the two, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are attractive and everyone plays a great performance and the staging is excellent. Mexico feels alive, it looks like Mexico, it smells like Mexico. Everything is described brilliantly. the style of realization was something that I appreciated and brought out the best in Mexico City. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies you go out once a year and you're going to beg family and friends to watch. From beginning to end, you look for the main protagonist, making it a roller coaster ride. There is enough action to keep you happy, there is enough character development to please you and then there is Washington to make you smile. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
