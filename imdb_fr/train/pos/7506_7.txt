I will not lie. Although it sounds interesting, I watched The Notorious Bettie Page because I had heard (and it was pretty obvious to watch a synopsis or anything of the film), that Gretchen Mol was naked . I have never been a fan of Mol, but I can not help but see a pretty woman undress. Yes, it can be perverse, but it is a theme and a central element at the very heart of the film, and helps make the film much stronger than it probably should be. <br /> <br /> The film tells the chronicles of Bettie Page (Mol) her life since her years of physical and sexual abuse as a child in South High School and in her new life in New York. She wants to be an actress, but she also has to pay her bills. After taking some seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, Page slowly becomes a dummy sensation and quickly switches from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs. <br /> <br /> I feel the film's brevity (just over 90 minutes) is both a curse and a blessing for her. On the one hand, the film never goes beyond its reception. You get to know Page in just a few minutes, then it goes straight into her modeling career and does not look back. But that also curses the film because we never really have the opportunity to catch everything that's going on. It jumps just a little between the models and the controversies they create before embarking directly on the major Senate inquiry that occupies much of the last act of the film. You sit and try to absorb everything, and more comes straight ahead. One has the impression that the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in a film too short. He asks for longer sequences, and asks for even more explanations. He does not feel in a hurry; <br /> <br /> The use of color throughout the film is a bit of a loophole, although it is a little more curious. The majority is in black and white, but frequently, splashes and color sequences appear. But although it was done early as a symbolic gesture, it becomes a bit of a distraction because it continually appears later before going back to black and white. This becomes confusing and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the movie moves on. <br /> <br /> Although he may fumble a bit with the actions, the film remains insensitive to his themes. Page, of which I know almost nothing, plays innocently and his world is exactly the same. With the exception of a few shady characters during her teenage years, every person she meets is an innocent, and all she does is innocent. I had never thought that I would consider frontal nudity as something other than vulgar and depraved, but here it is really something to admire. All at once, it's beautiful and innocent. Even the most perverse moments in the film (even if they are tamed by current standards) have a sense of innocence and angels. There is just something in the way Mol's naked body is described as striking a chord so different from that of naked bodies in other films. It seems so natural and wonderful that, if there was any reason to watch the movie, it would be to see Mol's spectacular depictions of her body as she plays Bettie Page. <br /> <br /> The other reason is Mol se. As a page, it is a good illustration of the beautiful 50's of the South that everyone knows (or can at least imagine). Despite her job, she is still a normal person and still considers herself a nun. Mol gives her exactly the degree of cleanliness she needs to give this character an authentic impression of the 1950s. She plays it with such obviousness that you'd be hard-pressed to believe that Mol was really Bettie Page herself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, secondary actors have very little time to shine, and are totally eclipsed by Mol's magnificent performance. None of them do anything particularly pleasant, and none of them really has the same strength in his role as Mol. It's not really the fault of the actors, but even more so because they do not have much to work with. Many of them are quite recognizable, such as David Strathairn (Oscar nominee) (in a role too close to one of his best performances), Sarah Paulson (recently named by the Golden Globes for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip) and Lili Taylor, but you would have a hard time placing their performance in a position other than that agreed. None of these characters are really developed, and they are really character cut-outs that Mol executes in a loop as she accelerates in her brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Really, this film is worth it for its interpretation. of nudity, and for the excellent performance of Bettie Page by Gretchen Mol. Everything else is a little too confusing and awkward as it should be. If more work had been done to develop supporting characters and not only in the story, this film would have been a much better biographical film. In the current state of things, it is a way for Mol to truly rise into the stratosphere of actor popularity. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
