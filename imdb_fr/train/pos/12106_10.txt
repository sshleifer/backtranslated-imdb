"Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" by Antonio Margheriti is a strange and atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts. It is absolutely beautiful in black and white and gives off an extremely frightening Gothic atmosphere. Alan Foster is an English journalist who is pursuing an interview. Edgar Allan Poe, visiting American horror writer, claims to Foster that he can not spend a night in the abandoned mansion of Thomas Blackwood, a friend of Poe.Accepting the bet, Foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins! The sequence of the crypt is really strange and the tension is almost unbearable.Barbara Steele is incredibly beautiful as a sinister ghost Elisabeth Blackwood. "Castle of Blood" is easily one of the best Italian horror films made in the early 60's. A masterpiece!
