dear god where should I begin. It's the best movie I've ever seen. the camera angles are excellent but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the writers of this film do not write big budget movies that I will never understand. another is the casting. that's great. This is Ted Raimi's best film. I know some of you probably think "not at all that he has much better" but not your fault. raptor island is a work of art. I hope this should have been the best movie of the year in place of this crashy movie Crash with a bunch of names and raptors. I think this movie is really the most wonderful thing of all time.
