Sentimental and naive but undeniably moving, emotional plea man-man-help, personified in this case as German and French miners forced to separate after the Great War because of a new frontier causing disillusionment on the German side, as the French are the bosses. But when a fire begins on the French side, the common decency of German men leads to assistance, security and even friendship. This is a plea that will fall on deaf ears during the decade, as a certain man on Pabst's side will break it and make the Great War a mere prelude. But it's obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism, while this film radiates this optimism while his more casual and cynical adaptation of The Threepenny Opera lacked the motivation to make this work works. . His sincere belief is also the fact that the characters here are not simplistic spokespersons for positions, but real people, with real families whose lives also inhabit us. These are ordinary men of the working class who believe that it is important to treat well and treat your neighbor, and on this day of individualist opportunism, I will clear up my plot to convey a positive message that represents a point of view to which, I think, we can all aspire. <br /> <br /> (Note: apparently, the end is cut off on most of the prints, where the French are rebuilding the mine gate, closing the men again, a sudden turn of events and perhaps of the movie a better film as a whole, but I would have regretted it by spoiling the positive waves of the final sequence, so in short, I'm glad it was cut.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (of 11) from 1931}
