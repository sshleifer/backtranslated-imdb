We must remember that the 50s were almost a blank sheet when it came to movies. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic, black, two-reel war movies, and so on. in movies with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, on the docks, etc. Some might think it was an improvement. I do not. Who was the mogul who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union. He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertaining than a distance therapy. <br /> <br /> It's a pip. These are three sisters who are trying to take control of their deceased father's estate. One of them, perhaps the only one worth exchanging, calls on the company's pilot to help keep the rest of the family at bay. He is initially in the shot for the dollars, but ends up falling for her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family tries to sabotage the romance. The results are predictable. You get a bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary madness - if there is such a thing. We never meet parents, but they really had to be fucked up. The cast is virtually unknown. One or two of the actors seem vaguely familiar. The acting is so hard to believe. It was released under the United Artists banner by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was shot in and around LA mainly at night and probably without a license. The end was so weird that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they were running out of money and the producer had decided to wrap it up in the middle of a stage. <br /> <br /> I can not explain it - not even for myself - but I gave this rubbish heap an 8/10. I know the term "it's so bad it's good", but I do not think I've ever encountered this phenomenon before. Well, maybe "Hot Rods to Hell", but this one fits perfectly. You might want to try this if you like movies that seem to have been made in someone's basement.
