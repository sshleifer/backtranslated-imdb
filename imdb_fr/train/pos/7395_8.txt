Almost all the film takes place in a public bath in China. There is no sophisticated decor, explosion or glamorous people - just fine writing, acting and staging (Hollywood, take note!). <br /> <br /> A separated son returns home when he believes his father is dying. He is surprised to see that Dad looks good and manages the family business as usual. In fact, he notices that his father and his delayed brother have really formed a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son comes from the big city and does not really see the value of the old public bath. The way their relationship changes and the plot goes on there is exceptional and credible. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see that not all Chinese movies are action movies (like those with Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), because I do not really care about these frantic movies. The shower and the spring in a small town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese movies on PEOPLE!
