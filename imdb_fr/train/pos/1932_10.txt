I think that I usually approach film festival comedies hoping that they will be invariably "weird" and that any humor will be derived solely to the detriment of the simplicity of the characters in a complex context. What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while regaining his humor full of laughter, scene after scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps also partly due to the hard work of the DP, which I rarely saw in an independent film, and even more rarely in a comedy. To note here: the tour of Paget Brewster as a math teacher Amy. After seeing this performance, I do not understand why Brewster was not "discovered" by a wider audience. It brings the necessary mixture of anger and sympathy to the role that really helps this image to reach its potential. It's a great job that deserves a wider audience. I'm expecting more from the director and the cast!
