Okay, I saw this movie when I was a child and I really liked it. My parents never bought me the movie, but I think I'll buy it now. I am a sucker for animated films before 2000. Anyway, on the current criticism. <br /> <br /> WHAT I WANT: There was a real representation of paradise and hell, one of the few that I saw in animated films. The development of character existed! It's easy to classify the characters in this movie (Charlie is cynical but Itchy is cynical but Charlie, Carface is obviously the ruthless villain, etc.). I also liked the song of King Gator. I have always liked noisy, annoying and flamboyant guys. This song may have been random, but it was so much fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was magnificent. You could see that Charlie was gruff and that the sets were beautiful. <br /> <br /> WHAT I WOULD NOT BE: The real representation of paradise: The way Charlie reacted, "no surprises", did it really seems very boring. He denied having a place in heaven and had to ALWAYS return to it at the end. I remember a few lines of some songs such as "... you can not keep a good dog", "... make music forever", and "... welcome to be dead" but I do not can not remember the majority of them. The songs were not so catchy, to be honest. Whippet Angel: She's annoying and that neck! AUGH! <br /> <br /> WHAT PARENTS COULD NOT LOVE: Some very frightening images (according to the viewer) of Hell are shown during the movie. Carface is quite threatening. Beer is also implied, but not really DUBBED beer. The game is a key element of the film. The good guy dies. <br /> <br /> TOGETHER: I LOVE this film, even if it is sometimes a little forgettable. The most scary children's animations are always my favorites. It was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to scare children from time to time. Nowadays, this would probably have been classified PG. Children under 8 years old (or easily disturbed children) should not look at this. Other than that, I give it 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Have a nice visit!
