In the previews, "The Virgin, 40" presents the image of another immature sexual parade about a lonely guy in his forties who suddenly feels the urgent need to commit this act simply because that he did not do it. Too many bad past experiences have dampened her enthusiasm to the point of completely avoiding women. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. In addition, there is a film about it entitled "The Virgin, 40 years old". <br /> <br /> The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is actually 40, works as an employee in an electronics store, he collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all over the world. along with his beautiful record of single, in the sight of all. He has a home theater system and is watching "Survivor" with his two elderly neighbors. It's a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who has to go out more and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now, here's the real novelty of this photo: it accomplishes the impossible task of dealing with its subject. in a cute and mature way. It is a film that could very easily have been made differently in the hands of a more transparent team of directors. It could have been endless gags and sexual jokes, but fortunately, this image never drops so low. Of course, there are jokes about sex here and there and even some incentives are aimed at the gay community (who are in no way supposed to be considered a homosexual), since two of the characters exchange insults while playing game video ("Mortal Kombat: Deception", nothing less - the ultimate fight against testosterone in guys). <br /> <br /> As someone who is fast approaching, collects action figures from McFarlane Toys AND has never done In fact, I found this film as fun and touching as ever a film about the same theme would not have been. I was able to identify with the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone else in the theater because I was the only teenager at this screening; everyone seemed to be 40 years old. A bit arrogant, I know, but would you (italicized) be able to tell if you were the only teenager at the screening of "The 40 Years Old" in the Virgin afternoon "? <br /> <br /> Of course, Andy never had sex and wakes up every day with" morning dawn "(does not ask for it), and his friends urge him to trying to get strange methods to attract the attention of the opposite sex.When it was discovered that Andy is a virgin, at age 40, his three pals and electronics shop colleagues, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) all assume he is gay because he has never been with a woman, which could not be further from the truth.The truth is that Andy loves women, but his traumatic experiences past (hilariously revealed one after the other in a flashback sequence) have permanently sidelined it. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal s each ship a mission to get Andy laid, so help them all. But you know that such breakaways will only end in disaster, as evidenced by an appointment with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who makes Andy the worst drunk driving experience I think all of world would not want to live and that it has a rather frightening encounter. with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and who ends up being a real demon of sex. <br /> <br /> Things come to life for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly woman who works in a shop across the street selling things on eBay to people. Hmmm. And with this nice collection of action figures, you can understand that in the end, a big financial gain awaits him, that is to say if he can ever "perform the act". <br /> <br /> Finally, this is the sex we expected. This deals with a very real problem that Lonely Guys probably encounters, not that the virgin is a problem, but look at the big picture: how many of us, the Lonely Guys, want to be a lonely man forever? The important thing in this picture is that Lonely Guy has to be himself. I do not think he should go on to body hair removal like Andy (which, to be honest, divides aside, and according to this website and various other news articles, was real, and the blood on the Carell's shirt next). <br /> <br /> "The Virgin of 40" was directed by Judd Apatow and was co-written by Carell and himself, originally as a skit starring Carell. Carell is sweet and human, because her character is not a layman who approaches this thing with her eyes closed. This is probably one of the most intelligent antics I have ever seen and is not offensive (a lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's friends, who give bad advice to hide their own insecurities in their relationships, can be linked to a fundamental level. <br /> <br /> The way "The Virgin of 40 years" is played is really fun the end, but I leave you to watch. Certainly, if everyone can do as Andy and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener, then it's true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
