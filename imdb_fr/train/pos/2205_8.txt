Your medium psychotic garden variety (deliciously tried out by Stephen Sachs) is taking away various dark-haired "young adults" (to use the term very vaguely) at the University of Dayton Hall, which is being demolished. Daphne Zuniga makes her ignominious movie debut and unsuitable here as Debbie, a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car!), A total of 10 cadavers corpses well made up by Matthew Mungle, some bloody murders (stick baton baseball, strangling chicken wire, your standard drill, that kind of horrible thing), sadly surprised ending that was later copied into "Intruder", a scary Christopher ("Hellraiser") Young score, a slight hint of nudity free feminine and incredibly incompetent direction of Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this fun abysmal slice'n'dice atrocity presents itself as a dash of deliciously dopey delight and low-grade drecky.
