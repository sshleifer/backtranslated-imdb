The "sexploitation" of children is one of the most serious problems facing our world today and I feared that any film on the subject would go directly to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature to shock and disturb the public. After seeing "Trade" and "Holly", a film pushed me to really want to see a change in international law. The other had the impression of a poor attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and a strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not think it is useful or necessary to adopt this strategy to turn this issue into a hollywood in Hollywood and I have to congratulate the "Holly" brands for engaging in a subtle way but powerful in the terrible conditions in which these children live are unfortunately forced to bear. The "trade" oscillated between serious and stupid with scenes depicting the death of a cat that came after images that depicted children forced to commit horrible acts. I found it uncomfortable and sometimes offensive to the cause. If I had wanted to laugh cheap, I would not have signed for a movie about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For those who would like to watch a powerful movie that really means something, I would advise you to save on the movie ticket for the release of "Holly".
