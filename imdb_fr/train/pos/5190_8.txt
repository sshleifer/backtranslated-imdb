The pros of this movie are the amazing fighting scenes - absolutely incredible sword shots and a martial art show. A true masterpiece of John Woo. The story tends to last a bit, though, but it never conceals the collapse of the acrobatic action of the martial arts. If you like martial arts movies, you'll love this one!
