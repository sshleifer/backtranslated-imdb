I do not know what it is with this movie. But movies about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course, it's not 100% accurate. It's hard to make 100% accurate movies nowadays when even "experts" disagree. That's why I'd rather judge a movie by what it's trying to say than break all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start by saying that I liked this mini-series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years passed too fast. The series should have been a story in three parts, his childhood being the first part. But if they did not have more money to shoot more stories, who should I criticize? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem with this film and it is the fact that it is told in a book story. Especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened. I would have rather liked to see Hitler more human (more scenes where he suspects, etc.). Noah Taylor did it more in the movie 'Max', which seems to work better, I think. Nevertheless, I am happy that this has been done and that I have it on DVD. Just to remind me more clearly what happened and see Carlyle do her best. 7.5 / 10
