Excellent ground in a field in a field. Too bad that two of my movie heroes have a good hug. Must be my education :) <br /> <br /> Very well played by all. You never know who will do what. The last touch at the end allows everyone to get their just dessert. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone. A harmless thriller with clenched fists that, if it has faults, is probably Michael Caine's excessive use of the word "bloody", but that's his signature, is not it? <br /> <br /> 9/10
