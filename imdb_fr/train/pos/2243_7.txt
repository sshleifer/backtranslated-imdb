I thought the whole movie was going great with cool pictures and interesting cinematography all the way through. The actors were on the back of their character in almost perfect timing and looked great. The music was lush and well thought out. There was even a decent end. So what is everyone voting against? The story was not quite fresh (it looked like a remnant of "Running Man" with the idea of ​​a TV show), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the audience chose their Messiah certainly seemed quite true. It made sense to follow this man who was presented in front of a modern crowd and place him on a pedestal because of the opportunity that is offered to him. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religious people decide because the film has the word "God", but it shows what the filmmakers were trying to do was to teach a possibility to people who may never have seen the world in this way, especially in the modern world where Christianity is increasingly accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave him 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought that every ounce of the film was entertaining and original, for the most part. Check if you are not too offended to see an entertaining film from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the next modern Messiah on TV near you.
