This version made for the television version of the legendary tribune against all hope desperate is more objective, more realistic than the previous filmed versions of the events, although the film made after that may have been too far in humanizing the characters of Sam Houston , Bowie, Travis and Crockett. <br /> <br /> The focus is on Jim Bowie, played with a cynical detachment of James Arness, apparently still alive at age 85. Then, at age 65, he returned to action after years away from the screen to do this part. <br /> <br /> Raul Julia, born in Puerto Rico, does not humanize General Santa Ana as a person since the beginning of J. Carol Naish in 54. However, the Mexican dictator is described as a popinjay populjay - lush and voluptuous - no uniform has ever been seen before. He receives excellent advice from the European officers he has hired but, convinced of his own infallibility, he pays no attention. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age is adapted to the character he plays: Col William Travis. His performance is serious. He is almost impressed by the older men who share command with him. <br /> <br /> The only word that was shocking was Brian Keith in Crockett. Wearing a cap over the shoulder and wearing Ol 'Betsy, he stumbles as if he had just released another film. In the absence of conviction in the representation, the character is reduced to a few conventions of scene. <br /> <br /> The script reveals some historical facts overlooked or removed in previous versions of the film. We learn that Jim Bowie, in the person of Santa Ana, was fighting his own brother-in-law. The Mexican soldiers had poor results, in part because they were armed with guns left by the Napoleonic wars a generation earlier. "Santa Ana loves bargains." Bowie explains with irony. The defense project of the former Spanish mission as a fort was not recommended militarily - a fact that was deepened in the 2004 film "The Alamo".
