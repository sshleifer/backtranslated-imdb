A house horror well executed, old and very dark. A good montage that includes the character of Poe, himself, alluding to the story in a London pub. Although from there, it's pretty much the guy who dared to visit the house one night in particular, whether to watch or to avoid people, it's still the most enjoyable. Plus, we have the delicious and enigmatic Barbara Steele. There are wooden dialogues and snatches and unexplained things, but it is the super-scary atmosphere that is maintained throughout it, as well as the superb musical score that allows it to continue to moving forward. The DVD comes from the United States and has some extras.
