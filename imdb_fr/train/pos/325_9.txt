It's an excellent film, especially if you compare it to the sometimes tiring seriousness of politically-minded directors. A film that can so easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity nowadays. Although the buoyant optimism of the 1960s can not be found, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the energy and charm of the film. I do not know what the movie's "boring" writers were watching - they're so excited that there's never the same movie over 15 minutes at a time.
