I come from Romania, I will try to speak in English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my number one of all time. Seen above at least 30 times and will see it for many years now. He has all the little things I like in a movie, it's very touching, it makes me cry. Show a lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality, and the real things that matter to different people. It turns out that for me, that's what matters most, the love, the soul of a man, his inner being, and that's what I see in this film. For me, it may be much more than a film, it's irrefutable proof that it can really exist and that you make the most of every moment you live with your soul mate. It's far from reality to science fiction, but ... and so. And if all capitalism disappears and the economy collapses, would it fall? We would all be concerned about other issues and I think that on your deathbed, the most important thing you will remember is not the wealth, the adventure, the countries you visited, or people who remember you. But true friends and your true love and hope that after your death, everything will be perfect and that people will be good and will care more. WATCH THIS FILM and it will probably guide you in your life as it did to me :) Hello from Romania
