I do not care if you want my comment or not, but I think you who write that the film is not good, you are so obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can not see how it is good. movie I'm not a fan of Jay Chou but I like his piece and not just his ... and you may think that there is not much sense in this idea and you may think that it is not so interesting but look at it deeply It's more than action in movies more than love, passion and tears, there is more than the United States in the world and that's good :) really good. And it's expensive, so do not criticize the actors, the directors, because you do not know how hard they work so that you're happy watching them, thank you :)
