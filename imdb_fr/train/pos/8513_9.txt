I always had the philosophy that every human being had different tastes, I found this film awesome and I think that all students could agree with me. Despite this, it's not a "movie with a plot", it's about real guys and some of the "problems" they face. I found the film hilarious (especially the roles in which they played jokes). In simple terms, if you are in the same "wavelength" as these people, you will find this amazing movie. I do not think it will win Golden Globes or Oscars, or that people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars, but it is a kind of "cult classic" among young people who could tell their experience . For me, the guy who stands out the most is Hans: the Scandinavian, who, according to him, "is not a spectator", but receives all (or some) girls. "Little people" also play an important role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I could provide a spoiler and I do not want to do it, just go get the movie and you will not regret it. I give him an 8/10
