Yes, it's another great Muppet magic movie and I love them all; characters, movies, episodes of TV shows (it's the best humorous or musical TV show to date) and all the artists hiding behind. But here they made a fatal mistake so rare and I'm probably talking about the bizarre end !! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to involve so much in the American drama and end a love story through marriage !! We, like all poor viewers, feel so free or perhaps happy from the absence of its annoyance, its sullen character and its misery! So, we all love these stories that bring together two cute heroes in love couples with no legitimate connection, like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So with all the previous couples and their ilk, I bet you feel safe, serenity and peace. Therefore, when you look at what the directors of this movie have done, you will be as angry as me! <br /> <br /> They forced the weak and miserable creature (Kermit) to marry her daily nightmare, the most vexatious woman ever (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change to the extent of the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal to have a negative impact on the public who refused to bless or believe or be satisfied with this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or the appropriate opportunity to think or decide anything!). It is not surprising that you know that this film is the biggest failure in its cinematographic genre, yielding only 25 million against 65 million for the first (The Muppet Movie 1979) five years earlier! <br /> <br /> Just in this movie, they took Manhattan, and my rest too!
