It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan ended up. He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in his fifties and one could expect a slowdown. But with "Rush Hour 3", where he passes behind Chris Tucker (of everyone!), Then there is "Kung Fu Panda" where he not only plays a purely vocal role, but his character has almost no dialogue . .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a huge understatement. <br /> <br /> This is sometimes the case when the only solution is to take out an old dusty VHS tape and watch Jackie smash asses in his junior, editor, days without Chris Tucker. <br /> <br /> Enter "Police History". Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a police officer charged with protecting a witness before a major trial. He faces the resistance of the uncooperative witness and the many gunmen sent by the crowd to silence both of them. <br /> <br /> But, on the contrary, who cares? We do not watch Jackie Chan's films for the story. We watch them see Jackie Chan doing spectacular stunts and generally hitting and hitting a lot of people who are less impressive than him. <br /> <br /> And at this level, "Police Story" does not make him disappoint at all. In the end, there's a showdown at a shopping mall that peaks as Jackie glides along a giant high-voltage chandelier. Seriously, if this kind of thing happened more often, no man would need to be persuaded to shop for clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also comedy, which often implies that Kar-kui inadvertently upsets May (Maggie Cheung), his girlfriend who suffers forever and always seems to forgive. The humor is on the whole rather discreet, but it works, so I do not complain. <br /> <br /> The acting game is not too subtle either. Indeed, I am not sure that there was something subtle in "Police Story". Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does it too) clearly understands why we watch his films and knows that while waiting for the next fight, the last thing we want is to look for nuances and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So, "Police Story" is an explosion. As is the case with most of his films, Jackie's realization of what you see on the screen puts him above the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan is really hanging on a bus that is running at full speed through an umbrella, a brand new "Wow!" factor is added to the action.
