It's different from all the other movies. The closest thing I can compare is a Woody Allen movie ... But where Woody Allen is constantly looking for human weaknesses, Bret Carr seems to be trying to find a way to tackle it. disabling insecurity that tends to define us for better or for worse. In Lou's case, this is the root cause of his stuttering, which can be attributed to a singular child trauma that is revealed through backtracking. <br /> <br /> There are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and I think they all deserve a chance for redemption, although the diversity of human traits is, after all, what makes the world so intriguing, so maybe we should not fix our neurosis more than we should repair our nose or our chest. <br /> <br /> This is an independent film shot over long distances, but the production values ​​are huge, as is the scope of the film. I feel like an unusual jewel for the mutual aid market. I can not wait to see what this filmmaker will do next. I could imagine a Woody Allen or Albert Brooks-style career, even though generally, when a guy like this comes up, he goes away and does "X MEN" and his humble quirky. the origins are quickly forgotten or are they .... X Men is a group of monsters if I remember well :)
