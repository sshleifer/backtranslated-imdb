The intellect of the plot is about as light as the pen. But the advantage here is the classic refusal of boys and girls we are used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and that "Top Hat" is now missing. The dance duo is made up of former lovers Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who have always been in love since their dance days. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a musical of the 30s, there are problems of The misunderstood romance, the chic court and the slight irritation of a sabotaged hearing with baking soda have cost Ginger something quite special. And then, in the great tradition of diminishing finances, nothing beats the best Hollywood artists to put on a show. <br /> <br /> Attractive numbers from Irving Berlin are scattered throughout the show. Hats and evening dresses are kept until the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are out again to charm the world ... and the navy. Everyone and everything is so nice again. <br /> <br /> Pure classic nonsense at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we only know that it must work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
