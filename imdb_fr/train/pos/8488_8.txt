I just have to put my two sous. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, most of the time, the characters are written and interpreted in a broad way. I can not think of a lot of comedies where they are not. This is not a new version, it is in video and broadcast on the cable almost every week. Would I see him in a theater? Of course, I did it, when he came out. It's funny ... it should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even though I did not like it at all, I would still watch him on the cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underrated and underrated actor. I can not think of another who is so capable in all genres. I can not think of someone who is so successful. A comic actor who is also an action star (short-lived but still), who is also a romantic lead role, who is also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. I can not think of any, at least in Hollywood. Certainly no one who has succeeded in all these genres. I mean, there's Tom Cruise, but for me it's better to be Tom Cruise than to become a character. However, as it is not Michael Keaton against Tom Cruise, I move on to something else. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth renting. Wal-Mart. It's worth watching the cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of those fun to watch movies. You can pause your brain and relax, then laugh. <br /> <br /> To ask more, in my honest opinion, is asking too much.
