It's a wonderful film in many ways. Everyone in my family appreciated. The animation is excellent and shows that there are many producers who create films as brilliant as anything from the Disney studio. <br /> <br /> The Dreamworks film differs from the normal price by its price. does not involve a crackling side kick to relieve comedy. And, there are no sudden moments when the characters begin to sing. I'm sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a Disney picture: the birth of the Spirit. But this is done with taste and is not offensive at all. "Spirit" was a big breath of fresh air. Do not mistake yourself. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of great animation. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to watch it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
