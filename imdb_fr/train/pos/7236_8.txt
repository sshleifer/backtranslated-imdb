This film is available from David Shepard and Kino on the Avant Hollywood film, Fort Lee, New Jersey, although it is an abbreviated version containing only "behind-the-scenes footage". I do not know if Blackhawk Films had a movie The original version of Blackhawk was renamed A Movie Romance. The full functionality is preserved, but the pre-printing of this version involved a nitrate decomposition and some sections seemed bad, so that may be why the version of Blackhawk was changed. <br /> <br /> Directed by Maurice Tourneur, the film makes Turner play himself, or more likely a caricature of himself. Supposedly, director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg can also be spotted. <br /> <br /> Mary (Doris Kenyon), a young girl from the country who wants to let her down by a romantic man, she dreams of a troubadour who will seduce her, but she is constantly interrupted by the only local boy available, Johnny Applebloom. <br /> <br /> Meanw Hile, a film company from New York (New Jersey) is filming a western in the country. Mary sees an Indian (in full hairdressing) and raises an alarm - spoiling a scene that the film company films. She is immediately attracted by the brilliant star of the movie Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He encourages her to leave home and become an actress in the big city. <br /> <br /> When she arrives at the studio, she discovers that everything about the cinema is wrong. The doors and walls are just hastily assembled apartments for the decor. This lanky walk of the western hero or the happy captain of the heroine are only acts. The sets are on a large rotating stage, so that the angle of the sun can even be manipulated. The black guardian of the studio signs all the "autographed" photos of movie stars. The signs on the wall say "Positively No Smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even the titles of the film (which are well illustrated) highlight all that is wrong in the cinematographic life. <br /> <br /> The movie star Driscoll is just as disillusioned with the hustle and bustle of making everyday movies. He makes a temporary split of his girlfriend Vivian (June Elvidge) to continue this exciting "peasant". Her plans are disappointed when Mary's screen test is a whore. We do not see the film itself, but only the painful reactions of the audience. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but she does not want to admit to everyone at home that she has failed. She continues to see Driscoll and we have lunch with him in the cafeteria of the studio with other extras disguised as police, soldiers, cowboys, etc. <br /> <br /> Mary decides to stay with Driscoll. At a party with their "friends" at the movies, she agrees to marry her although there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, her mother appears, with a cake specially for Mary's birthday. This led Mary to reassess her future. <br /> <br /> This film contains all kinds of fascinating scenes from workshops, movie sets, locker rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you've always wondered what was happening behind the scenes where a silent movie was made, this movie takes a look behind the curtain.
