Sammi, Curr a rock metal god, they tried to stop him, they tried to ban him, they tried to censor his music !! (a bit like real life Dee Snider, Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Killed in a fire, Sammi Cure was supposed to play Halloween in his old high school for a dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan, and the only one who knew how was Sammi and what he was feeling (or did he?) Nuke, the local radio DJ (Gene Simmons), gave and only gave Sammi Eddie's last record. But when Eddie tries to read the disc upside down, he finds Sammi talking to him from the dead and tells him what to do Back to the tyrants of his school who hate him, he and his music .. Everything happens well until Sammi starts killing !! A must-see movie for fans of heavy metal bands, with a great Fastway soundtrack, and just in case you do not know how the songs sound or know Fastway and do not like them, they've changed a bit de and his style also resembles that of Cinderella, or Ratt, better known. Is the film a real horror film? It depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror movie is a slasher, with a lot of murders, or just be scary .. This movie is neither, nor enough dead, but one action, comedy, drama, thriller or thriller, that's why I guess it's a horror .. So, if you want "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin at mid-night, your soul !!" Than Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat are for you. I mean "what are you afraid of?" It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?! "
