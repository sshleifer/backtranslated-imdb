Dramatic drama, William Mastrosimone's script based on his play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in her car by the rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to escape but the police inform her that they can not do anything. She realizes however that Joe has had his wallet and knows where she lives. When roommates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are at work, Joe visits him to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates and degrades her in various ways, she has the opportunity to hit him and imprison him. Knowing very well that she is in another situation "her word against yours" and that there is technically no rape, she has no intention of calming him down before he confesses to Pat and Terry what were his intentions. <br /> <br /> The film is finally a confrontation between his two opponents. As Marjorie shows such mercilessness, one has to wonder if she has become as crazy as her mortal enemy. Fawcett does a pretty good job, while Russo is really good as a depraved pretentious who does his best to handle the situation. With only two characters on the screen during most of the film, the film has an intimate character, suggesting that it would work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young does not fear the ugliest and most exploitative elements of the situation; the film sometimes becomes uncomfortable to watch. And when Marjorie gets the upper hand, things change enough so that it does not become so easy to encourage her to look for blood, and we hope Pat will show her the reason. <br /> <br /> "Extremities", I felt it was a very good film that kept at least its interest and intensity. Both Woodard and Scarwid have good support (Scarwid lives a big time when Terry turns out to be a rape victim) and the pace is constant. Admittedly, the dialogue is not always very precise, but the material is convincing at every step. <br /> <br /> 8/10
