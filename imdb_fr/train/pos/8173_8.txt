The point of this film is that even a competent dentist is very scared. This is one of man's primordial fears. This film is the nightmarish image that every child has to cross in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly dull performance as a crazy dentist who, I guess, tries to kill people, but he only works on their teeth, so it does not really work. In a particularly bloody scene, Earl Boen, a serious actor, has his teeth completely destroyed with the help of drills, etc. This is a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written but it's gore. The plot is of poor quality and sometimes seems to be invented on the spot, but hey, it's a dentist killer movie, we all thought about it but they did it first.
