A classic and influential little budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the career of director Carpenter and star Curtis. <br /> <br /> A seemingly unstoppable murderer, escapes from a psychiatric facility and returns to his hometown where he begins to hunt down a local babysitter for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a masterpiece of horror! The scary story and clever direction of Carpenter give this movie a life so cold that you have to see it to really feel! The management often consists of simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaky doors, which makes even the daily decor of a small town district really scary. Carpenter does well with his suspense and bumpy shocks to make them as scary as possible. It's a feat in itself that few horror filmmakers do! Moreover, he is wise enough to give us really nice young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the stronger. The greatest congratulations also go to the simple but terribly annoying music score of Carpenter. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> The distribution is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis has a great time as a charming babysitter Laurie Strode. She is so good that she would continue to play in a number of other horror films before embarking on larger films. The great Donald Pleasants performs a perfect performance as Myer's doctor, who is desperate to capture him again. Supporting actors such as Loomis, Soles, Castle and others is also a good thing. <br /> <br /> So, like his own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and relax. It's a MUST for all genre fans! <br /> <br /> **** on ****
