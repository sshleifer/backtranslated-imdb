The story of a wanderer, his sheep ranch boss and his daughter is not for everyone's taste, but it's still very intriguing. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, among the landscapes we know so well thanks to other films from this region. <br /> <br /> This film was the first time I saw the excellent Mary Regan, and I've been a fan ever since. The cast also includes Bruno Lawrence, whose American film "Smash Palace" probably remembers best. Terence Cooper takes a ride as a rancher who pays a little too much attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> Suddenly acted, with unforgettable performances that break all its tracks. I saw this film for the first time in an extremely modified form on television late at night here in America, but believe me, the unedited version is not to be missed.
