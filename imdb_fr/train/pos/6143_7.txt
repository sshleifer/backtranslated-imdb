Never seen this movie of 1971 and very amused by this superb production created by the studios Walt Disney and superb animations creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played a prominent role as a woman who took a witchcraft class. She was an apprentice who was starting to fly on a broom and had some trouble getting off the ground. Eglantine has discovered many tips and has been able to travel in her bed in different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her final exam to become an accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold this witchcraft class to Eglantine and he tries to help him in any way possible to find his solution. Eglantine has a purpose in her madness: to prevent the Nazis from avoiding England. Excellent family entertainment and we need more movies like this today.
