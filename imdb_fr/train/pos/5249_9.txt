The choice to make this SNL skit a movie was much better thought than other recent ones. The humor involved in the character is not an annoying humor, but it is also sufficiently motivated by the character to be extended for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> Curiously, sexual content seemed to be avoided, but it can be because the constraints of live television have taught me not to wait for it. I guess I thought more about "Leisure Suit Larry" risky than the producers ... <br /> <br /> Definitely not a PG-13 movie, which will probably hurt him to have reached the top of his predecessors more powerful, but still a better premise and a better writing than his saddest ones. <br /> <br /> I loved it, but I doubt it will be a resounding success ... that bothers me with all the frequency that other SNL alumni tend to)
