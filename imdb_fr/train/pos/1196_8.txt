I had watched the film for several days that summer, the final result was just two scenes from the film. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the cart, stop the cart, etc. So, this Dakota youth was eager to see the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was being picked, so the shooting scenes were real. (yes Doris, animals were injured during the shoot) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? An excellent western / social commentary from the 50s. This should be in the same class as High Noon for the real Western drama or be used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was addressed to the youth of the fifties.
