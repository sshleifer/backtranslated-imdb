When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh, no, it's as old as Elfen Lied and not even bloody!" And indeed, the configuration is almost identical, the young single boy living in a big house all alone, then suddenly engaging in a fantastic adventure while young sexy girls come to live with him. <br /> <br /> But this is where the resemblance stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as Inuiyasha's, while childish remarks and behavior are very rare. The magical configuration is a little old-fashioned because it is about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all the servants being a famous person, half of all the masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. fades and fades from the beauty of the drawing and the scenario. <br /> <br /> I watched the 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it to the anime that I liked the most, but which were other genres, must say that I was very happy.
