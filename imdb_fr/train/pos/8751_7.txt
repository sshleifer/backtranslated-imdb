Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, go to Thailand for a last experience before separating and going to college. It sounds like a fun time to visit an exotic land, until they meet an attractive stranger who makes them go on a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage. They are arrested by the local police and discover that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is the main story of "Brokedown Palace" and it's a good script. The film does a decent job in describing the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of Third World countries. In reality, the representation was rather mild, the conditions of detention being often much worse than those described. It reminds us that, no matter how bad our justice system is, it is blank about a large part of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film contains too many artificial situations. this has hindered the story. The whole escape attempt was spooky. Thinking that friends would be able to spend money for a bribe in the prison with a padded bra, without being discovered by the guards who systematically checked everything that came from the visitors, supposes that the guards or the spectators are fools. <br /> <br /> The story has not solved the persistent problem of drugs in Alice's backpack (Claire Danes). Did she really agree to carry the drugs? We are left to guess. It was intriguing to continue to guess the innocence of the girls throughout the film, but we ended the film without really knowing if one or both girls could be guilty. Apart from this considerable gap, the end was excellent and the results unexpected. <br /> <br /> The action of Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done. Danes, who has been oversold and exceeded, has arrived as an actor in this film. Although her performance was often immature (just like her character), she improved as the film progressed and circumstances became more dramatic. Beckinsale, on the other hand, goes under the radar throughout her brief career and shines like a follower of two shoes that suddenly finds herself in prison. This is the best performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman's lawyer has been misinterpreted. His sneaky and timid style is an asset in films like "While you slept," but as a lawyer in a third world crusading country to free two innocent girls from injustice, he was mistaken for personality. <br /> <br /> The sight of tourists on Thailand was interesting, but it did not make me want to leave. <br /> <br /> Overall, an entertaining film has been rendered improbable in part by the inclusion of ridiculous scenes. I gave him a 7/10.
