I was happy with the cast of famous players. The story is one of defending a cause, even if you run a personal risk. At a time when violence and pain are often at the forefront of the film, this film focuses on the good old cop. Although similar plots have been made many times, these guys are doing well. Relax and enjoy. Dennehy is a master of a film cover.
