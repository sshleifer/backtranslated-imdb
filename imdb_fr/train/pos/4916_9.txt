The plague replaces the femme fatale in this very suspenseful black film shot in New Orleans by director Elia Kazan. Kazan receives as always good performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for the claustrophobic thriller with a combination of narrow compositions and beautiful chase scenes in one shot. <br /> <br /> A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game. It turns out that it has a form of bubonic plague, so it is crucial not only to stop the killers, but also to vaccinate all those who have been in contact. Municipal and health authorities are implementing a secrecy plan rather than alerting the community for fear that the guilty are fleeing the city and spreading the disease. A detective and an epidemiologist against the clock form an uncomfortable alliance as they paint the waterfront using their contrasting investigation styles. <br /> <br /> Streets raises a huge ethical question about the public's right to know, the licensed physician pleading for a media blackout, creating a higher risk for the community. Whatever the outcome, you always risk having to guess the actions of the protagonist of the film. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark as Dr.Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren show courtesy and respect each other in their search for killers. Barbera Bel Geddis, Reed's wife, enjoys good times with Widmark in national scenes that bring a just touch of relief (more than comical) tensions of desperate search in the sinister surroundings of the New Waterfront. -Orl√©ans impressed by the director of photography, Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel, as a small time criminal, is slimy and reprehensible, but sometimes compassionate. Walter Jack Palance as Blackie Skeleton (Black Death?) Is simply remarkable. With striking intensity, Palance dominates every scene in which he finds himself not only with a great threat, but also with disturbing charm. In addition, it displays a tremendous athleticism that allows for a more moving continuity, especially in the powerful final allegorical moments of the film. <br /> <br /> The panic in the streets is probably Kazan's best non-Brando film. It is full of tension, well paced and edited. His local environment gives an impression of exalted reality that gives Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the film scene. With Panic, he succeeds with confidence.
