The most satisfying element of "Dan in real life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Mary (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is wonderfully realistic. Oscar-winning Juliette Binoche's cast as Dan's love interest was a superb decision. she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, she has aged well! If this film was made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect movie for interested adults. A mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "fraternity package" formula: stupid girls, chauvinists and lousy jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is witty and has fun, smart laughs all the way through. While other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience, the jokes of "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and smarter, and involve reflection from the public. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious girl, the middle girl, is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to say whether it was a personal choice on his part or a choice of the director. In any case, his character is unrealistic and boring. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film and takes nothing away from the story. <br /> <br /> In total, "Dan in real life" is a great film, a fantastic escape. the redundancy of offensive and dumb comedies. The quality of the writing, the staging, the acting and (especially) the cinematograph is excellent. It's just a beautiful light comedy.
