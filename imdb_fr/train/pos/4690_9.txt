Twenty-five years ago, I presented this film in children's entomology classes and I still remember the excitement of the children. they were delighted! It's not just the termites that built and live in the "Clay Castles", but also other animals that use the mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra is fighting against a lizard on the screen while a colony of mongooses is watching. This is not only good for entomology courses, but also for teaching ecology, because there is much to be said about the interactions between termites and other organisms and the entire ecology of all organisms who live in and around mounds. <br /> <br /> I would like the film to be available on DVD in order to be able to see it again and show it to others.
