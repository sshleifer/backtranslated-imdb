I must say that I was impressed by the cinematography was incredible, the frames close to perfection and the way he created the tension around a subject that looks more like a terrible trouble is beyond being . <br /> <br /> The film is about two narrators, one seen, one invisible. They both try to explain the importance of a series of paintings that caused a scandal a long time ago. The film deals only with theories and explanations of points of view, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I must say. It is certainly a film that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes of play, the film still seems to be a complete work. Fantastic direction! I must say much better than Blood of the Poet, which, for some strange reason, reminds me a bit. <br /> <br /> I guess you can call it by the slang word "artsy". It's pretty much a whole lot of professional discussions on various amazing theories and visual effects, but the team and Ruiz have succeeded. At least for me. An amazing movie.
