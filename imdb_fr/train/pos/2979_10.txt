There is really nothing to say about this movie .... it's brutal, but fun. <br /> <br /> Sketch of the plot (From the BDIM) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), invent a new basketball game using the rules of baseball. When the game becomes a huge success, they form, with the help of a billionaire, the professional baseball league where everyone gets the same salary and where no team can change cities. The Coop & Remer team, the Milwaukee Beers, is the only one to oppose the important rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> The acting is very good because there are not many big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a really good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun moments in this movie that I can not name them all. It never really lets up, and they do not try to stage a cruddy drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The soundtrack. It's good. I particularly like "Take me on" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Very underrated. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a raw film, but extremely funny. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
