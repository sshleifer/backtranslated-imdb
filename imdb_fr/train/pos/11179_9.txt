"Pet Sematary" succeeds in two major situations. First of all, it's a scary horror movie. The ones that are just not being produced these days. Second, it's an emotional and intelligent movie. So if you're looking for chills, fears, goose bumps and visually stunning decors, quality acting, dialongs and macabre effects; it's the movie you're looking for. A classic now and really a must for any Horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably the best adaptation to any King novel. The events seem a little hasty compared to the novel, but that does not mean that this underrated film is not a complete achievement of Horror / Drama. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely recognized for its emotion and horror. The film reflects the same feeling, mainly because the development of the character is excellent and you can feel the love relationship between its members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not offer joy!), A tragic event changes the atmosphere of the film, it is now very dark. The film has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after the death of Gage, the film becomes sad, gray, terrifying. Composing with the loss of a baby is one thing that can ruin a family's entire life, and "Pet Sematary" proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind the animal seminar is more than a myth no one wants to live, but sadness and despair push an emotionally destroyed father to try his luck. Unfortunately, the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous meeting with the semantic pet legend turned out to be a tragedy, but this time it's something a lot worse. What will happen in the life of our family All American? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What about surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> Watch "Pet Sematary" to watch one of the most touching and moving horror films of recent times. You do not regret. The acting is very good although I did not dig the actor who represented the father. He did not seem troubled enough when the situations required him to despair. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby truly delivered a superb performance and worked perfectly as a loving and noble mother. Baby Gage was amazing even on her scary parts. *Thrill*. Overall, it's a classic all-time and a disturbing film that touches the deepest fears of people: the loss of someone you love, the death that comes to life and a sense of desperation. <br /> Something is: for sure ... I do not want to be buried, in a pet seminar !!
