A realistic portrayal of young love for college, but also for an older viewer like me. He has ups and downs and twists and made me shed a tear or two. We rarely see movies with black urban characters that might appeal to an older, non-black audience and show a more realistic portrayal of the lives of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This film takes place on a university campus and in a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are various friends, acquaintances and situations that affect them for better or for worse. A typical plot, some would say, but it was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself rooted for the survival of the couple's relationship, seeing my own past in their story. Moments of deep reflection and revelation have sprung from the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant film that I would recommend to young people who are at heart and in love or have already been in love. Super movie. I'm going to look for a copy to add to my movie collection.
