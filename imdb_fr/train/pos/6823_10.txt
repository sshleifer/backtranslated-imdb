I spent last week watching John Cassavetes' films - starting with "a woman under the influence" and ending with "opening night". I am completely and totally blown away, especially by these two films. from the first to the last opening night, I was completely absorbed. I have only experimented a few times, but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted about two thirds until the end of the credits. everything about this film, how it was shot, Gena Rowlands incredible performance, credits, openness, music, intrigue, sense of depth, rhythm, tenderness, originality, characters, small moments .... for me, it's really sublime. I totally agree with the previous comment about taking him to a desert island, because the depth of this film deserves to be seen. if you are unlucky enough to make a house fire, I guarantee you that instead of making one last attempt to save this reserve of money under your bed, you will rather save your copy of this film.
