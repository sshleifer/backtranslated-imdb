My mother took me to see this movie when it was released around Christmas 1976. I loved it then and I love it now. I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this one, but I think she looks and sounds good! ... And I seem to remember a number of women who copied this permanent look at the time! In addition, the scene of the bathtub between Streisand and Kristoferson is so sexy! The music is great too. It's the groovy 70's Babs at its best!
