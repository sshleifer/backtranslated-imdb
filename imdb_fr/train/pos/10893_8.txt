It's a good thing that I rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating of this site. It was a wonderful film that I will add to my Christmas selection. The cast was wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good lead role. I would say to viewers who have not seen the film to continue and buy it. I just notice it up there with Christmas holidays. The movie was very funny and well written and Ben plays very well the eccentric rich executive. What he says and does is how much I would imagine someone with too much money to act. The movie is much funnier than Santa and Christmas with the Kranks. Plus, he has a good story and teaches the true meaning of Christmas: you can not buy love with money.
