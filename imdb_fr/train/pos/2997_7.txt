William Powell is Philo Vance in "The Kennel Murder Case", a 1933 film with Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo entered his captain, the Scottish terrier, serves as a backdrop to a closed room mystery containing too many suspects. The mystery is very intelligent and the outcome both complicated and interesting. As the talkies are still quite young, the work of the camera is a little static, but Michael Curtiz directs the action well. <br /> <br /> The secondary distribution is excellent; the entire cast mounts the film one notch. Many actors have played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, William Warren and others. Powell has played most often (five times) and fits the role perfectly - very casual yet serious at the same time. This was done before "The Thin Man" propelled him to the spotlight - he had spent about 12 years in the cinema, starting his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable presence on the screen and an actor who lived nearly 92 years. We are very lucky to have his films available on DVD and on TCM today. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a beautiful story and a fun movie - do not miss it.
