Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedy, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for more than 10 years. Burns has retired and Matthau has taken it personally and has resented it ever since. That's the premise of Neil Simon's hilarious play turned into a movie. Of course, Matthau and Burns are at their peak, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as nephew and Matthau's agent. There are even old clips of real stars of the golden age that plunge you into the film, and character actor Fritz Feld starts with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who started at the theater in the 1930s with Orson Welles and was then grandmother in "Family Matters", is excellent in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have encountered with being too picky and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they first meet. Certainly, he has had a lot of resentment all these years, but some of his activities would be considered impolite or just bad manners taken out of context. Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau behave this way in other movies, but not George Burns. And the bellowing of Matthau tends to get a little old. <br /> <br /> In total, if you need a film always fun to help you and forget your problems, write "The boys of sun". They will cheer you up and make you think of a simpler time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: You have to drag it. "<br /> <br /> Matthau:" Wait, wait. I think you have to drag it. "
