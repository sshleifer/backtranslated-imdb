I do not remember many details about the series, but I remember how passionate I was about it and my determination not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately at the time we did not have a VCR so I never saw the show again. However, I strongly remember how I felt watching him and my enthusiasm every time. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor in recent days (I think I was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors of the day, mainly because of his appearance in the series. I would gladly buy / fly / download this series, I think I would make great efforts to see her again and revisit a childhood long gone ... Ideas? Does anyone know of a site devoted to the series, or did they record the tape episodes on their first broadcast?
