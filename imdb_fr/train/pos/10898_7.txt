This movie is not as bad as I heard. It was nice, fun and I love that it revolves around the holiday season. I'm totally in the mood for shopping for Christmas and listening to Christmas music. When this movie is released on DVD, it will replace the Christmas holidays in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to make me want to live the best time of the year. I heard that Ben's character was a little crazy, but I think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a touch of love. I liked that. No, it's not Titanic and it will not make your heart beat in anticipation, but it will cause a laugh or two. So go laugh and have a good time :)
