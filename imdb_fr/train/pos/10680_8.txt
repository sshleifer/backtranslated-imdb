As almost always, when Britain offers an entertaining and / or successful sit-com or quiz show, the Yanks come in and walk the format and produce their own, significantly inferior version. Man About The House is no exception to the rule. The version of the Yanks (Three's Company) was unassailable, a braindead that seems to last forever. An excellent example of quantity on quality (nonexistent). The original, on the other hand, is a gem that is fondly remembered (like Fawlty Towers) to be able to unplug at the right time (unlike the 637 episodes of "hilarity" invented by Three's Company). Jo was cute, there was a brilliant chemistry between the Ropers, Richard O'Sullivan made everything so easy, the scripts, although not exactly those of Oscar Wilde, were always fun and Chrissy was THE gorgeous woman who had walked the most face of this planet since the Dead Sea was just feeling bad. 'Nuff said.
