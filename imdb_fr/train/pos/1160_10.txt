It's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but it's funny. Kline and Fields are excellent. (Her throwing line "My God, you're so disgusting" as she climbs to the window - awesome! Kline enters the door after spotting Teri Hatcher - great too!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together perfectly - until he discovers who she really is ... a soap opera in his turn if there were any one! <br /> <br /> The scene towards the end in the Chinese dining room had my kids and I roll on the floor - this scene alone is worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> Solves no problem in the world and does not show the belly of daytime TV (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
