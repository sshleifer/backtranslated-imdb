it's not as good as the first movie, but it's a good solid movie, it has good scenes of car chase, for the remake of this movie, there is a story to follow for its hero to drive too. quick as his trying to rush to the side of his sick wife, the end is great just a good movie just to watch in my opinion, <br /> <br />
