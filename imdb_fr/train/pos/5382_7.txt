After watching the Next Action Star reality series, I was delighted to see the winners' movie immediately. I was suspicious of such a showcase of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual favorite, but Corinne and Sean stood by their side. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their cameo roles. Sean's character, not Bill's, is wanted, and his frustration at discovering new rules of the game is well played. Corinne walks the tightrope between her loving character Sean's and doing just that for the money. I loved how the game was played until the last second. And then beyond! This is not a good film, but an entertaining film and an excellent showcase for two people who are embarking for the first time.
