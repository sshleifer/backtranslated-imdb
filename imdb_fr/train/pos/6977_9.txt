I'm really addicted to Caprica, because it's a very good prequel series to Battlestar Galactica. His starting pace is really slow, but it should surely resume soon after the release of new episodes. <br /> <br /> I heard some great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season. <br /> This Sci Fi drama is sure to please all mix lovers of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does a great job, as well as Polly Walker and Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> Worth the detour !! !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on Friday at 9pm / 8pm in the center of SYFY
