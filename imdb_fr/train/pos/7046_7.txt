In War, Inc., we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities that we are currently conducting in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you know the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater abroad, you're already half-way home to fully appreciate the satire of Cusack's last piece. Cusack embodies a corporate hit, Brand Hauser, who is in Turiquistan to hold a trade show in the newly liberated country, waiting to access his latest target. While there, he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment journalist portrayed by Marisa Tomei and pursued by the hyper-sexualized pop star portrayed by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since, and the company's assistant named Marsha Dillon, who currently runs the entire operation for him (and played hilariously by Joan Cusack) . Although some moments are better played, they are not always the ones you expect and the little attentions often surprise you. All managers show solid performance. Duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very good job and tries to dispel her image of Disney. Tomei is funny, but sober, while the Cusacks have almost all the scenes in which they are. To be honest, they receive good equipment. The writers present a good scenario with enough twists and visual gags to make you laugh all along the foreseeable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that prevents me from classifying it higher as the story revolves around the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your broad and physical comedy, it's probably not enough here to keep you interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you like sneaky comedy and satire, this is for you.
