It's a very entertaining film that follows the rehearsal process of a New York production of Macbeth. Although he has a lot to say about power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's themes) in our modern world, the film works best when it does not take itself too seriously. Recognizable actors such as John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do good jobs in the main roles, but the highlight was for me the hilarious scene where the "murder" of Banquo (John Elsen) is repeated. This is probably a more entertaining film for theater actors, but anyone who loves Shakespeare should enjoy it.
