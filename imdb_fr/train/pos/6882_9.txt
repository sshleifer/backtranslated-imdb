I have not watched the movie yet, but can not wait to see it! It sounds very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen: the questions she posed really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach of the sport of boxing as a metaphor for "Inner combat" ... god someone is hitting another angle with the boxing thing. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really hot. I particularly enjoyed the short film with the film actor Rocky, really clever. I thought that the subject chosen - to overcome the trials and traumas of childhood - was out of time and God knows that a lot of people need it. Bring it on.
