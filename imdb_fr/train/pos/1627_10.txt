Blonde and Blonder has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more than one movie, you are totally unreasonable. It feels like a Carry On from the end of the era, when the show was no longer a track, but was even funnier than it is, think of Behind or England and you will not be not so far from the goal. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and aware that this is not a masterpiece they are doing, even though you can give it to me about a lot of things that I like. Supportive actors are energetic, although some of them are not particularly good; I do not see a few turns in a film that has almost been forgotten already, which makes all the difference, so smile. I really think Blonde and Blonder is an ace and I hope you hate me for that.
