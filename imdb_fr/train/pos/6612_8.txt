Just like Final Fantasy brought the CG to a whole new level, it's a rebirth for motion capture. Neither film nor cartoon, this film is like a tribute to Black Film, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris as it could almost be, the characters seem as real as you and me. They blink, stumble, tremble like real actors like never before. <br /> <br /> Do not go look at it hoping to find a mental twister. You will probably have understood it before being halfway to the film. The scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers, but it is certainly a happiness for the eyes.
