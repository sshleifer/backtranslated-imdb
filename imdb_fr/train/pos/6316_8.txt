This is not a "coward", but a precise and faithful remake of Monicelli's classic "I Soliti Ignoti" with Toto ', Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. And that's the reason is good, it copies all the fun characters and the intrigue, even in the details (like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I watched the beautiful old version several times and I knew all the gangs by heart and always enjoyed the end "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the lives and habits of the little thieves of 1950s Italy are adapted to the United States of 2002. Things have not changed much. 8/10.
