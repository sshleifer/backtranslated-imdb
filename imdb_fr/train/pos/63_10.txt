This film is so misunderstood that it's not even funny. If you think you will see this one for the shoot, stay away. It deals with the effects and traumas that survivors must undergo. Even detectives are looking for the answer we all make ... WHY? A fantastic game of the two main women as we see how those we ignore are affected by the same things as us. Yes, the language is sometimes hard, but it suits the characters well. There are some unresolved points left unanswered, but all films contain some. The major problems are discussed and this film explains how we all feel, adults, following such serious incidents. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
