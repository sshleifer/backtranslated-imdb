Still Crazy has been compared to Spinal Tap, both being comedies on R & R groups on hold. In fact, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and played, while the Spinal Tap script deteriorates after the first 10 minutes of play rather amusing in a maneuver that gives Beavis and Butthead a sophisticated aspect in comparison. Still Crazy is a formula, but the sympathy of the characters and the unexpected quality of certain musical numbers have managed to compensate for the predictability of the film. People who expect a satire attempt similar to Spinal Tap would be disappointed by the lightness of the film, but I would take an ironic Still Crazy madness on a pompous but unsuccessful shot of satire, Spinal Tap.
