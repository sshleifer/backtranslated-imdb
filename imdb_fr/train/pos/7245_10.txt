This is the only feature film on the bridge world. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect for describing professional bridge players and how to make a living. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very funny. I do not think a player other than bridge would play the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really beautiful, too bad the film is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The way the media is portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way that the earth bridge is like that. <br /> <br /> Watch as soon as you can and talk to your friends.
