It is written in stone that Disney's animations simply have to be musicals. Right? Or? Show me. Because I found that this attempt was much more enjoyable not to contain the classic Hokey musical fare designed for five years. <br /> <br /> The story was not as exciting as it could have been, but it was still pretty good, fun and adventurous. I had hoped for a little more, yes, taking into account the subject, but this film is not a bitter disappointment nor a total failure as it was announced. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is quite convincing, as well as the intrigue, intrigue, sub-plot and amazing creativity that I found in this production. I will refrain from describing the plot, as it was done and done, but this film is worth seeing if you are a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the best Disney animated feature film. <br /> <br /> He scores a 9.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
