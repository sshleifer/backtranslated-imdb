This film is really special. It's a very beautiful film. What begins with three orphans, Sho, his brother Shinji and their friend Toshi. They are poor children living on the street, but one day they managed to steal a bag full of money, then they could continue to live, buy a house, and their life seems to be much better. They make a new friend, friends for life. But something was wrong and they became enemies and everything ended by killing each other. <br /> <br /> I was negative at the beginning of this film, because when the singers (Gackt - Solo, ex-singer at Malice Mizer, Hyde - Solo, singer at L'Arc ~ en ~ Ciel, all two very famous in Japan and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer) trying to become actors, but it's not like the other singers-actors-movies. They do an excellent job and have no previous experience in film (with the exception of Lee-Hom, who had previously participated in two films before). <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite movies. It may be a bit because I'm a huge fan of Hyde, but it's this film that made me discover it. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (playing the main character - the Sho orphan) was a part of the group that wrote the script, and it was he who insisted that Hyde play the role of Sho's friend, the vampire Kei. At that time, they did not know each other, at least not as friends. But after the film, they became really good friends, and it also shows us that they really worked hard for this film and that they cooperated well. <br /> <br /> The film has many different feelings throughout history, love, hate, sadness, pain, loneliness, happiness and so on. I think the first hour is the best, it's so beautiful. After people die, Kei goes away and everything changes so much. But it's still a good movie, it's the only movie that ever made me cry, it's finally so sad, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen this movie, you really should. Because it's wonderful, but sad. You will not regret it. ^^
