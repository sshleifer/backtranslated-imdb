To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animated film. The film had its stockings, but overall, I felt that the story was strong and that the characters were easy to understand. It was also nice to see an animated Disney movie that was not a musical. I was on the point pushed to the limit with Tarzan. Fortunately, they let the music rest. Another interesting element of the film is that the comedy is not completely foolish (to the Hercules), rather subtle, so that it makes children laugh while not making adults crazy or completely stupid. <br /> <br /> A disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated movies taking place outside of Disney Studios, you'd think they would advance and catch up a bit. There is something to say about the tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the history of Atlantis! Overall, the movie was entertaining and was well worth the trip by the multiplex. <br /> <br />
