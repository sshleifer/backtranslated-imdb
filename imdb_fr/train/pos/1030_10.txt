I propose this and BABYLON 5 as the best science fiction television series ever made. Both come to mind because, unlike the first series of STAR TREK, intrigues and characters evolve steadily. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, they were good shows, but there was no general theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch programs completely out of sequence without any difficulty in understanding what's going on. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that occupied the last season) and other TREK shows, as there was a bigger story unifying them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw it even more with SG-1. The bottom line is that, in many ways, this series has been like watching a family or a long novel slowly take shape. Of course, there were some "throwaway" episodes that were not related to the rest, but they were very few and far between, and were also quite fun. <br /> <br /> And speaking of funny, I loved that SG -1 kept the mood from time to time and was not so serious. In this way, I really enjoyed more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and his love for Homer Simpson. It's a shame that he slowly disappeared from the show in the following seasons. <br /> To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how well the graphics work. This consistency gives the show an exceptional performance. And, if you do not like SG-1 after giving it a chance, science fiction is probably not the kind that suits you.
