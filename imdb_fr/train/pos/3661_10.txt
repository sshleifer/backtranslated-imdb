Snobs and pseudo-experts consider it "far from the best of De Sica" Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem to connect to this masterpiece. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. His Italianism does not have the convoluted self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers, nor the bitter parody of Pietro Germi, the sweet sweetness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us these stories as a father sitting on the edge of his children's bed before falling asleep. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo In Milano and to a lesser extent, Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what we today call magical realism. The film is a jewel from start to finish and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but which, of course, requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its pure state. Magnificent.
