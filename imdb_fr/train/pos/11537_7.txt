Neil Simon was good at dialogue and nowhere is this more obvious than the phrases he gives to WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opposite types in THE ODD COUPLE - a mixture of comedy and sadness that rests entirely on the credibility of two friends as incompatible an apartment. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is a neatnik Felix Ungar, decided to commit suicide after the divorce of his wife and who reluctantly agrees to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with somewhat disastrous results. It seems that everything Felix says and does makes Oscar rise to the wall and neither of them can stand the other's means, Oscar being the most messy male imaginable and Felix the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> The most fun scene for me was when the laughter The Pigeon Sisters from the apartment above visit them on dinner day. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau, Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in order. The talented Pigeon sisters are the girls who made the voice of the sisters Gabble (a pair of geese) in THE ARISTOCATS of Disney. Here, their comic timing over Lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to turn the film into hilarity. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and have enjoyed other treatments of his work on the screen, this one is not to be missed. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly chosen (even if they were considering exchanging their roles before shooting began) and, of course, it's easy to see why it became a prominent television show afterwards. <br /> <br /> In summary: Top Comedy of Simon, not to be missed.
