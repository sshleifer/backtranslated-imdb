David Lynch's most personal work is perhaps the most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that imply or imply a plot or represent something other than vivid nightmares, Lynch offers reflexive and fragile meditation on the universal topics of aging and the family and reassures them. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who travels to Wisconsin with a lawnmower to visit his torn and distraught brother - there are still many unique and original visual landscapes (images striking city center aerials, filmed by veteran director of photography Freddy Francis) to make an undeniable effort for Lynch and characterizations that are among his most memorable. Farnsworth is excellent in his stoic but pleasant style, allowing the stories he hears during his journey to become an integral part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of his finest work into a smaller role in as long as her intellectually-minded daughter is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle twist of the sensitive scenario of John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small one-person cast offers indelible performances, one of the most remarkable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing the deer is both frantic and sad. But it's the vintage Lynch with its ability to engage you and destabilize you at its best. For those who do not know Lynch or know him only by his troubling and violent reputation, this is a great place to start; for those who know his work, it's one of the best in his repertoire.
