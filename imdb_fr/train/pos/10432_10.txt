I must admit that at first I was a little reluctant to watch this movie. I thought it was that stupid little romantic film about a French woman meeting an American on the train and decided to visit her in Vienna. I was really not happy with this kind of scenario because it kept me thinking it was just a movie. Yet, I watched it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" is one of the few films that dares to speak in a rather philosophical way, questioning the fact that at the moment of our birth, we are condemned to death, or that is a mean idea that the fact that a couple stays together for eternity or that we, humans, can sometimes allow us to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end has been marvelously chosen (we do not know if they will see each other in six months, at six o'clock, at the Vienna train station). In our optimism, we sincerely hope. The actors played very well, so I started to believe that I could live a love story like this myself.
