I read a little about Che before watching this movie and you want to know something, he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted equality for all and he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other Latin Americans in general! Now, I do not know about others, but for me, he has done the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone pays his fair share. However, the powerful elite was obviously not going down that road. Thus, rather than understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It did not work because there were too many of his other supporters who only started where he left off. Castro continued his leadership in Cuba and is a good example. As far as I am concerned, and as Che himself said just before he died, "If you kill me, that's fine, but you are only killing a man, you will NEVER kill the cause!" I could not have said it myself. <br /> <br /> But ... ALWAYS .... that's why I give this film a 7 out of 10.
