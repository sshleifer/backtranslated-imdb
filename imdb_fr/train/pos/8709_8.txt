I recently (May 2008) discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although I have seen a lot of high quality movies since that time (late 70s (I was 10 years old in 1978)), this three-episode, low-budget movie is still solid. <br /> I now watched her with my 10 year old daughter and she lived the same thing that I remember at the time: the scary music (she had to hold my hand even though she grew up watching LotR and Resident Evil) changing the theories about the identity of the culprit and complaining of the theatrical voices of an era prior to that of Norway discovered the difference between theater and cinema. <br /> <br /> This is the only good sci-fi movie (or series) ever made in Norway. And it's always worth watching.
