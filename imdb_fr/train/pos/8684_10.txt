This is one of the first and best Columbos, with Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo, along with several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also made an appearance later. <br /> <br /> In this one, Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has an affair, so he hires Culp to investigate. Culp has a blackmail company on the side, so he gives a false report to Milland and threatens Crowley of the truth if she does not pay. They argue at Culp and she ends up being murdered. Enter Columbo. <br /> <br /> Culp is doing everything in his power to get Columbo's fate, including offering him a job, but Columbo has joined him since the beginning. <br /> <br /> Excellent episode.
