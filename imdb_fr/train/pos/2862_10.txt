My comment is generally limited to the first season, 1959-1960. <br /> <br /> This superb series was one of the first to be televised in color. She had a great influence in persuading Americans to buy a color television, which cost about $ 800 in 1959, more than $ 3,000 today. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a program transmitted by a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series started and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Looking at it now, 50 years later, many things come to mind. First, there are many stories about the Comstock vein and the pinnacle of silver mining, which dates back to 1859. By 1859, most weapons and clothing were not authentic. (The haircuts are left out of the discussion.) It's basically a nitpick. <br /> <br /> And it would have been impossible for Ben to have arrived in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed 100 square mile ranch in the next twenty years. The pioneers were still trying to solve the problem of Sierra Nevada until 1847 and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians are not played by Amerindian actors. John Ford used Native American actors in the 1920s. Bonanza producers could easily have done so thirty years later. This is for me a major tattoo. <br /> <br /> There are other calendar issues. In season 1, Mark Twain appears and he is described as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also fluctuate between 1859-1860 (before the American Civil War) and what was better suited to a period of 1880. There are continuity issues over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat disconcerting, too, that there are so many deaths in the first season. Over time, the number of murders has been reduced. <br /> <br /> Many episodes have a socially liberal orientation, which would be difficult to believe given the chronology, but we must recognize that the authors were able to anticipate the seismic changes the attitudes of the Nation from 1960s. <br /> <br /> That said, the acting is good and I managed to conclude in my last years that the character of Adam was better drawn than all the others. I do not think Pernell Roberts ever had the credit he deserved. In addition, season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Most stories trace true historical events. The guests were interesting. <br /> <br /> It was great entertainment for the family and the show resists very well in every way.
