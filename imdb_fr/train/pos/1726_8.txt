Thinking of "The Great Escape", I let my mind wander in this little gem movie of my childhood. I had read and re-read the autobiographical novel of 1949 that inspired it, and when it was the only cinema (we had never used that word at the time) of the city showing "foreign" films, I was the first to buy my ticket. <br /> <br /> During the Second World War, when I heard about news and war propaganda, I had a keen interest in exploring the realities of this conflict, as evidenced by the memories and stories of men who were present. This later spread to a relentless drive over the years to buy any book on the subject and read the equally compelling novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which offered even more sensitivity deep. Film versions, however, did not look like this in that they rarely delivered the goods. <br /> <br /> The black and white film support has never been as well served as it was at the time. I have never seen a technicolor version of the war that seems as authentic as the obscure obscurities of films like "The Wooden Horse". If it is true that we are destined to always be captive of images of our childhood, then I admit it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will be no one like Leo Genn as an iconic British war hero. on the film. Not even Sir Alec.
