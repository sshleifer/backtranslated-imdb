This wonderful little film contains all the elements that made Western Spaghetti so exciting and fun: great music (by one of the few, if not the only one .. female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), action sequences EXCITING (and very vicious for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and scenery (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). He also has a very good story with a beautiful story of tragic romance. The actors do a fantastic job - with outstanding performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (the most important role for a woman in a spaghetti western ... outside Cardinale in "Once upon a time in the West"). Without a spoiler poster, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any movie I have ever seen!
