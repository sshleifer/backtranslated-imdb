In Iran, women are officially banned from male sports events. In June 2005, the Iranian national football team will play an important match against Bahrain at the Azadi stadium for the World Cup qualification. A group of Iranian girls and lovers of football uniforms like boys are trying unsuccessfully to get arrested in the stadium. <br /> <br /> Football (and Flamengo's team), the beach and the movies are my greatest passions; That's why I loved this gem that talks about a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi of "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle" shot this film the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The drama and fun adventure of these Iranians is one of the most delicious movies I have ever seen. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
