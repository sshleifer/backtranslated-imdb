This documentary chronicles the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter, who lived as a recluse in their family's mansion in East Hampton, New York from the mid-1950s to the end. When the filmmakers find them, the mansion is falling apart and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share a sordid room. The oldest Edie Beale is Jackie Kennedy Onassis' aunt and the youngest is her first cousin. The women were originally to be evicted from the house due to her run-down condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could continue living there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, this film may seem like an exploitation, no woman seems in the best of mental health, but at other times, the film is hard to watch. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current condition, and her mother tells her that Edie would never know what she thought she was. "Little" Edie often seems trapped in the past, focused on the choices she made decades ago and loves to show images of her youth, where she was clearly a beautiful beginner. His mother seems more resigned to her fate, to live the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are clear allusions to the glamorous life of the two women, pictures that show a happy family at Edie's tall older portrait near her bed. From what we see from the house, most of the rooms are empty, the walls creak and collapse, and "the little" Edie leaves food in the attic to allow the raccoons to feast. And of course, there are many cats running. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this documentary is incredibly sad. Although neither of the two women seems particularly depressed by her fate in life, the misery in which they live is quite terrible. It is not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house and it looks like they have been abandoned by their families. <br /> <br /> However, as a documentary, the film is a marvel to see and is highly recommended.
