I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series to date, I say POTENTIAL .. we all know that there is a chance that they give up the ball and that they lack ideas ... BUT I hope not! For those who have not seen it, see it! Without that annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" that floats over their heads every time they meet races, it could be cool ... and Scott Bakula was definitely a GREAT CHOICE for Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is hot also (Look at the decontamination scene) I gave him a FULL 10 ... it blows all the other openers .. I hope it will last more than 7 years ...
