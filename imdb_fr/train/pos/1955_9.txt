Just the kind of movie I like. Very good British actors as well as the one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) brilliantly manipulates the lives of educated people, exploiting their weaknesses to gather experiences and write a mystery book of murder. She plays the female psychopath quite well while using her sex appeal to convincingly portray what might be considered one of the ultimate black widows. Tramell is accustomed to the dark places of society and freely participates in sadomasochistic adventures in the "never visited after the darkness" part of the city. From the beginning, there is nothing less than a R note in the dialogue alone. Stone could also be described as a kind of woman Hannibal Lecter, a femme fatale without emotion without the meal plan.
