Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was a very lucky woman many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had a lot of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she dedicated herself to providing a sanctuary to the furry animals on her property. Trudy also raised two chimpanzees at her home to look more like children. They dressed and had a lot of equipment. One day, she learns that a baby gorilla is abandoned. Not knowing anything about the great apes, she relies on her husband's medical skills and her husband's advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger, Trudy decides that she will also raise the gorilla as one of her children. It's been working well for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is really a remarkably smart addition to his home. But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and his monkey develop a unique relationship in the annals of history and animal traditions. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla, but a villain, in the movie, but he's very close to sounding totally real. Russo gives a great performance as a woman ahead of her time and the support players are also very nice. The costumes are exemplary, as in the early days of history, and the sets and exceptional production values. But, more importantly, animals are here in abundance, not just Buddy, but adorable chimpanzees, ducks, rabbits, and so on. For those who want to watch a movie and be transported to animal paradise here on earth, it's an excellent film choice. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a big family movie, will go "monkey" to Buddy.
