THREE SERIES - BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want something done right, kill Baldrick before you start", in the wake of the second series, the show came back with the current owner of the famous name, a victim of his luck and serving as butler Prince Regent, a vain and silly sheet for the venom of the Blackadders, played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still in tow of the other piece of the comic puzzle. The format is similar to that of the previous show, after all, they had now found the winning formula to change things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich from behind the gullible ruler in more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick a Mr. or trying to hurt a wife suitable for the prince. In many ways, this is one of the most accurate series of the series, the Prince Regent actually took control of the throne during his father's madness and some crazy characters have talked a lot about it. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
