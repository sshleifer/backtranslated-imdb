Michael Bowen plays the role of an innocent young man who travels several thousand kilometers hitchhiking to visit his missing millionaire father (the terrifying Ray Wise) in a sprawling ranch with a wind engine and ends up getting tangled in the dangerous network of his young beautiful intriguing and seductive mother of hell. (the delicious Clare Wren), thus causing problems to the already dysfunctional family. An edgy, elegant and exciting drama that has not received any promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I saw it for the first time. It is beautifully written, intelligently interpreted and tightly directed by a script that allows you to bite your nails. I can not believe that commentators who did not like him have ever seen it. It's an undiscovered classic.
