This has been seen several times on the Sundance channel many years ago and has received a nice kinematic shake of the system. A semi-surrealist and harsh vision of modern media culture (or lack thereof), focused on critically upset people, far beyond the suburbs of Hollywood. He had a fun performance at the beginning of Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable footage of the DP that shot the movies of the Polish brothers. There was a wild and uncompromising humor and a strangely original feeling that clearly distinguished him. This movie had a cult classic written on it, and I'm surprised it has not been released on DVD yet. <br /> <br /> Hope that soon.
