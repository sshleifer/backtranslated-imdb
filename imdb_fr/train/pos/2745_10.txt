I've seen a lot of movies, but 'In Cold Blood' is a special case. He excels in all departments. The fact that it contains few big stars helps push it further when you pay more attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee. Blake and Wilson present the exceptional performance of the duo killer. The fact that most movies are shot in the same places where the crime was committed, even inside the house, adds chills. Black / white photography darkens the mood and the photography is beautiful. There are many exceptional cinematic works, but if I could only vote for one of them at the top of the list, it would most likely be "In Cold Blood".
