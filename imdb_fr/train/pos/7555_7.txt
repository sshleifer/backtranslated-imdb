Gender Bender puts things forward for x-files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an end that is missing. Gender Bender is also the first film of actor Nicholas Lea, better known under the pseudonym Alex Krycek. In this episode, he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of the "The Kindred". You have to see this episode just to see Nic Lea's less than spectacular debut. An interesting thing about the "power of seduction" Kindred. When Marty does it to his victims, they turn to him. However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she does it only because she is disoriented and groggy and she does not become attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me why it would sometimes be unfortunate to film in British Columbia. Throughout the episode, it is so wet, soggy and muddy, it could not have been so much fun. Despite its disappointing end, Gender Bender remains a decent episode to watch.
