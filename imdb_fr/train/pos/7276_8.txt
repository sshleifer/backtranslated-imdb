When I rented this movie, I thought I would go see a horror movie. However, there is little horror in this mysterious drama of the sixties directed by the strange James T. Flocker. The beautiful Matt Boston is wearing the photo with its beautiful performance and the strange atmosphere typical of Flocker's films is omnipresent.
