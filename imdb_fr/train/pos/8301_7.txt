Gary Busey is the main character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your reckless maverick cop who earned his nickname because no matter how many balls he takes (38 in cash), he never stops getting take to the bad guys. <Br /> <br /> When an American tank called "Thunderblast" crosses the Mexican border, it is caught by revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogado (Rene Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva), who aligned himself. with the Russian bad guys. The military personnel involved are being held in custody, including Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is McBain's ex-girlfriend. McBain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not have the physical presence, for example someone like Schwarzenegger, who would have been another appropriate leader for such a movie, but a breath like a guy confident who is fast with the witches. Fluegel is a great female role; she not only looks incredibly sexy, but makes her a beautiful action baby. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez and the always-welcome William Smith (as Russian major) are loathsome in the tradition of classic action movies. The cast is filled with actors of known and reliable characters: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Watson Mills, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman provide the script, based on a story by Lankford and veteran director B Fred Olen Ray. This is the kind of scenario where you know that writers have their tongues in their cheeks: they know that their material is absurd and cheesy and have fun throwing credibility through the window. The veteran action director, Steve Carver, continues to move and releases a respectable amount of gunfire, explosions and total chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is a good way to entertain action fans, who do not hesitate to extinguish from time to time, their brains enjoy a generous assortment of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
