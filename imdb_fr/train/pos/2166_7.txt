I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson but I must admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a little embarrassing with some scenes a little edgy, I did not know that it was necessary to classify this film as a bit SF and a little horrible. I saw it around 2 am on my local channel. There was nothing else. So I decided to watch it. If you have not seen this movie, I do not recommend it that badly, the characters are quite interesting but I do not know if this movie went to the cinema, but we have the impression that it is made for the television or go directly to the video, I would buy it if it is on DVD, it corresponds well to my type of film and contains a small extract of the history of X-FILES. Government companies or unstable companies involved in dark and obscure transactions. It's a good movie.
