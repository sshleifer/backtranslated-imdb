I think a lot of viewers completely missed the fact that it was obviously a parody of Western movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it's a smart language for taking westerns. I do not think this film takes seriously for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie even more unique is the fact that it is centered on 4 strong and beautiful women, two of whom are black, an Asian and Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> These are not your usual Western women - they are tough - they can draw quickly and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> They are so difficult that even the bartender shakes when he pours his whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that advances this story is typical westerns - in the vein of "you shot my brother - so I" I'll get you! "Only in this Western, a woman's sister was killed and she wants revenge on the gang who did it. <br /> <br /> She goes to her old friend's house to get her back. <Br <br /> <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, does not really want to avenge Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact that there is gold and jewels hidden in the city they're heading to. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not really make sense, not that they're so embarrassing, they can be ignored, but I wondered why they were So, the film could use a little bit more tight, but overall, it's a well done movie that has failed to find an audience that recognizes what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment is that the only lesbian in the movie is a villain - "heroines", one is obviously straight, the other sexual orientations are never disclosed. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
