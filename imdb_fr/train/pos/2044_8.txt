It's a good little shock. not perfect by an effort of imagination, but tight, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea that has turned into a compelling 90-minute storyline. <br /> <br /> The installation does not require bells or whistles, long presentations, or history stories; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German businesswoman living in London, walks away waiting for the last train. She wakes up to find the deserted place, but soon realizes she is far from alone. Someone or something is there with her and her intentions are quite malicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, she meets several other characters in search of survival, including a lewd co-worker, a homeless couple and a cage. wastewater, which all add rhythm and substance to the plot. There is a slightly awkward shifting somewhere in the middle of the film when the tension thriller turns into a gore fest, but nothing more awkward than slowing the fast pace. For those of you who have weak dispositions, it may be a difficult race; For those of you who like a bit of well-executed carnal heckling, you have to press the right buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film, but it is punctuated with a good moment of unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some may feel a bit misled by a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat faced by Kate and her Confederates, however, for me it was not the case. A horror film writer should not need to feel obliged to score every point, in the same way as a writer of political thrillers. There is enough evidence to give you a very clear idea of ​​what gave rise to this evil, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. The retention of a certain sense of mystery must be welcomed and reminds us that in this film, the journey would always be more important than the exact destination. <br /> <br /> I understand that the budget of this film was minimal, in which case our applause for this British horror should be even stronger, because at no time do we have the impression that turns are cut or effects that do not give the expected results. <br /> <br /> If this sounds like your kind of movie, then that's probably the case. Buy a ticket and get on board.
