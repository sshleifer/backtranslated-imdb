War is hell. But this documentary on the Second World War is a paradise. <br /> <br /> This series is not only a breathtaking look, almost exhaustive on the Second World War, it is a poetic masterpiece told clearly and beautifully by Laurence Olivier. <Br/> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It's long without a doubt, but you'll enjoy them all and want to come back for more and more. (I have the series on DVD and I probably watch it three times a year). <br /> <br /> Really, it's a flawless movie. Besides Olivier, the best part of the series is to listen to veterans tell their stories; Whether it's a real battle or looking for a pork butcher to have something delicious for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'll watch it right now (again ... 11th time).
