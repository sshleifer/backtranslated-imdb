This is an entertaining look at the gospel presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) that sings a lot and tells a little too. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is very nice. Also note the blonde depiction of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blond hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun presentation of the biggest and most important of all stories.
