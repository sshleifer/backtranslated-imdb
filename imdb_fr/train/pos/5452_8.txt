A pre-code stunner with Stanwyck playing a damn speakeasy that sleeps to the top. These pre-code movies really let everything go without leaving anything to the imagination. Stanwyck is notable as Lilly, the daughter of a speakeasy owner / father who sold more alcohol than his customers. After the old man is dead (good!), Barb goes to the big city for better things. She uses her feminine attributes for she sleeps to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that actors improve with age and that they are coaches. I loved the jokes and the strong lines between the actors. I highly recommend this movie to all moviegoers and watch Stanwyck who is awesome and handsome like Lilly.
