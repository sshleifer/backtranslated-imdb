If you have read and read the mothers' night and liked it so much (as I did) that you only need to see the film, understand that you must understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - beyond of his story, there is Vonnegut can not put a human spirit on the screen. His humor and humor simply can not be transcribed by a screenplay or even by the best acting performance. I think this film goes beyond asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but these frequent cynical satire moments found on the page do not end up on the screen. Does this mean the film is missing the target? Of course not. In my opinion, the film succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (it is not a support for those who are too lazy to turn a page). He succeeds because he takes the basic elements of a story created by one of the true American art treasures and presents it in an unpretentious setting. I have seen other film versions of the Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel the genius of Vonnegut and loses control of his own art. I would not say that this film is one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs and deserves to be watched. By removing Vonnegut's "voice" from the film's narration or trying to insert it as best as it can, Mother Night tells its story with flying colors and preserves its fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
