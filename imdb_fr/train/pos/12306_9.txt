A story of Chinese ghosts portrays the great and lamented Leslie Cheung in the role of Ling Choi Sin, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night in a deserted temple, where he falls and falls in love with a beautiful woman named Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling discovers that Tsing is in fact a ghost who was forced to seduce victims for an evil spirit of the tree that feeds on 'chi' (vital force), he decides to try to free the girl by giving him an appropriate burial. Engaging the help of swordsman Yin (Wu ma), a crazy Taoist monk, Ling manages to defeat the spirit of the tree, but must also fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, to whom Tsing must marry . <br /> <The first Hong Kong movie I saw that was not a simple martial arts action, A Chinese Ghost Story opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical kingdom inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, innocent heroes, the sword wielding Taoist monks, monstrous spirits and dark lords of the underworld; I immediately fell in love with the exuberance, energy, humor, inventiveness and visual excellence of the film. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, this amazing film remains one of the finest examples of its kind I've seen? A sumptuous masterpiece breathtaking, which brilliantly combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. With superb direction from Siu-Tung Ching, excellent editing by David Wu, breathtaking cinematography and a host of imaginative special effects (including a huge deadly tongue, many spooky monsters and several flying heads!), A Chinese Ghost Story is a completely unforgettable and really enjoyable experience from start to finish.
