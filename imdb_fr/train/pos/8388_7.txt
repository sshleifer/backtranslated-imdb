Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman, presented in a complete and very credible way, although she is so obtuse that she borders on implausibility. She will do everything to make her marriage work, including unscrupulous opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so, under the exterior of vice, it reveals a rather mild system of values. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending that, afterwards, turns out to be totally inadequate, with the convenience that is familiar to you to finish your creative writing exercise at school with 'and then I woke up'. At the end of the book, it also contains the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but do not be fooled.
