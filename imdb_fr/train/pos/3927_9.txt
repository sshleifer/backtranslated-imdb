OK, first correct the tag displayed on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not walk with her sister in the movie and did not stop at her sister's grave. The person in question is Ann Rutledge, who was a very close friend of Lincoln at the time of New Salem. Some say that Ann was actually Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support it. <br /> <br /> There are now fabrications and fictionalizations in this film. Hollywood has always taken dramatic licenses with something under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the court case that is in the film is based on a real event: the murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although it's largely fictional in this movie with a lot of name changes, the viewers will stay focused on the screen. It's Hollywood's golden age, with the drama at its best, and Henry Fonda probably gives the best Lincoln played by anyone.
