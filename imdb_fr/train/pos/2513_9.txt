Beautifully done. A lot of anxiety. Friendship may not be sustainable, but in the end it's all that matters, that is, a group of friends who are learning. I watched it again and again. The music is also amazing. When Kei loses one of his friends, he abandons him until he meets Sho, an orphan who is not repelled by his true nature. In the lawless streets of Mallepa, they fight for their own place among the mixture of Asian races and learn that sometimes, being at the top can cost you more than you are always willing to pay. A surprise that ends as much as the whole movie. I could not get enough. Gackt and Hyde do an excellent acting job, proving that they are more than just beautiful boys singing.
