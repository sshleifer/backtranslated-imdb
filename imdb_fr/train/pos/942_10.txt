This is the best cinematic version of Dicken's classic tale. I have seen it many times on VHS and recently bought the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (no widescreen). What I find interesting in this TV broadcast is the English actors who are now recognizable since many of them have appeared in other movies / shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "The Equalizer", the Christmas Ghost. .
