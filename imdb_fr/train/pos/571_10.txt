Looking at how the two brothers interact and feed throughout the film, I am personally happy to live in the countryside, much like they did in the movie. I have watched this movie countless times and the book is right next to my Bible. After watching the film, I agree that it is one of the few films to do justice to a book. I highly recommend anyone who has the chance to go to Montana to fish or be outside to do so. It's amazing. I can not think of anyone else who could play the role better than Brad Pitt. Render justice and watch one of the best movies of the modern cinematic era. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED And as a guide for fishing trips in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to steal fish from the scenes of the movie, because even if it looks great on the movie, you'll never have no idea of ​​the practice and skill that really takes. Thank you for listening Watch this movie please if you want a long, sad movie.
