It's my favorite classic. He was shot a little west of Philadelphia, PA, at the age of 13, in 1957, and released the following year. Then, in 1970, I found myself working in the same riding as the rookie, the state policeman. I always liked to visit the different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well and there was a road sign indicating to all passing motorists that this was the "crash site". The theatrical scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park, and she continues to show movies today!
