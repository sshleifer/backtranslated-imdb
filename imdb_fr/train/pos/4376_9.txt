Liam Neeson describes the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor of the early 18th century. He is a real actor. He seduces the public with his charisma as in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's his love that makes Rob Roy a legend, but it's his passion that makes him love. They need each other. Tim Roth as the villain Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, watching the movie, you'll find Cunningham disgusting. The Scottish landscape is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the time are pretty well described. If you love history, romance, passion and love, you'll love Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell this story as it should be. no gratuitous violence. And you must listen carefully if you are not used to a Scottish accent. An important point that makes this film so good is that no actor or actress is glorified; they get dirty and look unattractive in various scenes. It's their skills as actors that attract you. They do not rely on the names of capitals, the popularity or appeal of the sex symbols. It's something special.
