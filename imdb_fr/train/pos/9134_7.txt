"Purple Rain" has never been a favorite of critics, but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you are a Prince fan, this is for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is that Prince sees his violent parents in himself and falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie is not just about singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it's warm to the heart. Sometimes it sounds funny, but when it works, it really works. Very hazardous. <br /> <br /> Nobody can really play in the movie. Everyone is from one of Prince's sides acting as "The Time" and "Vanity 6". Yet, that adds charm to the movie. Every time Prince is on the screen, he lights it up and it's fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, go see if you like Prince like me. If you are not a fan, you will do one.
