The title of this movie does not make much sense unless you see it working, because it's the sound a retarded young man emits while using his imaginary tramway, as he done all day. And he's just one of the many strange characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunkards exchanging women, a man aspiring to be an architect, and his young son whom he sends to beg for food. There is a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of mental health in everything going on around him, and there is a businessman with some serious nervous twitches who has a woman who treats him (and all the world) like dirt. <br /> There is no particular plot in this area, it's a bunch of stories coming and going between them, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. Overall, I found that it worked quite well and I was longing to see this for a long time, based on its description. I was not disappointed at all and would recommend it without hesitation. 9 out of 10
