Here's a curiosity: a modern-day movie about a serial killer who has no fight scenes, no one has been seen dying, no car chases and no loud noise ..... and he gets takes place in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are horrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is a detective job and the amount of paperwork the poor detective had to undergo to solve the murders. It's a very dark film, and "dark" best describes the character of the hero (Stephen Rea). Still, the story is not depressing and it is very interesting throughout. <br /> <br /> Rea is remarkable as a determined detective, harassed. Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scared as a killer. The Russian accent of Donald Sutherland is suspect, but he plays the only character of this film that has a certain heat. <br /> <br /> Once again, history is dotted with liberal agendas, here and there, not one but two references to bias against homosexuals, the total validity of secular psychology, the police and the government officials being rude / brutal / fanatics, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's an intelligent and refreshing detective film. This is a rather unique film that is probably not well known but much appreciated by those who have seen it. As it is based on a realistic account of this killer, it is all the more scary. Do not let this happen just because you have nothing to do with it.
