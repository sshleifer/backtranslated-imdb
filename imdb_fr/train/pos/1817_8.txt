All dogs go to paradise plays on the criminal canine underworld. The film is a delight for children with a comic and dark scenario, but satisfying and happy, with lots of songs and dances. We see Charlie, another murdered criminal murderer who returns but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who addresses him, and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. It's a cute animation that I like a lot through my child's eyes. I highly recommend this movie to children. I am not sure of the reaction of adults. (I tried to watch it a few years ago on VHS, but these recordings do not last long, do they?)
