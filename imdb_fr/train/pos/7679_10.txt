For my social science district project at school, I chose trafficking in human beings. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just watched the movie and I'm still thinking about it. All I can say is "Wow". This is the fascinating story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American named Patric who is trying to save her. The end leaves you breathless, and although it is not a happy ending, it is very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to everyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for it and because of what's happening to it. I liked it so much and now I want to know what will happen next!
