I watch them all. <br /> <br /> It's not better than the amazing ones (_Strictly Ballroom_, _Shal on danse? _ (Japanese version), but it's quite respectable and nicely different in parts. <br /> < I'm a teacher of English and I find that the ignorance about the language in some of these magazines is rather upsetting For example: the name must shout must not be watched How it moves. can movie titles ignore grammar? "<br /> <br /> There is nothing fundamentally wrong in English Caribbean grammar, it is simply not standard Canadian English grammar. The comments on the dialogue seem odd.I put the subtitles because I am a standard Canadian English speaker, so I AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have a hard time understanding everything.It was not so difficult and that gave a different flavor, because the other films I saw were also American. <br /> <br /> I loved that film is happening in Toronto and, in fact, I would like it to be even clearer. loved that the heroine was so atypically cast. I enjoyed the progress routines. I liked the animated character of mom. I had the impression that many of the issues discussed in the film were treated with more subtlety than dance films. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you tend to like dance movies, then it's a decent job. If you have problems with the grammar of the English standard in which you grew up, your narrow mind may have a hard time enjoying this movie.
