Tony Hawk Underground came at a time when the series was really starting to lose its luster. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the show really in the air about what Neversoft and Activision could do with the show, which is different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced the storymode, which was very cool because it created a whole new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Another featured feature that has been fairly defended by fans is to be able to leave skateboarding, which is good because you can now ride, run and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft has also improved a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs. The first two games on PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were good and long and some hidden features. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been shortened because of a handful of added features that really pushed the systems to their limits. In this version, they have shortened these features, there are not as many people wondering in the streets, in fact there are almost none at certain levels, and the graphics and physics of skating are slightly attenuated, but not much. <BR/> <br /> This game has a disadvantage, the storymode is a bit short, of course, this is the first time Neversofts does it with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, that being said, you will definitely end this game in the day. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great addition that has been very refreshing.
