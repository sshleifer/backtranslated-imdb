Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget coolers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the best. <br /> <br /> Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young wives and kills them, then extracts fluid from their bodies so that he can keep his aging wife looking young. After a journalist and a doctor spend the night at his house and discover that he is responsible for the death of the wives, the next morning, they report the murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot dead shortly afterwards. <br /> <You have almost everything in this film: the scientific assistants consist of an old witch, a hunchback and a dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife find that they sleep better in coffins than in a bed. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes is worth seeing, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
