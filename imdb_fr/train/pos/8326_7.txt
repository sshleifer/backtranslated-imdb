While Fred Schepisi "I.Q." does not really have any important qualities, it's always worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton Ph.D. candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). The most amusing scene is probably where Dr. Frizzyhead and his friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to give Ed a scientific air: he ends up looking like a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Obviously, little of the film is historically accurate, but that's not the goal. This is by no means a light comedy, unlike Robbins' most famous 1994 film (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's whole life should cover not only his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, including how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and opposed nuclear weapons ( to the point where the FBI kept a record on it). <br /> <br /> So anyway, this one is acceptable. With Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
