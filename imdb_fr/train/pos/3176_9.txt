I was lucky to see this film during a screening in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the plot; he has a lot of wacky characters, but let's say that I would have a hard time choosing which of the two made me laugh the loudest, I would not know where to start. Even the peripheral roles are well written and well played. <br /> <br /> There are many small touches that make it unique and very nice, it has some "features" that appear and add another hilarious layer. It's refreshing to watch; no recycled stuff I had seen many times before. If this film could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it would be a real pleasure for the crowd, the story is so original and sincere. <br /> <br /> There are many things to love here, exciting stories, mishaps and misunderstandings that make up the final act and the dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart. it's a touching story with a quick comedy woven all the way through. Well worth a visit!
