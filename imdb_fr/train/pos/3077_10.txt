I missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on ABC's website in the summer of 2007. I'm absolutely crazy about the show. I think all the actors are excellent. This is one of my favorite series. I just checked out ABC programming for this fall and did not see it in the schedule. It's truly sad. I hope they'll bring it back ... maybe they expect Bridget Moynahan to have her baby? Or is it just wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments posted about the show and saw so many glowing comments, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or, hopefully, another channel
