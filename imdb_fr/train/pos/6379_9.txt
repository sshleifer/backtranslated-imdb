The film "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a brilliant jewel among the rubble of films recently produced by Disney Studios. Parents who have had to sit through "The Jungle Book 2" or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few to attempt an original story; Previous films were simply stories of existing stories. Movies such as "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." All do the same thing, but note that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney. The recent movies from Disney studios are mostly broadcast directly on video and are the sequel to an already successful movie. The quality of these films gives way to profitability. A new era began with "Atlantis", which followed "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and, more recently, "Open Range". The writers created all the original stories instead of the fairy tales of the past. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is dedicated to the quest for Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many hundreds of years. Including that of the young Milo Thatch, expressed by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed by a Washington DC museum. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had devoted his life to discovering Atlantis. This was perceived as a loss by his peers and they wish that Milo does not follow his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum's board of directors to sponsor his expedition, Milo returns home and finds a woman in his dark apartment. She takes him to his employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Milo's grandfather and wants to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and has paid the best of everything. The crew that must accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. The trip is filled with many obstacles and is very fun to watch. The viewer is trapped if he wants to reach Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, not just the discovery of people. Just keep the interest of the older audience. <br /> <br /> The animators did a remarkable job of deepening the animation. The film was very successful in mixing traditional animation with computer-generated images. A feat difficult to achieve, most audiences quickly noticing the difference. The characters are cruelly human. There are beautiful pursuit scenes, with a lot of action going on. Some lulls are filled with jokes that children may not understand. <br /> <br /> The creativity of writers is apparent. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Credible, if by a younger audience, this magic really exists. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not magically presented, but can be described as follows. <br /> <br /> Although defined in 1914, the level of technology used is not realistic. The trip takes place in a submarine reminiscent of Captain Nemo's nautilus, with subgroups firing torpedoes. The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers, so they tried to use vintage technology. Female characters are empowered in a way that women of age would not have been, even in leadership roles. This is not a bad thing. This gives a good model to my daughter, rather than an exclusively male distribution. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons this movie is my favorite compared to other Disney movies is that there is not a single song, already. A tradition that began with the first feature film, "Snow White", and continued until the movie "The Lion King". Almost all of Disney's movies are full of catchy songs. That's great and all, what would the Seven Dwarves be without "Hi HO!"? After the millionth time, it would be almost better without it, but it saves the parent. Not once, every person on the screen suddenly knows the words of a song that no one has ever heard before and starts to sing. For my part, I am grateful. <br /> <br /> The history and depth of the animation will not fail to catch the attention of parents and children. It's a movie that I'm ready to watch again and again with my kids.
