This sophisticated visual game presents "a story in a story". The protagonist is the screenwriter Bart Klever who fights persistently with his new text ?? which is, at the same time, the scenario of the film we are watching. In the film, Bart plays a screenwriter who writes the screenplay for the film. Bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, just like the environment of the apartment in which he works and cares for his little girl. The intimate environment offers many possibilities of illusion games involving space, light, colors and a couple of cats. The unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker's interventions, which appear on a computer screen and serve as a counterpoint to the similarly scalable environment, further complicate the apparently simple universe of the piece. The ever-changing viewpoint complicates the answers to the following questions: What is "truth" and what is "illusion"? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the others? Can anything serve as a basic point of orientation in the narrative space?
