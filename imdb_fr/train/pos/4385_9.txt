What can be said of a film that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic and sometimes most strange? I will not say "friendly". I will say "charismatic" villains in film history and the best sword fighting ever since. Flynn and Fairbanks were at their peak? It's an epic about a stubborn, sometimes stupid, incredibly brave and honest man who fights for his honor and freedom from tyranny. I liked it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were big bad guys. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender and sensual.
