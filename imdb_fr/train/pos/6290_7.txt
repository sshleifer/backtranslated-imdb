Using Buster Keaton at the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He was perhaps the most talented comedian of the silent age. This gives him a chance to deploy these talents in a little history of time travel. He finds himself with a guy living in modern times, and it becomes obvious that we are better left in our time, Keaton is able to make his gags. I already heard his voice. I think he did some of those Beach Party movies, playing empty characters just to earn a few dollars. Serling seemed to have respect for him and portrayed him that way. This is not a bad story. It shows how we react when we want something we do not have and we get that wish.
