When I first looked at this, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about three times. We just watch it again and I liked it MORE than I did last time! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about two dogs named Charlie and Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half gangster and half adorable, which I like. Itchy is his sidekick. Charlie is killed by his friend (PAS) and sent to paradise. When Charlie comes back to life, it's the beginning of an incredible adventure. <br /> <br /> The top five reasons why I am absolutely DIFFICULT about this movie: One: I like characters (except Carface). My three favorites are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie who arrives a little later. Two: I like the period of the story in which this movie is happening. This happens during prohibition in the United States. Three: The animation of Don Bluth (as usual) is superb. The funds are good too. Four: There is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this are beautiful. My favorite song begins with "I need Brazil, the thrill, the thrill" ... <br /> <br /> So watch this charming movie when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
