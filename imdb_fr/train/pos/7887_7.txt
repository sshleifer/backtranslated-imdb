If you are a fan of Freddy, you might not like it. This seems like a parody of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason he is standing is the story back on Freddy. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is always great in Nightmare is the death scenes. But the scenes of death were really nil. The visual effects were excellent and the acting was ok, but the story was excellent. Basically, Freddy's story is complete. <br /> <br /> I read bad reviews about it, but I liked it, despite its many flaws: <br /> <br /> 1. Freddy. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's death: the last nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A nightmare on Elm Street 4: the master of dreams. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A nightmare on Elm Street 3: The dream warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A nightmare on Elm Street 5: the dream child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you like the show. That's where Freddy explains himself, but that's it. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
