A sweet and funny story of two people crossing each other while preparing for their wedding. The former writer and public school teacher fall in love with each other in this beautiful New York setting, even if they marry other people. Perhaps a little mundane in that the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Nothing heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for the guys - sell the angle Natasha Henstridge and the girls - sell them shabby romance, everyone wins!
