I will be honest. I had this movie to make fun of it. I mean, come on, "Hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction could I have? The problem is that the film (and its directors) decided not to make fun of him. Instead, he would do his best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And you know what? It was very close. A little less cheese in casual music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting, props (like props - love the Best Buy bag) ... well, it's not a classic like the zombie movie, but it's still a pretty little movie all by itself. And the acting, writing and rhythm are surprisingly better than I expected. There is even decent humor, as two of our leaders discuss the question of whether a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the low budget (which leaves your fingerprints, alas) blasphemy almost constant, this can be a pretty fun time in the cinema. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the producers, the actors, the team, they all tried to make a good movie (instead of a camp classic) and that counts a lot. The campy zombies movie series is long, and thanks to you, guys, for not adding anything. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the Quiroz brothers. I would like to see what they do next. And hey, someone, give them a budget!
