It was a very daring film for his day. This could even be described as soft-core porn for the silent era. It was a walkie-talkie, but the dialogue was extremely limited and in German. In any case, we did not need it. <br /> <br /> The young (19) Hedy Lamarr is trapped in a loveless marriage with a haunting German (stereotype?) And, shortly after, a marriage apparently never consumed, returns at his dad's. <br /> <br /> In a famous and fun scene, she decides to dive into the skin one morning while her horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to run across a field that chases after leaving her clothes on the horse. An engineer retrieves his horse and returns his clothes - after having a crazy eye. <br /> <br /> They sit for a moment and, in a zen moment, he presents a flower with a bee on top. This is where she thinks about her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. She knows that this man is different. <br /> <br /> She goes home and ends up looking for our young man and finds ecstasy that has been denied. You can use your imagination here, but her head disappears and we see her bend with pleasure. As he never undressed, you can imagine ... Really, a tribute to the women of the director Gustav Machaty and a shock to the public of 1933. <br /> <br /> The only thing that ruins this film beautifully filmed excessive guilt and a strange ending.
