Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. In general, I do not go to the military / war cinema, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was also funny. The character of Beringer has been heroic and honest. Anyway, you know he supports you. <br /> <br /> Zane's character has developed throughout the film. It was not just a costume, he had clearly proven that he could be a hero and manipulate a gun. <br /> <br /> The end through me a little though. It did not really accompany the action throughout the film, but I'm happy to have seen it nonetheless. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out.
