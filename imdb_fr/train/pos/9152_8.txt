It's a good movie for 99% of the duration. I think the end of the film has been obscured by the latter. <br /> <br /> It was shot in a rather naive way. This is clearly done to create a more chilling sensation in the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very quickly through this filming technique. <br /> <br /> The macabre characters are very well played and presented, especially the 'nutcase' called Joe. However, healthy (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my taste - admittedly, they are supposed to be pathetic, but it's a bit like OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly (and the naive camera work smells a bit 'B' film at first) and very normally, but you'll soon have an idea of ​​the impending brutality that's about to occur. This is one of the most "twisted" movies about senseless violence. <br /> <br /> After the abrupt and incredibly lazy end, I felt disappointed. I would have given a 9 to the film if the end was consistent with the rest of the film, but as it is, it only gets a 7 on the strength of "serenity" and heartbreaking scenes earlier in the film. <Br /> <br /> Give him a watch and apologize for the end!
