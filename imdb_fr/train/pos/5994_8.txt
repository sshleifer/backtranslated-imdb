I had the pleasure of watching the director's short film "The Cure" for the first time, Ryan Jafri. What really impresses me is the work of the camera and the music. <br /> <br /> I think that a lot of young filmmakers (because I'm one myself) will experience difficult moments with cinematography when they start making an independent film. We find that the results do not exactly match what we imagined or below our ambitions. But this film, which debuted as a director of a young director, performed very well on screen. The movements of the camera, the color, the lighting, the composition all contribute to the story and emotion of the film. <br /> <br /> And music, as a key element of cinematographic language, is also very useful. <br /> <It is difficult to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short film. But I still have to admit that I'm not a fan of v / o (narration), especially when the movie is narrated, instead of shots and cuts. My personal feeling about the narrative part is, I guess, that the narrator tried a little too hard. So the energy keeps the audience from the emotion of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a short film well done, I could see the contribution of a director. Well done, Ryan! Hi from China, looking forward to your next. <br /> <br /> tim
