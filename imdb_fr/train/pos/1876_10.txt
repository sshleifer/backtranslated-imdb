An adaptation of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a struggling young sailor, Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant first performance by Derek Luke and a breathtaking performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing at so many levels and I was disappointed not to have won an Oscar, I think it's because it was released at a bad time, it's why he was neglected. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, you will be touched by its story and will make the audience more empathetic with this young man, Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like real and inspiring stories, then watch Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
