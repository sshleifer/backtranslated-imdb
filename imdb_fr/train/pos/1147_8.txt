Soapdish could be one of the most underrated films of all time. <br /> <br /> An awesome and selfless cast that understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles it played. While everyone was mastering it, there was no single bidding. Kline demonstrated wit and a great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey were able to conduct a fun conversation while someone spoke, I could continue. <br /> <br /> Do not skip this movie!
