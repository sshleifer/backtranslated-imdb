I saw a trailer about it on Afro Promo, the movie trailer collection featuring African Americans. It looked like what it is. A very tendentious "delusional" comedy in which a stuck black realizes that his son is gay. It seems that Redd Foxx's (RF) wife left him for his brother, who works with him at the Phoenix "store". He took the bus to visit his son, Norman, in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Then, as RF arrives, Norman, wearing a powder blue bikini, comes out of his waterbed to answer the door. Trying to gain time by forcing his elderly father to take the stairs to the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake up his lover, who firmly refuses to move. It was just at the point where I wrote "WHY will not he wake up?" when suddenly he does, and my friend's jaw and I fall for the first time many times when we discover our first glimpse of blue-eyed Garson and swirling hairstyle, Norman's white lover, who lived in white, who "had just the most dream faaaaaabulous ??" Garson is a fiery queen of a type that one can only imagine emerge from 1976 to LA. He has dresses, a handbag and clumsy big jewels, and seems to have shaped both his look and his personality on Brady Bunch's Carol Brady. <Br /> <br /> Norman orders his lover to find another home during his father's visit. Garson stays at Waylon Flowers and Madame answers the phone when Norman calls. <br /> <br /> Then RF tries to join his wife in Mexico. While he's on the phone, Garson comes in to tidy up his dress and RF confronts him. With an explosion of soul music from the 70s to evoke his nascent revelation (but more like that of a very special piece of The Emotions), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His The first impulse is "I'm going to kill him, I'm going to kill him." Then, RF takes a long walk in which he reviews all the thoughts a confused parent might have, such as "maybe we taught him to wash too soon." His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees during his walk, for example a beefy truck driver who appears just as he considers what makes a real man. Surprisingly, he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality. This, it must be said, represents about eight more pounds on homosexuality than what MY parents bought. He then goes directly to a park bench and reads them all! <br /> <br /> RF then hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazonian prostitute (in this incredible fur film) performed by Cleopatra Jones' Tamara Dobson. He hired her for Norman to experiment with heterosexuality, but it pisses him off and he decides to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Garson arrives and offers to go out RF for the night. He regrets the loss of RF's wife and tells the story of his own mother, who has an irrational prejudice against Pilippinos, because "she was assaulted at a luau". They attend a long-time representation of Wayon and Madam, culminating in a violent attack on the piano by Madame until her hair breaks off. Once again, the mouth was gaping. <br /> <br /> It seems that, you would not know, RF and Garson had a wonderful evening together! You see, older, calmer black men only have to see the lousy, effeminate mega-queer entertainment in order to move in ALL that the gay world has to offer! It really is that simple! That does not stop RF from shouting "Rape!" when Garson gets him out of a bad dream. This ends in a less predictable way than you thought. <br /> <br /> There were so many things that had just been done. WHAT is the basis of the relationship between Norman and Garson? They do not seem to have ANY report, and Norman does not hesitate to reject Garson, and even when he comes forward to defend himself, he never defends Garson or talks about their relationship. There was a kind of quaint touch like RF is going to buy all those books on homosexuality - and sit on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent is really trying to find something about homosexuality, rather than running away to get drunk or complaining with friends. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's kind of what it seems to be a bit: a little relic from a bygone era, a time in which some homosexuals thought that, if heterosexuals were stuck we could all learn to love and understand each other! And because of all the naivety of this case, the extreme stereotypes and the message-laden dialogue are a charming obsolete and fuel a lot of the discussion about how things have changed for gays over the past 30 years. I guess the only thing that seems shocking is the idea that friends of homosexuals are hopelessly in love and ready to drunk them so that they can be put to bed and, by extension, converted. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, check out Damn Cinema, my website about bad and nerdy movies (with some good movies released).
