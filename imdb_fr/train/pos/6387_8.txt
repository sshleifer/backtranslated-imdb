I thought this film was very well mounted. The voiceovers were also great. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was really worth the time and money to watch this. Atlantis has comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. It's a movie that any age can enjoy. From the moment that Milo is the mad "profesor" or until he has assembled the crew for the fantastic journey under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was good too, but the film puts better images in your mind. It's like the book. But go ahead, watch this movie!
