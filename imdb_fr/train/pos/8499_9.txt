A very entertaining film mixing East and West, influenced by the closure of the GM factory in Flint, Michigan, in the eighties and by the rise and integration of Japanese manufacturers in the United States. Located in western Pennsylvania, it features excellent performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music from blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
