I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for acting and dictating. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his role just as perfect. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was to replace the dictator against his will. But he has become more confident and comfortable with the role over time. Since everything is happening for a reason in life, I think he was forced to replace the dictator because he was supposed to stay there for more than a year. I guess he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in Parador. I think he took too much for granted in life and he needed a serious check of reality by staying in this country as long as he would have done. <br /> <br /> But ......... ..anyway ........... that's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.
