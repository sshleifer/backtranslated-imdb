Bunny Comes Home 'This Man's Navy' deserves more credit than ever, an intelligent scenario of Borden Chase, directed by 'Wild Bill' Wellman, the film has quite the sense for euphoria and goodwill the day after World War II, and no terror that came into play a few years later. Produced in 1944, the Japanese defeated, battle scenes a bit already seen, the melancholy appeal of Tom Drake for the radiant young Jan Clayton has a solid chemistry, plays truly and validates Drake's career at Metro. The following year, Jan opened on Broadway in "Carousel". Wally Beery, a little disgusted, boasts of a Jimmy Gleason still incredulous ?? his memories are an improvement over reality and give Beery a shadow to the Ulysses against which to play. The plans of the Lighter Than Air Navy are authentic, photographed in Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 Squadron is out of the air base in March. Lot 3 doubled for India and Bunny ?? Rabbit comes home ?? gives Beery an authentic slice of his past, something he had wanted to believe true ... ?? then, the future in which we shoot is fantasy ?? now on a larger scale, a newly designed Navy LTA with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance aircraft? how expensive, hopefully optimistic ?? still, "You have to believe it, that's how things become reality ??"
