He tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's the perfect B adventure of all time. It's actually a fun and fun adventure that, even with its faults, arouses your interest. It must have been the greatest movie of all time for those who did it. Although it was manufactured in the 90s, it does not look modern. He feels more like an old movie from Errol Flynn. The big adventure film is once again the essential thing in Hollywood but I fear that the feeling they feel is never the same as that of these old movies. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You can not hate him. I think it's a good adventure movie. And I really like the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.
