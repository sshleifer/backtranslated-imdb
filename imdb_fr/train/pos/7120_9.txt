Most wartime films made in the United States during the Second World War were very entertaining to watch, but unrealistic because they were produced for the sake of propaganda to awaken the spirits at home. I do not hit these movies because many of them are still very watchable. However, because they are so often lacking in realism, they can not really be great movies. John Garfield's film, Air Force, is a perfect example. A B-17 almost alone removes half of the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure - it scores points for telling a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. When I first saw this film, I thought it was NOT a true story, as it seemed too unlikely to be true. After further research, I found that it was in fact rather faithful to the astonishing story of two men who did so much to win the Medal of Honor. This is a case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!
