Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people were living at the time just for surfing. Their life was essentially about surfing, living, breathing and having fun. They did not care about money, jobs, girls or anything. For them, the waves were their daughters. I have never been on a surfboard, and it looks so hard, I do not understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense. It's a great movie and if you like surfing you should really watch this movie. If you are a surfer and want to know who started surfing, how it took shape, who is really famous or anything, then you should really see it. It may be a documentary, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
