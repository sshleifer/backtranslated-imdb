In order to prevent his homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from being sent back to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry her. The only other problem with this is that Stella herself is a lesbian. The two men have a separate life when one night after Albert's birthday party, they fall into a bed and then into love. Later in the film after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert of cheating and shows up for work one night after closing. What she finds will leave the viewer stunned. It's a very good film, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so talented in their roles that it's amazing that they have not been better known for their work here. Very controversial when released in 1978, the film rated "R" is now "PG" in a much more liberal era. <br /> <br /> Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a segment "Making Of" on the special features and in it is said that the film was based on a real story so that the viewers who say that the film is not "real" are wrong. Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love with different reasons. These are the questions explored in this wonderful movie for all those who have already loved!
