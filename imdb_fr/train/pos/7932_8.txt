When I watch a low budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect that the acting is not so good (budget reasons), I expect that the lighting is not as good (budget reasons) I expect that the sound does not not so good (budget again). Stop judging these low budget movies as a big budget movie !!! I am a filmmaker myself, so I understand the budget constraints of a low-budget film. Stealing places, shooting, etc ... the list goes on and on. I do not mean that all the acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is a natural. Not sold on Carl Washington yet. He must understand that each line is not important, some are throw lines. I say that if a film makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I liked this film. I gave him an 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Congratulations the Quiroz brothers!
