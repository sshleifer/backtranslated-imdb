Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, taking directors, editors and photographers very creative and working on historical themes, what the Japanese call "period pieces". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Bright, even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films provides a glimpse into traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but were not really explored in the epic of samurai from Kurosawa or the Zaitochi series. Onmyoji (2001) is another good example of this kind. I would place director Sogo Ichii among the most interesting and creative Japanese directors of the new wave. Other recent pieces from the Japanese period that I would highly recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's The Blind Swordsman (2003).
