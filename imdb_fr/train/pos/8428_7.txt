If it had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series, it could have been one of the best. It's pretty good, as most of them are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is particularly intriguing: farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (for once) and a samurai philosopher who creates a kind of barn; the two go against the usual local gangsters, who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances of taking land; their main or powerful ally is a Puritan who dies after drinking alcohol and gambling, but who secretly eats his own evil appetites. (He also looks like Dracula, as the villains of Zatoichi's latest movies do more and more often.) These characters are meaningful enough to deserve Zatoichi as originally designed, but he has now lost many of his nuances. , and the changes in some characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man killed by Zatoichi, need more time than the film has to give, so the story seems agitated, as if some scenes were missing. Apart from this, the film shows the virtues of most others in the series: a good interpretation, a sometimes lyrical photograph, the creation of a living landscape, credible and recognizable (whose absence is evident in the occasional episodes where the director is simply missing), and a technical quality that, by its nature, disguises itself: the varied and imaginative use of limited sets, so that their limitations do not seem to exist. And of course, there is the main actor, whose presence, as well as his performance, makes everything work. It must be one of the best-supported series in the film's history.
