I have never seen a show as successful as Full House. Full House shames all new shows! Anyone who has never seen it, which I do not see how it is possible, should see it. It's a great show for all ages. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will surprise you. It is true that some people think that there are aspects "cheesy" in the series, but the positive aspects weigh on all aspects "cheesy". Full House aired its first episode on September 22, 1987 entitled "Our very first show" and the last episode of May 23, 1995 titled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The plot of the show is very believable. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) loses his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pam's youngest brother, and Danny also brings his best friend, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier), to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are named DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse plan to settle with Danny and his three daughters for a few months just to help. and end up living with them for eight years; <br /> <br /> The following is a short description of some characters and the actor / actress who played it: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting for a big break. In Full House, John Stamos does a great job describing his character. He looked and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also an excellent actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. He must raise three girls without having the girl's mother. Bob Saget does a great job in describing a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three daughters. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): Dave Coulier can be described in a fun way. It is awesome. Playing Joey's character was perfect for him. He is doing a great job as a comedian waiting for his big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She's a great actress. She plays the older sister, DJ, who is the abbreviation of Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen. Her acting abilities in Full House were very believable. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (St√©phanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly incredible! I wish I could say everything I wanted to say about Jodie, but I would only use the maximum of 1,000 words. She debuted on a children's show called Mother Goose Stories and when she arrived at Full House, she dazzled the audience and the creator. Her superb appearance and tremendous acting ability have helped make this show the success it has been. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the series. It was supposed to be where she was going to take a break. Jodie, five years old when the series was first aired, could perfectly touch every line. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young children can not do this. As you can probably guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is their starting point. They were given the role of Michelle because they were the only babies not to cry in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> There are many more members of the cast who should be recognized. These are the original characters from the show's first performance in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is how Full House became The Michelle Show towards the end. I think it was to focus on her towards the end. Especially when I think that Jodie and Candice were much better to play. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. This can teach you a lot of things. One of the most important things she can teach you is that everyone can live a good life even if a tragedy, such as the loss of a family member, occurs. Full House continues to attract new fans. That said, there are only a few things left to say. Full House will never die, and thanks to everyone at Full House for giving everyone a show they can enjoy.
