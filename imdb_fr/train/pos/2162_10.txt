I was so surprised when I saw this film so underrated ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. His rhythm is slow, characteristic of Japanese films. Nevertheless, if you are absorbed in the film like me, you will find that it is not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I must say it's the best comedy I've ever seen. "Are we going Dansu?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood, for example Austin Powers or Scary Movies, where a gag is guaranteed every two minutes. It's pretty light, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I like the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is simple but enjoyable. I was so excited to see that Sugiyama (the lead role) found the meaning of life while dancing. Before watching the movie, I was a little depressed because of big school work. I felt lost. However, this film made me think of the good side of life. I thought I was in the same boat as Sugiyama; if he could find himself in his hobby, why not me? It reminded me to "explore my own future" and discover the happiness of my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. Some of you may find that the dance scenes are not as perfect as expected, but I like it because it gives me the impression that the characters are really "alive" and learn to dance with movie. <br /> <br /> This film is globally encouraging and comforting. As a comedy, he does his job perfectly. He certainly deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is funny :-D
