Personally, I really liked Cut. It was the first time I saw an Australian slasher film released in theaters. A genre normally reserved for traditional Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> With all the comedies and dramas cooking chefs coming out of Australia, I loved being able to see a local horror movie that is not a scam. I did not even think it was really a parody of other movies. It was a supernatural horror theme like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream or I know what you did last summer and so there was more a suspension of disbelief. I think it's time for Australian films to try to penetrate more into traditional genres. <br /> <br /> Cut was original, scary enough and finally a little fun. I would give him seven out of ten and I would not treat him as a serious problem He did what I wanted, entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying. I liked that.
