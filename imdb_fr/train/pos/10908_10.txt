I could not hold back my tears while watching this wonderful documentary. It was heartbreaking, disturbing and inspiring. I recommend this documentary to anyone looking for something that will make them think about what they do with their own lives. Or simply, something that will make you think. You watch John live the last two months of his life. You watch as he spends his days with a positive attitude. At some point, you begin to see that he is truly an extraordinary individual. You begin to understand that he has something to teach us all. Her life and struggles will make you cry, laugh and find that life is much easier if you take it one day at a time.
