Basically, the movie could be one of the most fascinating titles of either of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's clear things up, the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish thrillers to date. <br /> <br /> When it comes to tragic and disgruntled heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts form a perfect duo. This film and Deja Vu are better thrillers than you can expect. Washington was really comfortable with shaky cameras and all the scenes of the movie. One would be easily linked to the emotions of his character and therefore to all the massacres on the road. It's a success that they created a very dark city in Mexico City, with a lot of things to do. One would be easily convinced by the extent of the corruption described in Man On Fire. I do not know what the Mexicans would think when they look at this ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's look at the situation again. He is one of the best of the kind Death Wish, but he also suffered from intense violence. It's a little annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the film very realistic and leaving Denzel Washington embody the type of tragic hero "missing sheep". In the end, the kidnapper even shot in his own pool as a documentary. I checked on IMDb if the movie was based on real events for it ...... So it's your consideration if you also find that the theme of the film is a bit phony. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hope we do not take this film for real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for art direction / editing / cinematography / Denzel Washington.
