With everything happening in the world, we sometimes need an escape. Curly Sue, that's it. Not a complicated plot or deep meaning; However, it is not devoid of substance. It is not only the furious action or the dramas that make the heart beat. There are charming little shows that you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date. Try it, you may like it more than you think. The little girl is really smart and cute. The "daddy" and the girl follow slapstick routines. When a jealous boyfriend comes in, problems are getting ready for Curly and the life she knows can be torn apart. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play a leading role in the upper half of the world. Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable, like a duet describing homeless tramps on the street. Their worlds collide and the comedy follows.
