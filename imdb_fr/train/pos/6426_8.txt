One of the best "return Amitabh" movies that I liked. This was the phase where Govinda was getting strong with Dhawan. The songs were great and totally as we call them "type masti". An evergreen artist like Anupam Kher with many facets. The scenario has many hilarious twists, as evidenced by David Dhawan's bribes. With a timely appearance of Ms. Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, it was a total riot towards the end. It was great to see Amit play with so much strength and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I would watch it every day. I give it an easy 8 on 10 just to be pure Bollywood.
