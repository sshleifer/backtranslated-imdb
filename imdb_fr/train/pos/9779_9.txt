Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who go home but change in one way or another. In the first article, our former sect member is now in an insane asylum and receives a visit from a journalist who wants to know more about what happened in the sect. A little slow while the story is told in flashbacks while both are sitting on chairs and face each other. Reporter is particularly interested in what caused the death of the participants. What seemed rather boring suddenly becomes very exciting with a surprising twist in the story. Things get very bloody. <br /> <br /> Second story, a young violent criminal visits a psychiatrist for compulsory treatment. The patient seems to have a certain agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Again, things slow down a bit and get weird. Then there is a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising. <br /> <br /> The last story deals with the spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the disease from the person with his hands. One of the patients is a former member of the sect, which complicates healing. Once again, we are surprised by a twist. Has a pretty bloody scene inside. <br /> <br /> There is frontal female nudity as well as complete male facial nudity for some reason. I found the stories very well written and the director was perfectly able to set up each story with its surprising twist and its bloody consequences. <br /> <br /> Note: review of the German DVD.
