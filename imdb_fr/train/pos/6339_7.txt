The Grinch role was done for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed with his performance. Not being a big fan of him, I was worried but pleasantly surprised at the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou She was the cutest little girl I've seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years as an actress. I was even attracted by tears at one point! I never read Dr. Seuss's book, so I did not know what to expect, the humor was rather dark. Overall, I enjoyed the movie (aside from the songs!) And especially recommend it to family members.
