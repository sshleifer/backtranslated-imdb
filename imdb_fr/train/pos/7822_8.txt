It is sad to see this film now that we know how the ANC was caught by international capitalism. Biko is dead for nothing. Woods reaches little. Yes, apartheid has been abolished, but the entire apparatus of power has been reserved by minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less helpless. As Naomi Klein puts it in The Shock Doctrine, in the discussions between black and white leaders, "the Klerk government had a twofold strategy: first, drawing on Washington's ascending consensus, there was not only only one way of managing an economy, it described key sectors of economic decision-making - such as trade policy and the central bank - as "technical" or "administration", and then used a wide range of new policy instruments - international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs - to entrust the control of these centers of power to experts, economists and supposedly impartial managers of the IMF, the World Bank, GATT and of the National Party - anyone except the liberation fighters of the ANC.The statistical results are scary, little change has been made and AIDS in p Lein boom: Seeing Cry Freedom from this angle is deeply ironic, even tragic. The ANC went from the solution to the main problem.
