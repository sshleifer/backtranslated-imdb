IMDb mentions this as being 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen, including the excellent program notes, call it '68. It does not matter, except that it is very interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first works of art to merge the two apparently) in the context of the 2001 Star Gate sequence, broadcast the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and optically printed super-saturated colors and the psychedelic feeling of this series of flowers, Rohrschach spots, birds, and so on. It certainly helped to pave the way for many other nascent videographers in the 70s and deserves to be better known.
