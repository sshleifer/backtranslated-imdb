it is a treat for all fans of Bolan, some might think that this is a bit excessive, and it is only the ego of Ringo and Mark, but I think it is similar to any other concert video, except that it's Marc Bolan, not just any! I especially liked the video clip for the children of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip alone is worth all the money, I can not believe they did not release this version as a single. The film is really beautiful, especially for us, the danish. Now, I was not alive during the 70s, but the Danes in general were totally hurt by what was going on around them. At the time, the media, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, did not play nor broadcast popular music, they only played a bit with The Doors, but only really popular songs. so, I know of my father, that, seeing this, gives him back a part of his youth, he never had the chance to live it. <br /> <br /> I will not do this for too long, so ... If you are the least fan of Marc Bolan, you have to see it. you might find it boring or, as said before, a bit excessive. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians of all time, in action! <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappoints me a bit is that Ride A White Swan is not on the band. but I forgive him, because Jeepster and Get It On are played so wonderfully well.
