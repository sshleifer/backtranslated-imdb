The line, of course, is drawn from the Lord's prayer: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Sweden, especially its extreme north, is not my idea of ​​paradise. The winter temperatures are a little low for me, but the good people who live there think without a doubt that they are in the land of God. <br /> <br /> The story is familiar. An internationally renowned musician, Daniel suffers from mid-career health problems and returns to his small village in northern Sweden, where he was born. Persuaded by the local pastor to help with the church choir, he turns an unlikely talent into a class act and they participate in a competition held in Innsbruck, Austria. There are echoes (sorry) of the players of the group "Brassed Off", models of "Calendar Girls" and dancers of "The Full Monty". But of course, it causes a lot of emotional upheaval as some of the most disadvantaged villagers realize their value and revolt against their oppressors. He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing will stop him except death. <br /> <br /> Despite the rather old-fashioned story, we get to know and love many characters who present themselves as human beings. Rather than caricatures, although many of them are recognizable "types". I wondered if the female drummer had been unpunished for so long. Sweden is a country in the world where this violence is quite strongly discouraged (he was also a bit young one of the bullies of Daniel's youth) and the Puritan pastor with a secret passion for women's magazines was a bit stereotyped but beautifully directed by Niklas Falk. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is just as wonderful as Daniel, the frail but motivated musician, and there's good music too. I was delighted for the full two hours. The end is what you say, I suppose, but it does not spoil Daniel to do what he intended to do. .
