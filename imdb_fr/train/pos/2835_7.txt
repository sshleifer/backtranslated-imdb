Thank you to Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors for paying only $ 1.4 and enjoy as much fun as it is delicious. <br /> <br /> Adultery? As is common in modern times. Eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped Nick to sue Luis and Charlotte in Italy. She wants her revenge but in the end, she also commits the same crime as Luis: she had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small independent production, Vivian Naefe has dealt with the youth problems of modern marriage with a light heart. How can we dare to treat marriage seriously in this period of fast food where people now have greater mobility in the physical, mental and technological fields? The marital commitment demands a price too high that most people would choose to succumb to the circumstances. Once Nick trusted Charlotte, but he fell in love with Eva after this kidnapping trip which forced him to experience significant growth. <br /> <br /> Most viewers can feel happy about the end because greater reward for the unfaithful act of their spouses. However, I want a sequel, I want to see how the four would develop after this exchange. Perhaps they can exchange their return, how can we be so sure of the fragile love relationship? <br /> <br /> Good acting and good landscape. The two little children-actors should not be neglected, especially the crying boy at the reception of the hotel in Venice. And of course, how can we forget the landscape "Bella, Bella" of the city.
