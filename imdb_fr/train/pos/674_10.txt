It will be of little interest to most people to watch the film, but among the hundreds of movies dealing with magic and occultism in one form or another, this one is probably the best in many ways. <br /> From Golem to The Craft, the subject seems to be of endless interest to the film industry. Most of the films that touch him do so in a childish way (for example, "Witchboard", a real absolute abyss), either by taking the transcendent elements as cheap excuses for nerdy special effects or cardboard hooligans (cf " Warlock "). More frequently, the subject is approached in a hysterical religious context (in the different movies oriented on Revelations, the antichrist is inevitably the defender of a kind of practice of the new age style). Rarely, a film seems to show at least a passing experience of magic as practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such films can at best be described as allegorical and not literal, or symbolic, Or simply. not quite right. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after many years tonight. I had already seen it on VHS; it's a dark and gloomy piece, and after watching it on DVD, I would say that if you intend to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, do not watch it on VHS. <br /> <br /> Darkness and mood are dominant in the VHS format, but on DVD, the film takes on a very different tone. I think Weir deliberately pushed the dark aspects into the style, but when the film is converted to the lower VHS color, that goes beyond that. DVD brings the film to life and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, seeing it as if it was the first time, I realized that the treatment of magic is extremely effective in this film. It's hard to get into all the reasons why, I do not care to take the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious, anyway, if you want to see what it is in real life, this film is perfect for countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for all those who are not, you have really lost a lot of time reading at this stage.
