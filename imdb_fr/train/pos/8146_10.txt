I can not help but say how much I liked this movie. This film is one of the least known and funniest films I have ever seen. The film follows the exploits of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). This goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after its tragic breakup. Nina Blackburn, documentary filmmaker, follows the group. <br /> <br /> The film has a limited budget, but that does not seem to matter, it's a very well done and well produced film and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this film is writing, there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs on rap in this film, it's unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are takeoffs on current rappers, like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Cold Ice, Tone Def, Tastey Taste, and songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, Etc.) Rusty Condieff made a great movie. In the film, he plays the rapper Ice Cold. The film does not stop, it's funny from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The film works so well because it sometimes gets weird, but it hits that line where it's funny without going too far. Listening to the three main films to try to talk about some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the film, like Tone Def telling a record producer, "when you take the bus, you get there," and that the producer responds, ?? it's deep! '<br /> <br /> The group portraying NWH has some kind of natural chemistry for them. They work so well together and manage to shoot this film from where there is not a moment of a week in the film. What really makes this movie so good is its loyalty to some of the rap bands of the day. Many rap groups have had problems with violence and censorship and, like NWA, the group became popular only when the institution began to make much of the controversial words. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here to offend everyone in a joyful way. The film also took off from a lot of people outside of rap, the funniest being Spike Lee. Where they came with this dialogue, I can not imagine. The film has line after line that will make you roll on the ground. As I said before, the writing is excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this movie has had such a limited release. This is a smart, controversial and even provocative film. This is too much for the general public, despite the fact that it is hilarious and almost flawless in its production. There are no major stars, but many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, you will at least have an opinion about it.
