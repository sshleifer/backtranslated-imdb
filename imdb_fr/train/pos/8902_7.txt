I would imagine that if Steve McQueen knew that he would become an icon and that he would start "Wanted: Dead of Alive" the same year of the release of this film, or that he would be in The Magnificent Seven two years later he would not have done it. But he did it, and we are the richest. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a camp classic. The horror as it should be for the theater by car. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the last lines of the movie were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped him. Steve Andrews: Yes, as long as the Arctic stays cold. <br /> <br /> They would never have imagined 52 years ago that the Arctic would be melting. The blob will come back soon.
