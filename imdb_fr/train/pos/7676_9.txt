Brilliant! My wife and I joined Holly to attend Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the movie, I can understand why there was a long queue. Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people. She's a young girl, he's a used westerner. The film grabbed every bone of our body. There are no graphic scenes or things that are hard to look at - it's the surrealism of normality that really puts you to the test. The film is beautifully shot. Among other things, we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's brutality (I can not believe it's his first acting job) and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
