"Shore Leave" is basically an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode, though. I just think it's not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans. It's light entertainment, nothing more. However, I am pleased to see that such a television show has made enough sense to break with serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give free time to his team and a landing team is teleported to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems to be. There are moments of action and tension, but most of the story is played to laugh. Good, but not exceptional.
