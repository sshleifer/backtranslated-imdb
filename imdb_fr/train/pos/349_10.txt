Call me stupid, but I really loved the horror movie of 2001, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well done, well directed, etc.! Everything was wonderful! Some parts were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), completely awful and scary (Paige's death) and just heartbreaking (the first scene). I think that all the actors did a good job, especially the three main actors: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (whom I met and I autographed during the filming of this film - VERY nice people!), And Marley Shelton. <I'm tired of people calling this movie "another scream clone". This film is by no means a clone of Scream. In fact, this film revolves around Scream. This is really SENSE! Scream was NOT the only movie to contain a masked killer. Excuse me, but it looks like Scream was also a clone too (ahem ..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other horror movies also featuring masked killers). I also think that the novelty of the killer cupid mask is brilliant. It's so strange to see a sweet greedy face doing all those horrible things. Another novelty (the bleeding nose) gives way to a fantastic ending! The end gives me chills every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you did not like it the first time, look at Valentine again and give her another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Watch my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Be there soon...
