This film slipped through the cracks in the film's story. This is far better than some other New York movies of the same era, such as "The French Connection" or "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3". This film presents a cruel reality that also manages to use humor effectively to advance the plot. It is attractive from start to finish and has not faded with age, as is the case with the two examples above. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman plays bravery as a "Batman" and it's a pity his career did not do it. not take off as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directs and, as he does after "Shaft", he seems at first to be a strange choice. Yet this is the flip side of this previous effort and it has been tackled with as much force as machismo. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie was not made available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really has a jewel on their hands and it's a shame they do not do anything.
