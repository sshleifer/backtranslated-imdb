I thought it was a great movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me a bit was at first, when everything should have been normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about. Apart from that, the movie was very creative. I think that all the acting has been well done, the actors have perfectly interpreted the personality of their characters. All is well together. It's a shame that it's not a soundtrack. It would have been great! Because it's a Canadian movie and it's one of my favorite movies, I give it a 10 out of 10!
