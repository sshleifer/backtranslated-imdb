This episode of Columbo is probably best known to director Steven Spielberg as one of his first films. We need to look at the role of Jack Cassidy as a murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo. After all, Columbo meets his match in the character of Jack Cassidy. He is a mystery writer who plots to achieve the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the boring owner / widow of the general store who would make him sing for money. Rather than losing more money, he kills her. It's great fun to watch Cassidy and Falk, as always. Falk's familiarity when Columbo makes it visible after watching this episode several times over the years. What the television forgets today about the success of the years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters. It's not about who does it, how, or why, it's Columbo's familiarity and sympathy that pleases many viewers like me.
