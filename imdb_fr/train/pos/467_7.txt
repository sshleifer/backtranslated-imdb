This film is one of the few quality movies of 2000 and certainly one of my best. The scenario is based on Vladimir Nabokov's novel and the move to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is excellent, as is the acting of actors Turturro and Watson. Turturro undoubtedly gives its best performance so far, proving that it is worth far more than we thought. Watson also plays brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro) who is also extremely eccentric in his daily life. The film is presented in a nonlinear time, with multiple backtracking of Loujine's childhood. Through these, the complex character of Loujine is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, but to offer this film to anyone.
