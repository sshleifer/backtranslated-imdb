Adaptations on stage often have a major flaw. They often come out as if a camera were simply placed on the stage (like "Night Mother"). The management of Sidney Lumet keeps the film alive, which is even more difficult than the photo did not pose any challenge. Nevertheless, it is nice to watch for what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is pretty brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is as always fantastic and Reeve has one of his rare chances to play. <br /> <br /> I admit I have never seen Ira Levin's play, but I learn that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is faithful. The script is incredibly complicated and prevents you from guessing. "Deathtrap" is an extremely entertaining film, recommended to almost all fans of stage and cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
