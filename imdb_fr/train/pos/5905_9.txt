It's a really good movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made sense movies and this is my favorite movie by her. This film should have won the national award and would have been my choice to represent India at the Oscars. It's at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is going to the Indian Oscars this year. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the information about this (and all other Indian films) on IMDb is lacking and sometimes even bad. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this film and he is not even credited on these pages. The rest of the cast and crew are not mentioned at all. Rewards and nominations for this film are not given even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. "Doghi" has not been voted yet. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is not a film in Hindi. It is Marathi and, fortunately, he escapes the sequence of songs and dances, does not mix with glitzy glamor and designer dishes with a dark spirit. It's a real life, a moving story, made with rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> "Doghi", which can be roughly translated as "two women", is the story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. This is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many subsets, making it a very difficult film to make. The entire film takes place in a remote village of Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this one. <br /> <br /> The film begins and we are introduced to the whole house, which is preparing for the wedding of Gauri. The father of Gauri and Krishna being a hard-working farmer, the house is full and happy. there is nothing missing in their simple life. However, on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's future husband is the victim of a fatal accident. Gauri's father can not bear the tragic news and suffers a serious stroke. Without a strong and active member, the house could have collapsed, but Gauri's mother will take the responsibility. She works as and when she can, but can not make ends meet. But his life is even easier than Gauri's. Superstitions, which people try to forget without conviction, make Gauri a lucky charm. She is banned from society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes to her brother. Desperate, she accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri to Mumbai where she has to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives his life for that of his family. <br /> <br /> However, when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, his mother does not come to meet her. She does not allow Krishna to approach her and does not allow Gauri to stand in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but fears for Krishna's life. It completely breaks Gauri and she decides to resume her unhappy life. But Krishna runs and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to come back. Krishna promises to support her. Promises they would face the world ?? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that is not required in this film. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai but what she does there is never said ?? the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It's just the simple story, which is deep in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is a responsible cinema. It is respectful of the subject he is dealing with. It's respectful to its audience ?? he does not think they have the mental capacity of a four-year-old. <br /> <br /> The acting game is first rate. The direction is wonderful ?? silences advance the story in a way, no word could have. The scenario is well documented. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates good cinema loves "Doghi".
