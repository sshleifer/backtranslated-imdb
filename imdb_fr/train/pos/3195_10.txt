BEAVER TRILOGY is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films of all time. I had the chance to see him, with a Q & A session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a few years ago, and then bought a copy of Trent's website. This film must be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend looking for Trent's name on the web and then buying the movie on his site. He's an incredibly nice guy to start. Do not fool yourself: THE BEAVER TRILOGY fiction cameraman is NOT Trent! <br /> <br /> After seeing the TRILOGY a few times, I have to admit that I could probably do without Sean Penn Version. It's like a trial version of Crispin Glover's "Orkly Kid" section and is more interesting as an object of curiosity if you're a fan of Penn than a good video. Penn is pretty funny, though, and you can see the stuff of a big star in this black and white video. <br /> <br /> This is probably also one of the best roles of Crispin Glover and I would really like to see a documentary update on the original Groovin 'Gary. Once you've seen this movie, you'll never get Gary's nervous laughter again.
