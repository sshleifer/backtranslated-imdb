Sarah Silverman is like a totally crazy Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus, it's magic, you'll love it. If you have not done it, what is wrong with you? Congratulations to the comedy channel for putting it in my face. My life finally makes sense, and "Your car smells of farts" is my kind of humor. I am a happy guy. The first episode made me laugh hysterically and I can not wait for next week. It's like Grease is answering South Park. Completely outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book. Her delivery is accurate and so funny. She never skips a beat. When you think about it, it's not so much your choice of material. which is a very good thing, as it is the way she chooses to deliver it. Thank you Sarah Silverman! Thank you, Comedy Channel!
