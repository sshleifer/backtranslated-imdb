It made me think for days after seeing it. For me, it's the mark of a great movie. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of those people who need these Hollywood purposes. I plan to see him again tonight to understand the plot a little better - but no matter, the movie's emotional messages were totally felt.
