Another masterpiece of Woo! <br /> <br /> This is the best Wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - greatest director of the century. <br /> <br /> Maybe hi is not more intellectual than many great directors ... But it is a lyrical and spiritual idol of all people free of spirit! <br /> <br /> His films love great poetry! Woo is a Sheakspeare movie! Woo is a Biron movie! Woo is a Mozart of Bloodshet !!!! <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, WHO violent film is not a thirst for the blood of a director, but an instrument of art. The themes of Woo movies are more humanistic than those of new movies.
