I do not doubt that critics have criticized this film, especially the artistic artists who need a laxative. This is an excellent vehicle film in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It will not shake the world and will not change movies forever. What he's going to do is entertain. When everything is said and done, it is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget your worries. He even has a simple and kind moral message at no additional cost. I always liked Elvira's TV show when I lived in Los Angeles. She did not really steal her cat in Vampira, nor did Vampira to the original, Theda Bara. This kind of mythical character belongs to the one who does it best; & Cassandra Peterson does it better. Long live Elvira we need more of this kind of movies. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He exudes a wonderful refined malice. I did not find any technical faults. The execution is as irreproachable as art. My deepest compliments to the director, James Signorelli, and to all his crew.
