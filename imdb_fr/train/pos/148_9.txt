Like his previous film, "In a Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga creates an intense and very poetic canvas, even more visually refined than his predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting images we can see. The exacerbated drama, the intensity and the nuance of the violence threaten the melodramatic or the farce, without ever entering it. In this way, he achieves an almost impossible feat: to be so exaggerated and painfully restrained, to be so loaded and so understated, and even the finals of explosives are virtuous feasts of the eye. Unabashed, beautiful and very tense ... this film is simply superb!
