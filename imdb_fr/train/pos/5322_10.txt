A real dark film noir and a very graphic film, beautiful plot of a man in search of redemption, which may be too late. Visually, there are some very beautiful, artistically astonishing scenes about what can be done with a minimal budget. Congratulations to Gareth Maxwell Roberts and his team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, but I hope more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray was delighted not to have seen her before and hopes to see her again in the future. Submit all interesting Sex, Drugs and Violence. Bring it on. I would definitely say to rent this one and check if you are in the mood for a dark black.
