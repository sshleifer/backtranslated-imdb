It's not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most people I know would not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a portrait of the cruelty to body and mind that happens pretty much in a war, the characters seem plausible, especially because you "read their thoughts", something that we find more often in books and rarely in movies, but that is very well done in this piece. I would place it next to "Everything is calm on the Western front" and "Die Br√ºcke" to leave a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could project it to school, with the two other films - However, finding a copy has proved quite difficult - which is a shame.
