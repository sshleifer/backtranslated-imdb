If you played "Spider-Man" on the PS version, you've seen it all. To really experience it, you should get the DC version. In simple terms, it is a game that is much better on a graphic level; the textures are clear, the levels are easy to navigate and the sound is much better than the cousin of the PS. I bought this game in the late 2000s and it still holds today. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a superior and strategic game, but if you're a fan of Web Head, you have to pick it up for your game library yourself. Going around the city as Spidey has never been so beautiful and flawless in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, hang it for cheap. The DC version is simply amazing.
