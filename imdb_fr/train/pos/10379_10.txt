The Plato series is a fun movie with Gary Busey. It's a pretty unknown film. So I saw him in a safe. I thought it sounded funny. George Busey embodies Plato a hard mercenary who is prepared for assassination. of a powerful Cuban crime lord currently on the run, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends, played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). What I liked about Plato's race was the way the movie was never boring. The plot may have been done before, but it was always good to play the theater. It was fun to watch and the action was also very fun, especially the highlight. Since he normally plays the villain and Steve Bauer is good, the same Plato's teammate Jeff Speaksman does a good performance and he can not even play well to finish the Plato series is a nice effort on the part of naked image films and I give it 7 out of 10
