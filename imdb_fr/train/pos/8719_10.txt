I was surprised by the improvements made to an animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see details in the grass and surface structures. Details, colors and shadows are at least an order of magnitude greater than Toy Story. How they managed to shade, I'll never know. I hope PIXAR will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so that I can find out how it was done. On the basis of this film, I think that the animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film.
