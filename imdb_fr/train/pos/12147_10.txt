Return To The 3th Chamber is the humorous sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin, in which Gordon Liu played the role of Shan Te, a young man who became a great monk and fighter. In this sequel, Liu plays the role of an unfortunate loser who must learn kung fu after beating his friends. He imitates the original Shan Te, tries all sorts of tricks to learn in the Shaolin Temple and eventually gains unique skills to fight some intimidating bosses. It is a classic and light martial arts tale, with the production values ​​of the Shaw Brothers ace and the assured leadership of Lui Chia Liang. The choreography is fantastic, whether it's fights or crazy comedy movies and Gordon Liu's performances, as are the others, especially the sympathetic monk, who works perfectly for the material. The film is less epic or deeper than some of the other stars and there are certainly larger, more violent and more radical films. But few people have such a magical blend of slapstick, training, and unique battles, with the subtle and comforting story of a useless guy doing good. Full of joy, it is impossible not to give him the highest score.
