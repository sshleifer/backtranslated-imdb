A Pentagon scientific team seems to have developed a serum that causes invisibility, but when the leader tries it himself, he can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk with power, he becomes psychotic in the classic HG Wells tradition. <br /> <br /> It's an absolutely horrible story, Invisible Man, delivered with taste by the always good taste Verhoeven and Bacon as a genius transformed into loonytoon-maniac. Like much of Verhoeven's work, he has a tremendous unrestrained sense of the Boy's-Own comic book adventure (the secret underground lab where the scientists' work is simply fantastic), combined with the most horrific visuals and depraved (women dressed in underclothing and attacked by an invisible demon, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood and mass slaughters in the last two reels). Although the story does not bring about any change in an old idea, the CG special effects of Scott E. Anderson are incredibly brilliant because we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and the flesh of nowhere. In particular, a sequence in which the team brings back a gorilla from the invisible state and the scene where Bacon drowns Devane in a pool are breathtaking in the details and the artistic invention of the effects. The film also has an excellent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror film photographs by Jost Vacano. The young cast is almost eclipsed by the film's technical pedigree, but Shue and Dickens are impressive. It's a very funny and nasty movie.
