Wow, I forgot how awesome this movie was until I stumbled across it looking through the garage. It's kind of a strange combination of a Michael Jackson biography, a collection of music vignettes and a story about a superhero fighting to save little kids. The thumbnails are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot and finally a spaceship (and it's also strange as it may seem). Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has enough cool pictures and good music to entertain! <br /> <br /> But the real gem is the amazing "Smooth Criminal" video, which makes the movie worth selling for this part only!
