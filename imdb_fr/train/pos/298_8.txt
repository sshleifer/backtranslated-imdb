New York has never been so beautiful! And nobody either in this movie. Although the script is a little light, you can not help but love this movie or one of its characters. You almost want people like this to exist It's really the attraction of the actors (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten are particularly talented.) Rent or buy this movie, you'll be happy to have done .
