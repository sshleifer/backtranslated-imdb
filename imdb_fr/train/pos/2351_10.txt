First, I would like to point out that the average user's inability to appreciate the imagination is appalling. What makes this show so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. You do not have to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead, or why it can only last a minute. Where is the wonder of the whimsical stories of childhood, a bit like A Wrinkle in Time. <br /> <br /> I say it's refreshing to original, because it's an extreme opposite to the mass of televisions that do not leave no room for imagination or wonders. <br /> <br /> It's nice to add a bit of escape to the TV experience. <br /> <br /> Hyper-reality is my favorite part of the show. The decor of the 50s, the innocent and rare characters, as well as the landscapes and the physical scenery that should not be considered as a pure reality. <br /> <br /> This show masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. While entertaining, other television shows have relegated the series to the background. This has truly restored curiosity, imagination and wonder on television. <br /> <br /> Pushing daisies quickly came to the top of my list.
