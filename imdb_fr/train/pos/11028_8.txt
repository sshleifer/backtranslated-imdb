To be honest, I did not really like this movie when I first saw it. But I guess the problem is that I did not see him in a theater. Big mistake ! Because the # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and the 2, cinematography. Try to see this film on the largest TV possible and on an excellent audio system. The music is good and puts the film at a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see him, the more I love him. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of Renny Harlin's best movies. This guy is aware of the action. Die Hard 2, the long kiss goodbye, etc. And that's particularly good in this movie. The special effects are great and spectacular. Stallone really needed this movie to come back successfully. Still good to see it!
