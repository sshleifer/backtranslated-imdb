A good idea of ​​"race against time" - John Doe murdered at the pneumonic plague. While the health authority and the NOPD are struggling to find their contacts at the water's edge, the murderers believe that the heat comes from the infected cousin of the victim. hold on them. <br /> <br /> This film is available free on the Internet Archive and deserves download. Many (all?) Of this film were shot in real film locations in New Orleans, which makes it interesting to watch for what is now the detail of the period, although for me it seems underexposed even for black - maybe mobile lighting fixtures then were not what they are. There is also a lot of background noise, which is a little embarrassing: car horns in the love scene, you tempted? There are many non-professional support artists in the crowd scenes, and this may explain why the film's rhythm is slightly fuzzy at first - there is not much chance of recovery or redesign, although the Final pursuit is worth hanging. There is not much wrong with the main actors either: Jack Palance is truly frightening as a charismatic and intelligent psychopath - the next scene as he comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrible, while Widmark, as he often did, throws the righteous anger of the man on mission to a credible level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should do this again - no supernatural, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good thread full of character conflicts and a topical theme. Another critic mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's what happens with the number of odd types of New Orleans that dye this dark and shady drama against the clock. There is even a dwarven newspaper seller. <br /> <br /> "A community? What community do you think you live in the Middle Ages?"
