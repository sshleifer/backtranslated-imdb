This highly underrated movie is (for me) what a good writing in a movie is. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and exposes it so that everyone can see it and question it. The film talks about the divisions people create to isolate themselves from the violence, hatred and fanaticism of everyday life. <br /> <br /> All along the way, we are asked questions after question about life. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself: "Am I making a violent film (and by extension, our pleasure to see it) is the cause of violence in society?" Claire asks "What kind of world is throwing something as precious as a human life?" Mack is not immune to the question "Is it possible to go beyond the limits of race and finances (even more difficult)? These are of course not sentences of the film, but generalities. others also ask their questions, and to be honest he raises more than he answers. <br /> <br /> But it's the nature of life.We strive all our lives to find answers to the questions to which we will never respond fully, and in some cases we need to provide appropriate responses to our As humans, we thrive on questions we can not answer, some answers are real, Claire and Mack come to to realize that even if they could take the easy way and let the state take the baby in their place, their responsibility their life in their hands.Some answers are not. Davis 'sees the light' and decides not to not make violent movies, my The next day turns around and rejects his epiphany as subordinate to his art. <br /> <br /> We all seek answers. This film does not answer them, it simply reminds you to keep looking for answers. <br /> <br />
