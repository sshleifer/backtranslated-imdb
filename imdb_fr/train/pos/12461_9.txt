A clever scenario of the fiery SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and the intelligent performances of the two main men - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or if it was the other way around) - result in an engaging and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to Over the competent direction of the veteran JEAN HERMAN and the simple but effective score of FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it is easy to understand why this film has a strange and timeless quality. <br /> <br /> It's a boyfriend or sticker with two lonely, disillusioned and exhausted world, coming back, presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of that time (after the Second World War, in the 1960s), France had had trouble keeping up appearances overseas. Losing Algiers was a blow. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL The FRIEND (the original title) tells the actions of our two (anti) heroes who struggle to get out of it, after their release. <BR/> <br /> Things follow each other, and the viewer must be very careful, because JAPRISOT is simple and economical with his scenario: if he is there, there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that these two men compete physically and psychologically for a long weekend. Their motivation is very different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different on the outside: the first, undoubtedly a pretty boy, and the second, an ugly thug, adds to the chemistry. <br /> <br /> This quest forms a beautiful story, which in turn makes an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> For fear of forgetting the women in this film and, faithful to the Japrisot method, they are also memorable, although not so rich; to say more, it would spoil our pleasure to discover their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREND, A FRIEND IS RELEASED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVED; EN English ONLY (not even subtitles for the hearing impaired); AN OPERATING TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK but the music of ROUBAIX has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
