This film does not go well with some, but it is a must see. I'm glad someone finally came up to discuss the realities of how African-American couples worked to make a name for themselves in communities and how many of them felt they were trying to stay there then that "other" African-Americans were settling down. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little movie from Showtime is almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African-American man (Danny Glover) who worked hard through the positions traditionally 1970s Like any American, he moved his family to be compatible with its increasingly mobile status but forgot, there were still many problems. The only Afro-Americans in the neighborhood at the time were the maids. A homeowner? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then, the assembly started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is invited to "get involved" to do what all the other women in his neighborhood do. And just when the man thinks that his family and he are "in", right next door, another African-American came in because they won the "Lotto" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes and he does not want to have anything to do with them. because he does not want the neighborhood to think they are alike. Of course, he is of a better caliber, his new neighbor is "ghetto" and should not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this movie shows you is the great pain it takes for this family to integrate, and how it gets lost in the process. This brings you to where racism begins and ends ... and with whom. It shows that no matter what your color and your money, you can always isolate yourself from the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African-American children, when they "mix" in such neighborhoods, fall into the trap of changing to match the culture (with blond hair and blue eyes, notice it!). They laugh at the same time as the jokes, not knowing that they are joking and do not know ... why. <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie is about "people". Whatever your race, this movie shows how terrible you can be to your neighbor and to each other ... just to fit in. Just because you feel you have more money than the others, which automatically makes you better - and you forget the struggles you've had and the ones that are rising up behind you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
