My constant love for Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped revive my puberty with her performance in "Thunderball" in 1965, led me to quite unusual places. For example, this British curiosity of 1959, "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.", stars Lucianna in one of his previous roles. She plays a princess in this one, although the photo is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, whose two stars were certainly on the rise at this stage. In this cute and often funny film, we discover Gaillardia, a Madeira island, which was a British colony until 1916 and was then universally forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, he becomes the center of global attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there, and his Majesty sends the Carlton-Browne hangman to the Foreign Office to take over. Terry-Thomas underestimated this part, as did Sellers in his role as Prime Minister Amphibulos of the small country. (This was Sellers' second film in 1959 about a tiny country that associates the spirit with the world, the other being "The roaring mouse", of course.) Ian Bannen almost steals the show here as the sweet king of Gaillardia, and my daughter Lucianna is as attractive as possible in her minor role. The film has a lot of very dry humor, although there are some belly laughs (the reception at Gaillarde airport, for example, and especially the parade of strength Gaillarde May Day). And the shabby prime minister of Sellers, with his torn English and seemingly perpetual sweat stains, is another memorable figure in this great actor's pantheon. Despite a few cases of indecipherable and rigid British mumbo jumbo, I found this picture to be a very modest entertainment, and well presented on this Anchor Bay DVD.
