Best show since Seinfeld. She is really funny. His total selfishness, his gay and imposing stoner neighbors, his departures in songs or cartoons make it the coolest show on television. One of the few shows I want to watch. The scene with the old black lady of the pharmacy ("Oh, wait now that you are close, you look old" turn the face with the finger and go away lol), the overdose of cough syrup , sleeping with God, it's so funny or so stupid that it's just a lot of fun. The weak points of the series are his sister and the policeman only because they are too normal !! I really can not wait until the next show, something I have not felt for a long time.
