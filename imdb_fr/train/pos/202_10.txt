A Give this film a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time, Walter Matthau and George Burns, collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors of the movie + director Herbert Ross, and all this makes this adaptation on stage real. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best movies of the 70's. I like the kind of humor in this movie, it makes me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> I had this film on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper - only 3 dollars). I watched it as soon as I got home, but I had to watch it again because I was missing a few more passages the first time. The second time, I felt a lot better and laughed a lot. I will definitely re-obtain this on DVD because I have to see the special features. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how it goes. Two people work together as performing artists / actors / performers. They get along well on stage but really talk off the stage, they can not survive another minute, and then 15 years later, you want to put them together for a special show. You can find this in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. It's a pity they're dead. George Burns deserved this Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 years old when this film was shot. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive an academic award at an advanced age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this regard. He won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. He deserved this Golden Globe. Although many people may disagree with what I am going to say, everyone in this movie has presented a solid performance. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: The one who hates this movie is a "Putz"
