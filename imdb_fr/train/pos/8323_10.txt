"A little nonsense from time to time, is cherished by the wisest men." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful boiling, wonderful place, period piece made with attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just wonderful! <br /> <br /> Praise him, sit down, relax, take him, smile a little. Have fun. <br /> <br /> So thank you for thanking me.
