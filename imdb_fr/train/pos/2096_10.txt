With the advent of IMDb, this neglected movie can now find an interested audience. Why? Because users here who are researching two-time Academy Award-winning Glenda Jackson can find "The Soldier's Return" among his credits. So can those who seek the winner of an Oscar Julie Christie. Ann-Margret fans can give a click to the title, as well as those interested in the career of the great Alan Bates. Not to mention the extra bonus of a movie with heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay. Any film containing so many notable is rewarded by the IMDb, considering all the referrals happening here. So why did not this movie come out on DVD? Do not producers realize that the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a movie? And "The Return of the Soldier" is definitely a jewel to discover. Get with that, people.
