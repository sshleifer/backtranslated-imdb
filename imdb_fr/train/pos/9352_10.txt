Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It sounds like a loss story, when it's all about being alone. Some people may never feel alone at this level. <br /> <br /> The Cheadles character, Johnson, reflects the opposite of Sandlers' character, Fineman. Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman was trying to forget his life from the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and Sandler brings tears to the eyes. Cheadle was a comedian and a great supporter of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see Oscars somewhere here. A very good movie. If you've already lost and felt lonely, this movie will make sure you're not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
