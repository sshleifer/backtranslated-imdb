This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce - which is obvious, and I say it as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is courted by a wealthy Argentinian (Roland), who asks her father to marry her. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived by plane and immediately launches into an audience-driven reminiscence about the last time Caroline decided she was in love with someone from other: a dilettante sculptor (Gardiner). The film tells the story of Anthony's strategy by dissociating Caroline from his sculptor and how this experience helps him to help his Argentine. <br /> <br /> It is perfectly interpreted: Ronald Colman is at his most sophisticated and charming, Reginald Gardiner is at its height, Gilbert Roland is his exoticism and Anna Lee is deliciously whimsical. The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production looks like a work of love. There are wonderful touches, such as breaking the Colman frame and speaking to the camera, and the exceptional use of a sliding cabinet door. It's a sin not to have it out on DVD - it's the kind of film that alone can spark interest in the classic movie.
