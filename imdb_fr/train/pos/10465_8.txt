Even at the very beginning of her career, Capra was very accomplished with her work as a photographer and her timing. It's a thin story - and quite predictable sometimes - but it's got very good performances from its cast and has some rather complex camera movements that intimately involve the viewer. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, although all the brains can see that the bottom will escape - the rich "prince" will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, thanks to its good distribution and the fast pace, it is easy to be caught in the clich√©s. Then the film becomes more original because the married couple has to find a way to make a living. The end is very predictable but satisfying. I also want to compliment the writing of the title: very witty and fun.
