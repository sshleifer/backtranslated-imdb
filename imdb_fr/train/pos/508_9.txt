In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer fired his plasma rifle at Klingon Klaang after a methane store explosion and Klingon was sent to Starfleet Hospital. Ambassador Vulcain Soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring Klaang's body into his warrior empire on planet Kronos with honor. However, Captain Jonathan Archer proposes to accompany the Enterprise on his first voyage and bring Klaang alive on his home planet.

T'Pol modifies the Enterprise's sensors to track the Suliban spacecraft until it reaches the Riger X planet. They investigate and reveal that Klaang was a courier, bringing Klingon leaders an important message about the war Temporal cold of Suliban Sarin. in Kronos. <br /> <br /> Despite being a big fan of Star Trek, I did not follow the episodes of Enterprise on cable TV. I decided to buy the DVD box of the first season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first company, Captain Jonathan Archer, the superb T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip is excellent, at least in this pilot project. I noted in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD, they are only one, so my criticism is valid for both. I did not like the theme of the score, which I found very annoying, but it was an exception in this great show. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
