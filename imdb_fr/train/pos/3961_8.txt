This is the magnum opus of the Swedish king of shit, Mats-Helge Olsson. It is rare that a film of this magnitude was shot in Sweden and it really stands out as one of the most amazing achievements of the Swedish film to date. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to go to Sweden. But his plans are ruined by the Russian army who kidnaps him and tells him he has arrived in Sweden. This trickery is their way of seeing that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply of the entire planet. The CIA is however determined to get Markov in the west and send his ninja to free him. <br /> <br /> Mats-Helge has perfected the practice of making Swedish actors speak English. The cheap b-movie sensation that this creates is probably incomparable in terms of performance. Aside from that? Well, the action is a standard direct-to-video style. Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians are dying. People lying in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> What really stands out is the incredibly poor way in which the battle scenes are choreographed. When they say "Ninja" in the title, I expect martial arts, I expect a close fight. But there may be two or three martial arts scenes in this film. And they are hilarious. It's so bad that I miss the words to describe it. If the ninjas moved more slowly, their hearts would stop. And of course, the whole movie ends with an explosion that indicates a special effects budget consisting of four food coupons and a McDonald's voucher. <br /> <br /> So what's the verdict? Classic moment of course. Never before has a movie been designed to be consumed with a huge amount of alcohol. It's the ultimate party movie. Insert in the video and laugh. Just realize that such films are no longer made. This is the story of the film. <br /> <br /> The rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
