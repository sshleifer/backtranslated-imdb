I am really shocked to see the number of reviews lambaste this movie. This film was not meant to be a film of "deep thought", that's what the vast majority of critics seem to think. In fact, it would seem that if NO film produced a glimpse of life's life-changing life, or a bewildering, twisted, and bewildering plot, it would score 1 or 2. Do not destroy a movie because you do not like it the kind, the people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy movie, and that's all it was meant to be. And for an action / comedy, it was very well done. In fact, I was quite surprised to enjoy it as much as I liked, having never been a fan of Jamie Foxx, and having the over-used plot he has. <br /> <br /> The plot is not spectacular, it has the typical criminal out of prison and is thrown into a conspiracy plot while trying to get rid of his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk , 48 hours, etc. etc.), but it was warmed up with a bit of a technological touch. Now, the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the TRUE "bad guy" is an ultra-geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays a funny humor, while being quite intelligent and serious, and not trying to overload the humor side of the film. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep underlying plot such as "The Matrix" or a drama such as "Of Mice and Men" then this movie is not for you. But if you like raw action, excellent fast-paced shooting and a touch of casual humor, this movie will not disappoint you. I would have normally rated it at about 8 (at the same level as the Die Hard trilogy), but I gave it a 10 instead to try to bring the score down to what it SHOULD be. <br /> <br />
