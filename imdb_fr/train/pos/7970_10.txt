This film is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The voices of animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox both shine as an impertinent feline and inexperienced young dog, but Don Ameche truly stands out as an old and faithful golden retriever. This film is a very good family film because it can be appreciated and loved by both children and adults. Humorous and full of suspense, and guaranteed to make all animal lovers cry! (tears of joy!)
