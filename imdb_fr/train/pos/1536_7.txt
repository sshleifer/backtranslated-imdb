The more the drama is tightening, the better is the film of rivalry between sisters! This little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy when it was released in Sweden. It is certainly possible to have fun on the quarrels of small towns, but the drama occupies a central place as the story progresses. And not just the family drama, it also raises poignant questions about respecting differences in people's lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> A beautiful set of characters with many dramatic and moving dramatic scenes that yield credibility points; and they are not just scattered, but hold everything in place. This suggests to me that if Ingmar Bergman had done that (the drama would suit him!), International attention would probably have been immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.
