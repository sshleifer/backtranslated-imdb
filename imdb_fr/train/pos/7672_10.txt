I must admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the Festival's Artistic Director specifically recommended this film to an audience of more than 200 people before the screening of another film, I decided to go see him. Wow! <br /> <br /> This film deals with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does it without any compromise. I found myself crying a few times during the movie and laughing at others. Talk about emotional roller coasters. <br /> <br /> The lead actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (who was just 14 years old at the time of shooting) and had to tackle this incredibly complex and difficult role. She reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes from Whale Rider, but the role here is much more demanding because she has to play the role of a child prostitute. It is likely that she won many prizes. <br /> <br /> The main story is that of a girl who was sold to prostitution by her family and was held as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a dramatic role that we are not used to seeing), who, after spending time with her, decides to help her. However, at that moment, she is sold again and he searches for her throughout Cambodia. The story turns, and the public can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The action has been strong in all areas with a very interesting international distribution. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist), Virgine Ledoyen (emotional as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of her latest films). The Asian cast was also superb. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult subject, it is successfully trying to tell a compelling and compelling story. It was shot in Cambodia (some scenes in real brothels), which adds to the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary. It seems that the DP has used a lot of portable cameras and close-ups and that in general, it gives the impression of being at the center of the story. <br /> <br /> After the screening, I listened to other members of the audience when they left and it seemed they were all stunned. This film is not easy to watch and I salute the filmmakers for not having shot a "Hollywood movie". <br /> <br /> This is by far the best film I've seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Opinion shared by my husband and some other friends.
