I first bought this DVD because SRK and Aishwarya Rai were on the cover and I thought, hey! another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, I did not know that Aishwarya would only appear under an article number in the last quarter of the film, in a song she shares with SRK and helps introduce her character who is in the movie for just 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about the love and endurance of a mother. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, the transition to adulthood, to enter into knowledge and to embrace the harsh realities of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the movie. It's actually a dream sequence that happens when the drunk character of SRK is stunned by alcohol. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who comes one day to his favorite place, dressed in a light outfit and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is "Ishq Kamina" (roughly translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's just smoking hot! Do not miss it.
