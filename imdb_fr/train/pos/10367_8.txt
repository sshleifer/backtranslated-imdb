When I saw for the first time "A cry in the dark," I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw him, I was shocked by what he portrays. When I saw him a second time in an Australian cinema class, I realized a second point: communication problems. You see, when a dingo caught Lindy Chamberlain's baby (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were saddened but did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, they believed that God wanted it to happen and they could not cry it. But when people across Australia saw their lack of sadness, everyone started to believe that Lindy had done it herself. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the wrong message was communicated to the public and people turned to Lindy. Even if it was a pure accident, it always happened. This is perhaps one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of the political views of the media. <br /> <br /> Regarding performances, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there), and Sam Neill is just as great. You will probably be blown away by what you see here. One of the best films of Fred Schepisi.
