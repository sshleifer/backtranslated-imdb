I was looking at this when my wife called to inquire with the other room about my choice of fare. My comment? "I look at my life!" <br /> <br /> Although younger, but only about 5 years old, than the "Rocket Boys", I remember the absolute urgency with which our education administrators welcomed Sputnick all the scientific fair grew and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind. My own tornado landed at the Science Fair of my own state, in Physics by '62, although our group was less successful in getting support, for example, from the firefighters we sought for advice and advice until after a tragic event, our city far from allowing us to visit the Nike missile site on the shores of Lake Chicago. <br /> <br /> This film brought everything back to me and I bet it brought everything back to us "UberNerds" from the late 50s and early 60s. <br /> <br /> We are in a similar period of scientific brain drainage and really need this film as a country. To see him!
