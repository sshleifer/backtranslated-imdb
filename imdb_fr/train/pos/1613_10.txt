This film is always a favorite of all time. Only a pretentious and humorless idiot would not appreciate this wonderful movie. This film looks like a piece of hot apple pie topped with French vanilla ice cream! I think it's Cher's best work and his most credible performance. Dear has always been blessed with charisma, beauty and a slim and enviable figure. Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made its mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have disappeared. She is one of the most unique artists on the market. It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as a naturally talented actress? She is the head above the so-called "stars" of today's movie. Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, as she never seems to be an "actress", she really becomes the convincing character. She has more than deserved the respect of her peers and the public who go to the movies. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - characters, landscapes, dialogues, food. I do not get tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at the scene where they are all sitting around the table at Rose's, I pause in the remote to see exactly what Rose's delicious food is. portion. I saw spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can not say if they eat ravioli, ziti? What is this main dish? It's beautiful and it drives me crazy! <br /> <br /> All members of the family were hardworking people who respected each other and cared for each other. The grandfather was not put aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be also an old, fairly healthy and independent coder. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother was not "just a housewife", she was the glue that kept the family together and was a typical example of what a woman is. , mother and house manager should aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen, but she did not let him define who she was. The very powerful businessmen are not as comfortable as Rose Casterini. Notice how insolent she talked about "I did not have children until I was 37. It's not over until it's over." You have the impression that she is the kind of young woman who acted exactly as she pleased and managed without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, quick-witted and very intelligent. What a beautiful mom! <br /> <br /> In fact, I did not like Loretta right away because she felt like she knew everything - who was not really as adventurous and as good at herself as she was she wanted others to think. She could talk to others about their lives and their mistakes, but she did not apply common sense to her own life. She was going to marry a middle-aged mom simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose in her life. She was more conventional than her own mother. She dressed and wore her supervisory hair in a house of detention. She seemed humorous and bored, but under you felt that she was vulnerable and lonely and that she had a lot of love to give to the good man. She would probably end up being a great mother too. <br /> <br /> I could see in the future, a house filled with screaming and happy children of Loretta and Ronnie and Rose and Cosmo enjoy it thoroughly.
