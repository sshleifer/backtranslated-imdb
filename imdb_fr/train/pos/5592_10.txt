Famous for introducing the world to Hedy Lamarr and complete frontal nudity, but it's so much more. In fact, it is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry, with some of the major works of art cinema of the 30s, in the same prestigious group as Under the Roofs of Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even Atalanta. It is almost a silence, resting mainly on his miraculous images, as well as on his fantastic symphonic score by Giuseppe Becce. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, but also editing, directing, writing and acting. 90% of the film is moving forward perfectly. Machat√Ω seems to be an expert in the use of motifs. It may not be as subtle as it may be, and maybe a bit overused, but the appearance of objects like insects, lights and horses beautifully bears the story. The small snatches of dialogue are fortunately not intrusive. They do not shine as much as one could imagine. The last element is strange to say the least. Reminiscent of Russian silences, we have a montage of workers. It does not make much sense in the course of storytelling, but it's so beautiful that I refuse to overemphasize this flaw. Ecstasy is a film that desperately needs to be rediscovered. It is one of the best films ever made.
