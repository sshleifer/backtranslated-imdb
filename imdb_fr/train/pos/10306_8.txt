Living near Buffalo, New York, this film scored points with me even before I saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some passages with television and television presenters in real life Buffalo ... and, for once, it does not hit the region. Alleluia! <br /> <br /> Regarding theology, puh-leeze !!! God is always made to look like and think like humans ... and, of course, to be a little on the liberal side. As a light comedy, nothing should deserve a prize, but it's entertaining and a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of hilarious comedy and, hopefully, intended for the public - from Christians to atheists - got something in addition to some laughs, such as what should be the prayer . Congratulations to the writers for at least that this theology is correct and that it spreads a good message. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a film with a good heart that should shock very little.
