I have always been a big fan of Cybill Shepperd since I saw his series a few years ago !! This film certainly shows it in its best light! The film was wonderfully performed and played !! From time to time, she drops funny little words, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen! Everyone is really out !! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the film a reality !! Also I loved the little tip where Mavis loses her wig and she almost dies when she falls to the ground !! It's the movie at its best !!
