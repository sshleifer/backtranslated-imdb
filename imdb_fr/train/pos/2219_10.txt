This film was a fascinating look at Creole culture and society that few African Americans know about. My two children are from a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the free-color people and a black-skinned woman whose parents were former slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was cut off from all his family except for one sister who pitied the plight of his brothers; raising 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; provide the family with food whenever they can. Of course, she helped clandestinely this family, fearing for her own communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We made it a part of our library.
