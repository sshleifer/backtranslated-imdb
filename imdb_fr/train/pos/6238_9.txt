Uncompromising Gaze on a 21st Century Suburb in Vienna mixing the stories of six character groups from the former documentary filmmaker U.Seidl is a provocative, minimalist and intense observation movie. <br /> <br /> After World Broadcasting Among Big Brother's reality shows, Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an alarming and profound level. A piece of European art-cinema that is difficult to love but insignificant may seem cruel and shabby, but nevertheless manages to convey the nihilistic and alienated feeling of modern society in a laudable way. <br /> <br /> A must for world cinema lovers.
