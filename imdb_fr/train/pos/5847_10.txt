Although this series lasted only one season, she stayed with me for 20 years. It was by far and above all my favorite designs. I would give almost anything to have it on DVD or whatever format I can get. If you find any way to see this series, I suggest you make the most of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) to present a truly coherent scenario spanning several episodes. It also made me really care about the characters and what happened to them. Heck the Goose character scared me sometimes. He was just so strange at the time. The band leader also reminds me a lot of the combination of Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / rights holder of the series and can put it on DVD, please do it absolutely !!!
