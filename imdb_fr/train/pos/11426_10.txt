I think this film would be more enjoyable if everyone considered it a picture of colonial Africa in the 50s and 60s rather than a story. Because there is no real story here. Just a thumbnail on another, like little dots of light that do not mean much until there is enough to paint. The first time I saw Chocolat, I did not really "understand" it before I thought about it for a few days. Then I realized that there were a lot of things to "get", including the end of colonialism that was only at a turning point, no conspiracy. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The scene at the airport with the brief shower and the beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "thrilling" movies, do not look at it - you'll be bored with tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
