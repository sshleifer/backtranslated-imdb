Laugh often loudly by playing funny on sex, family, and classes in Beverly Hills leave more laughter of the zip code than has been seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. The plot is centered on two drivers who bet on which one of them could sleep his employer (single or future single, very sexy - Bisset and Woronov) first. If Manuel wins, his friend will repay his debt to a violent Asian street gang. If he loses, he has to play with his friend! <br /> <br /> Many sizzling dialogues, a pretty sick physical humor, etc. But a lot of the comedy is just under the surface. Bartel is a very sensual and memorable family member who ends up taking his sexy, teenage niece on a one-year "missionary trip" to Africa. <br /> <br /> A hilarious pleasure.
