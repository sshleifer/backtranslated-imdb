it's a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when it came out. I just saw this movie recently and it reminds me again. Many of the films we watched when we were young do not seem to fit when we watch them later. The film is actually an excellent example of the 80's of the type of films made at the time. Keaton is at his best, all the actors have really done a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story move the film forward instead of forcing it. The pace of the film is fast with a few slow points and seeing the cars of the 80s is too much fun. Being 80s, I loved seeing the nasty stimulant again. The film is an excellent film for all comedy lovers and moviegoers of the 80s.
