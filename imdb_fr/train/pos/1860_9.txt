I went to see Antone Fisher not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's acting role was exceptional and the script was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual job, both actor and director. You realize that people with mental problems CAN be helped and this film is a perfect example. Do not miss this one.
