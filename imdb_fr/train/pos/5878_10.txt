Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as a womanizer who has business with 3 girls and is engaged at the same time. John Abraham is sometimes funny and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. Director Priyadarshan has presented some great films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are among the best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he made. The three new actresses are average. Rimi sen does not have much scope in this film. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple scenario of a guy having an affair with 3 girls at the same time. The 3 girls have a day off the same day and end up in the same house. Filled with tons of laughs, it's a nonstop animator.
