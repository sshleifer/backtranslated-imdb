I saw him as a child in the late '80s and I must say that Galaxy Express is one of those movies that stays long in your imagination. If you have never understood the attraction of the anime, discover this movie could be your ticket for the city of Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The animation of the cell, although somewhat traditional, has a lively style that explosively depicts the great talent of Leiji Matsumoto for the creation of characters and visual narration. <br /> <br /> This is one of those unique children's movies like Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and The Wizard of Oz that completely transcends the status of family entertainment and is considered a movie classic to its own conditions. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
