The 1986 TV movie The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series. However, the creator of Spirit, Will Eisner, did not like the film and no series was produced. I thought it was a very entertaining film and I captured the comical (sorry) spirit with a modern twist. I'm sorry, it did not materialize in a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect mind. Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and, of course, will later go to Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's big screen version of The Spirit, more people will be able to see this rare gem in Spirit's history. It seems that when Hollywood makes a movie with a character or idea already established, someone will inevitably look for previous versions of the property and will broadcast on video to earn a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas donned Zorro's mask, we were able to obtain earlier versions of the masked hero on DVD, such as the superb 1970's version of Alain Delon (although all the copies I saw were poorly edited) . Heres is hoping someone will soon release The Spirit's television adventure on DVD.
