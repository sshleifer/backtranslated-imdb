Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a frying pan. . . If the genre of the psycho-thriller movie or the horror movie does not bother you and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted movie, this is the movie for you. "Hatred of a Minute" is an astonishingly well-developed first film that catches the eyes of classics such as "Silence of the Lambs" and cult classics like "Army of Darkness". The editing and effects are well done, better than many movies of the genre. Kallio weaves a complex story of torment inspired by both the Bible and Poe's writings. At a time when big-budget films lack substance, the independent film resurrected this dying trait. If you like Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, check out "Hate the minute".
