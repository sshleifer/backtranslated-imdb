I did not see this movie, but I must. After reading Thor Heyerdahl's three books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The thesis that Peruvians emigrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Considering that this crew had NO GPS, and only an old valve radio (tube) with a 6-watt output, their trip was heroic to say the least. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can. tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
