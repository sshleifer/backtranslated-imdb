It's a film that was very well done. I had heard mixed reviews during his production and I was waiting for his release! Congratulations to the director and all the actors. The support cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to lead this to the top. As everyone says here, the last part of the film is fascinating. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character, since she did not do a lot of work during the making of this film. She has quite a career ahead of her. I was surprised by his performance. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, questioned my values ​​in life and my priorities, and I'm a better person for that! A big message lies in the movie. Release it so everyone can enjoy!
