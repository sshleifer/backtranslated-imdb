I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my greatest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain has not only exceeded the limits, it has defined a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To this day, my friends and I remain in the soundtrack of Purple Rain and claim to be Prince and Revolution. <br /> <br /> most of the time, this film itself is made by music. The game? Please, do not let me judge on this, because it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know it was not worthy of an Oscar. But I think the duo who took this movie was Morris and Jarome, their passwords talk was just beyond the joke. I just want to note this movie about the concert sequences because I got the impression that this is what made the film. <br /> <br /> Prince is a genius of music and has created a beautiful music. Although the film and the acting are rather bad, this film is always fun to watch at night and even to dance. This film defined the 80s, so have fun. Prince would like it to be like that, just to party! Oh, boy, it sounded lame. <br /> <br /> 9/10
