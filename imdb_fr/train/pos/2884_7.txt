Of all the Princess stories that Disney has told, Cinderella is probably the most appealing. I can not really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation, propels it to the top of the list. As a little girl, I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper - it was my absolute favorite costume. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not think there is a story that fulfills more the desires of the human heart than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to flee the chores of everyday life and find someone who sees you as nobody has ever been? The story is older than the English language and, one way or another, it always sounds true. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, Disney can be a bad guy. Lady Tremaine does harm to the T, in a wonderfully calculating, not overtly physical way. Her sharp tongue and her eyes do the work for her - she does not need a lightening stick to scare your heart. Animal friends tend to squeak, especially this idiot Gus. I would have applauded if he had met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself was not unfortunate - sometimes making just catty remarks. However, it just lacked the will to make it quite sympathetic. Of course, she was kind and fed the animals, but what kept her there? We never know. Even if she has only become a housekeeper in another house, at least she will be paid and will seek respect. It seems that the only reason things work in the end for Cindy is that everything falls in some way on his lap. She never works for her dreams that she sings so tenderly. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the music, which is always so beautiful. Ilene Woods has a charming and rich voice, probably my favorite of all Disney heroines. Some great standards have their origin here- A dream is a dream that your heart makes, so it's love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful story from the heart with a ton of musical moments. Although it lacks a bit of character development, it provides classy villains and excellent vocal work. If you feel sick, make it burst, it will warm you up and make you shudder Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> -Surprise! Surprise! -Duh duh duh- Happy birthday!
