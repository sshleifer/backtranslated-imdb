I watch most of Nick Mancuso's movies because, frankly, I like him, even though he's older in time, he's generally considered mean (long-time fans should note that he's for a reason or another blonde in this movie). It's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot (but most movies nowadays are not really original), but Rick Roberts is attractive, because his imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is as much as his daughter, and Mitzi Kapture does a good job, if that was his goal, be angry and sometimes quite hard to love. Nick has always understood that he is able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot takes place off screen - like motivation, past behavior, good and bad times - and elements that seem obvious to the characters never reach the audience (ie me). The final scene leaves something to be desired in the category "but what about ...", and overall, I can not say I cared a lot about one of the characters. That being said, that was what it was - a pretty fun way to spend the afternoon - and I still love Nick.
