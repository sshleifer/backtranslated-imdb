Big S does not play with taboos or force an agenda like, for example, Mencia or Chapel (although I love them both). It states the obvious in subtle, almost subliminal remarks. His show will not change the world, he is not supposed to do it. But, with the hilarious Brian Posehn and ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of Paget Brewster's "Mr. Show", this is a nasty show with an appetite for destruction! My side was completely destroyed by the first episode. Listen, I love this woman and, like her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just gives the lines and lets the viewer run with it. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and anyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode when she sings for fake birds on striking comments about society and existential university nonsense. This one is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and have not lost it in their last lippo-sucking or breast working treatment).
