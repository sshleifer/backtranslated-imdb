Since I first watched it, "Piedras" is one of my favorites and one of the few pictures I could watch over and over again. The big story describes the life of a group of women (all interconnected in one way or another) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar made a convincing film in his directorial debut and is an effective actor director. <br /> <br /> But it's not that all performances are excellent. Of all the great leaders, they go from the average (Najwa Nimri) to the very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation should be addressed to the newcomer Mónica Cervera, who convincingly interprets the girl Antonia delayed San Juan. Enrique Alcides has an irresistible charm as a nurse of the girl. Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar, also have some lovely filming. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is beautifully written and filmed I looked so upset that I could not help but think about it for days. I highly recommend it.
