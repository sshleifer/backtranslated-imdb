I saw the German version of the film on German television and was really amazed. I usually like to see documentaries, but I do not remember seeing one that is better than "Earth". I knew some scenes of Youtube videos found by random navigation. I also remember seeing parts of the film in multimedia stores, on HDTVs. After watching the movie, I understand very well why this movie is so popular among Youtube users and heads of multimedia outlets: it is so impressive and spectacular that you can not help but watch on the screen, it does not matter if you are generally interested in nature. documentaries or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitation, a 10 out of 10. Certainly, there are more and more thrilling films, but as far as documentaries are concerned, "Earth" is without a doubt one of the best his genre.
