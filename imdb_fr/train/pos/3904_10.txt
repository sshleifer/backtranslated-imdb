In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I have ever seen. I became an instant fan of Eddie after seeing Dress to Kill, but I must say that I think it's his best job. I would say though, if you ever have the chance to definitely see him live. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after attending a stand-up routine many times, the jokes begin to age. But I have to say, I've seen this series so many times that I literally memorized everything (which, yes, I realize it's a little sad), but every joke always makes me laugh. It's really a show that feels good. <br /> <br /> Dress to kill will never grow old for me. I own it and look at it every time I need to laugh.
