If the Australian Post needs a promotional film for recruiting, that's the answer. It's one of those movies whose heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again. Miranda's performance is touching as it shows an aspect of Australia that has not been imagined by many Europeans. Indeed, it can be cold, wet and dreary, as everywhere else and everywhere else, the important thing is the people around you. The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career a real "desk of dead letters". Miranda has gone on to make bigger films, but I hope she still keeps a thought inside for this one?
