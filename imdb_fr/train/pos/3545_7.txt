Great splashy movie of Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to roll the dice and organize illegal shit games. The blonde in love with Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he gives up craps. He decides on a final match when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Who Bets Big, is in town. He bets to Sky that he can not get that Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), in charge of mission, accompanies it to Havana. This may seem like a summary of the strange plot, but the film is too! <br /> <br /> It's a real mix - there are some wonderful things here. The songs are all good and the dance is amazing. The real show is the shit game at the end. Also, Brando is really good here - it may seem strange to think of him singing and dancing, but he succeeds. I have to admit that seeing Brando, big and bulky, performing difficult dance moves was a lot of fun! Plus, Sinatra is very good and Blaine is just beautiful as a girlfriend who has been suffering for a long time. Her song and dance numbers are highlights here. <br /> <br /> Turning now to the negatives: Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she has a dull and colorless role and can not do much. The film is way too long at 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons are really hanging out and should have been shortened. In addition, most characters speak very precise English - contractions are never used. Maybe it's trying to be fun coming out of the mouths of gangsters, but I thought it was shocking and it threw me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth catching for songs and dances but its excessive length comes after a while. I give him a 7.
