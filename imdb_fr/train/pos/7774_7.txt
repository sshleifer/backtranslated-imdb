"Written on the Wind" was an extremely successful universal image. This could only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities offered by the documents he was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation of George Zuckerman, it contains all the elements necessary for an excellent melodrama: nymphomania, large oil wealth, alcoholism, incest and slight touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk paved the way for what would later follow in the genre of soap operas, mainly "Dallas" and "Dynasty", just to mention two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this film was shot entirely inside a studio. Most of the decor is wrong. Like many of these 1950s images, "Written on the Wind" was shot entirely in the studio. Just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in Manhattan, Miami or even at the lake, we can see how the landscape is a painted backdrop. Mr. Sirk did not care about realism as he could tell the story in his own way. <br /> <br /> We recently attended a screening, part of a resumption of Mr. Sirk's work, where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during scenes where Rock Hudson, who plays the good Mitch Wayne, appears. There is also something graphic in the way Robert Keith, who plays Patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later his own daughter, the wicked Marylee, caress the oil derrick that adorns the old man's desk, a kind of phallic object of art. <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wanted his cast to give the best performances, which is logical in the way Dorothy Malone describes the nymphomaniac Marylee and, to a certain extent, Robert Stack, who plays the role of Kyle , the tormented heir of the story. This would probably be the easy explanation of what appears on the screen. The only one that seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who was not asked to make Lucy Moore believe that her character was anything other than a person ingrained surprised to hang out with the bad crowd. <br /> <br /> Together with his other Hollywood "Written on the Wind" shows the genius of a talented director who gave the audience what he wanted to see: stories bigger than life that one could only see on the big screen
