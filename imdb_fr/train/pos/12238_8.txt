I have always loved this comedy as one of the few to seriously strive to meet the US government's annual tax demand. Have you ever read a tax code ?: it is quite trying to respect its many clauses invoked by our congressmen and senators to help their funders and various interest groups. Despite claims that it is right, the tax code has always placed the lion's share of the burden on the middle class and the working class rather than the rich and influential. Most of the various special clauses are intended for their use - they follow the 1040 or 1040A average form and look at the variety of different investment and business firms that all have a different set of rules. <br /> <br /> The story told here is that a wealthy landowner (Philip Ober) uses his influence to inform the IRS of his neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle). taxes paid in 20 years. The IRS office in Baltimore is headed by Fred Clarke and he draws Ober's attention with his influence. He sends Tony Randall to check the situation. <br /> <br /> Randall finds that Douglas, Merkle, their three daughters and two boys are rather honest people, who rarely need money (they get along on their farm products and barter with their neighbors) . But Randall, formed with clear lines (tax code) of the tax code, tries to define the family fundamentals. But little by little, Douglas finds that Reynolds adores Randall and continues to distract Randall from his task, eventually putting him intoxicated. It also makes it difficult for Randall to leave by having the engine removed from his car "for repair" by his two sons. <br /> <br /> The intrigue stems from the growing attraction and friction between Randall, an ambitious and vague urban, and the countryside, Reynolds love life. They make a nice couple actually. Finally, after Ober complains, Randall is thrown out of favor and Clarke (a harder cookie) is in trouble. And comes with a very big tax bill, which might ruin Douglas's family. <br /> <br /> The film does not stop there - it ends well, but it reminds us that the power to tax is the power to destroy, and that the government goes too often for destruction. A chance at a million setbacks saves the family, but it's so rare that we know it's just a dramatic turn. Clarke's director (Charles Lane) is more realistic about Ober's "help" by suggesting that his taxes be scrutinized more closely next year. After that, Ober is rather green.
