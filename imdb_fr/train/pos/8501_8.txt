I think it's a good example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a good movie to show in a sociology class. I thought it was pretty funny and I must say that I am a fanatic of this conspiracy device "allows to unite and do the job". It seems that most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. It also contains some dramatic elements and I think they harmonize well. Overall, I give him a solid 8.
