My Take: A fun interpretation of THE LION KING, which acts as a continuation. Amazingly fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "The Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another fun video clip that deserves theatrical treatment. I do not see why Disney released this film directly on video and released shitty movies like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland" in a theatrical way. These films are best seen in video libraries (in the "novelties" area), rather than having their theatrical posters outside the galleries. <br /> <br /> This is simply a parody of the first movie (although the events of "Simba's Pride" have not yet taken place), from Timon's point of view (voiced by Nathan Lane) and of Pumbaa (expressed by Ernie Sabella). We see them mocking the events of the first film. The original voices of the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, take over their roles from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller offer hilarious comic relief as Timon's mother and her puffy uncle. /> <br /> Does not that sound funny to you? Maybe not now, but look at it yourself. The fact that it is not so serious in its plot makes it even more enjoyable. It's a bit like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
