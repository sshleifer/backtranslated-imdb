Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of slaps, stab wounds and shots (but do not worry, the first goal is a terrible blow), it can be described as a violent frenzy across Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays the role of Pang, a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a lawyer. Although dirty on his journey, he is almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of a visibly expensive restaurant. If this sounds extremely unlikely, you should probably avoid this movie. It allowed me to suspend disbelief and I had a lot more fun for her. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang is Wai (Sam Lee), an edgy young policeman who likes to hit people almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai is on a good line and the internal affairs are investigating him. His father, the legendary Good Cop, is in a coma as a result of a drug-related transaction that has turned south (the implication is that Wai let his father go after him for his own corrupt deals. ). <br /> <br /> There are car accidents here, many murders and a strange and clumsy love affair, all in an almost comical style. I suspect that the humor was deliberate (no one uses gargantuan concrete batons without an eye for extravagant absurdity), though the delirious nature has lost a number of my fellow members of the public. The film could have ended at least three times and after 109 minutes, it might have benefited from a more ruthless editing, or the removal of one of the son of the narrative interactions with the three fathers ). <br /> <br /> I am inclined to give it a pass (high), however, if only by the end ?? I have rarely heard so many people laugh so loud about what should have been a poignant moment. To do with a group of friends who like ridicule
