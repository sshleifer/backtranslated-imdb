The Plainsman is an entertaining western, probably a classic, which is still relevant today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, ideal for the role. With John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors who played the Western heroes of their generation. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, no one I know has played better than her. Although it may not always be historically accurate, the film manages to capture what is most important about Hickok and his time. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point, and that's what DeMille does here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to the Indians by a major manufacturer to make up for the losses he would have suffered as a result of the end of the Civil War, Custer and Little Big Horn, the difficult relationship between the woman Buffalo Bill, a religious woman, with Hickok, a man who had killed many people, and the unusual love relationship between Hickok and Calamity, all make "The Plainsman" an interesting and unconventional film. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, which shows already how much he would become a great actor. Much care has been taken to show the original weapons of this era.
