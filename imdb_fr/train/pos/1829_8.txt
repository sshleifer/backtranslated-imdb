What a fun St. Ives movie is. This reminds me of the type of film made in the 40s. Classical history, complemented by characters and a plot neither dramatic nor too complicated. In fact, nothing is finished. The story of Robert Lewis Stevenson - here adapted to the screen - reads like Jane Austen for men. We have a tale that has a love story in the heart, but there's a lot of fun too: battle scenes (sort of), prison breakouts, mistaken identities, swordplay, and the most funny that I've heard for years: "Only Scotland is invited to announce his name at a masquerade ball." There is a lot of hilarity, difficulties and not a little grief while St. Ives tries to fight and find the path of the family and the life he barely knew. <br /> <br /> The cast is absolutely stellar, with too few often seen Jean Marc Barr absolutely perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing delicacy while the resources Flora and Miranda Richardson, very ingenious, go away almost with the film as his wise and mundane, having been there and having seen everything, his Aunt Susan. Richard Grant provides first-rate comedic relief. <br /> <br /> This film will not be the best film ever, but its charms are undeniable and the film as a whole contains an energy brimming with life. .
