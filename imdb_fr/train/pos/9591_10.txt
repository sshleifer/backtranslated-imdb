An excellent documentary. I personally remember growing up in New York in the early 80's. This movie is for everyone who was not present at the time. This shows the only thing that the Afroamerican Gay Underclass thought was theirs, the love and camadry that you see are real. People are real and, unfortunately, few of them are still alive at the time of writing. Bullets are still held but not to the extent that they were in the eighties. This time is gone forever. It's a good movie pre homo thug. When the queen was really proud to be extroverted. Goodbye to Storyville, it's another time gone by but very documented in all hail movies!
