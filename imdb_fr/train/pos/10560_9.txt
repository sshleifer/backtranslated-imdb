Jimmy Cagney is constantly before your eyes in this story of a theater producer who is vigorously fighting against upcoming "talking" movies. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women and dance is presented so that as a spectator, you are never treated at a moment of boredom. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was extremely well done. The story has never really been lost in this fast pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here are a little out of date, but that does not matter, because when you look at it in 1933, it's fabulous to see it next to the others films that have been released during this period. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film, never losing her composure as always. active producer of previews made for movie theaters in the form of intro. In this way, he tries to save his ass from bankruptcy, he was a broadway producer before starting. Joan Blondell is fabulous as a Nan, in love with neglected interest, she gives such an unusual performance for movies of this era, so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the huge productions in the end. These were beautiful in themselves, beautifully choreographed and wonderfully done, but they simply did not seem to fit the story. The only connection they have with the main story is that Cagney had to do 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been saying throughout the movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater. In this way, the "session on the fence of the court" was much more appropriate for the story. <br /> <br /> The productions at the end seemed to end this fast-paced story and it was not a good thing. I was tired after watching the first musical sequence, then realized there were two more to come. These sequences also made the audience laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a great film with a sour end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
