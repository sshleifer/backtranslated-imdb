Brad Silberling, scriptwriter / director, did 10 projects or less in two weeks with a very limited budget. This film was shot in Carson, California, and gives the impression that the whole story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word. Silberling was fortunate enough to associate veteran actor Morgan Freeman, among his big projects, to the Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people of different benefits who manage to improve the life of the other. . <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - though, part of the comedy is that he's been portrayed as a jobless actor for four years, looking for a place for a little "filler film" in order to back in the flow of things. His "role" is to be a market manager and he is dropped off at the Carson Shabby Market where he meets, among other things, a Scarlet, the daughter of the controversial 10 Items or Less payline. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static work, but she is also generally angry with her philanthropic husband (Bobby Cannavale), who currently sleeps with Scarlet's lazy colleague (Anne Dudek), and her inability to get decent work elsewhere. The two partners, after some common problems, leave for a "journey on the road" that leads each character to develop from the presence and the life story of the other. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, Simply put, but because of the tender connection between Freeman and Paz it works very well. It's one of those little human relations films where the message is to be vulnerable to change and exchange. It is definitely worth watching. It's a touching, informative and funny DVD - a pleasure to watch. Grady Harp
