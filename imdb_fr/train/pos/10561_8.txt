089: Footlight Parade (1933) - released on 30/09/1933, seen on 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The ice cream cone is invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we played another Warner Bros musical in Busby Berkeley. This time, it's the ultra-fast walk Footlight Parade, starring James Cagney in the role of theater producer, Chester Kent. I am 100% sure that Cagney will channel Berkeley with his interpretation of the irrepressible Kent, which must propose new ideas of representation by the minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as a tart secretary who has become enamored. The sub-plot Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell is not as important but this time no less pleasant. One thing that puzzled me was the Berkeley performances themselves, which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be played on any scene, let alone a scene that would show a movie later. Obviously, Busby does not let a thing like history stop him from collecting the most exaggerated musical numbers he can imagine. I almost loved the whole film until the end, with the outrageously offensive number "Shanghai Lil", which, as one can guess, is about as disconcerting as unpleasant racist performances. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six films in three months. It must be a new record. Anyway, this complements Warner Bros. musical trilogy of 1933, preceded by "42nd Street" and "Gold Diggers of 1933". I would definitely recommend looking at the three as a result. I wonder if James Cagney was channeling Busby Berkeley while playing Chester Kent in this film, or if the role of the script was inspired by Busby. I hope it was logical that Berkeley was the kind of guy who would see dances developed in everyday events like Chester does. The funny thing about Cagney is that he did not really look like an important man in the traditional sense of the word. He had a square head and spoke with a strange New York accent. But the guy was rather versatile, ranging from venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the very talkative types of producers we see here. And he could dance. He was essentially a prominent man in the body of an actor. The rest of the cast has familiar faces: Joan Blondell returns and steals the show as a coveted and coveted secretary of Cagney; Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play Billy Barty reappears under the nickname malicious. The film is typical of the more racy and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-code era, as opposed to the more family-oriented 50's and 60's, and is an excellent culmination of Warner's musicals. the same year (the number "Shanghai Lil" not held, Keeler doing a mediocre job watching Chinese). <br /> <br /> Last film: Dinner At Eight (1933), upcoming film: I'm I'm No Angel (1933).
