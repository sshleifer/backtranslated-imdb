I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise are an excellent pair. This film is really funny and I love songs. My favorite songs are "You can not keep a good dog" and this song on sharing, I think it's called "What's mine is yours". It was the last film with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie but I think Itchy's voice is so fun to hear. Although some scenes I found scary, I still have trouble watching the scene of Charlie's dream and Carface scares me. I found other characters like King Gator really very funny. The end was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.
