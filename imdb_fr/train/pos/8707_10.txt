"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I have ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English by "the sword-bearer". The main hero (Sasha) was born with exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword that emerges from under the skin of his hand. At the first camp, he may seem like another superhero in this senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. It's hard to call him even anti-hero. I think he's just a person who has lost the meaning of his life and his faith in good, justice and love. In his life, he has never met anyone who can understand and love him (with the exception of his mother). Every step is stained with blood; he is taking revenge on everyone for his gift, which has become a damnation to him. And suddenly he meets her. It does not need unnecessary discussion or explanation. She loves him for who he is. She does not care what he did. The fact that he is next to her is more important than anything else. But soon, she discovers his secret: he kills two people (his ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her under his eyes. Even after that, she could not escape her feelings. They try to run but it's hard to hide. Finally, they have a serious car accident. He is in a cage; she is in a psychiatric hospital. They do not know anything about each other, but she thinks he's going to save her. He overcomes many obstacles but finally finds it. They are still running but they are not invulnerable. She is injured, she needs rest, but the police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, they go into a corner, then his sword begins to cut down trees surrounded by helicopters, but she does not need it because she's already dead in her arms and he's the person lonely worldwide again.
