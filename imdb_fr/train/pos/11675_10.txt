I'm still Dakar, so when my husband bought the Charlie 'Race to Dakar' DVD at his place, I could not wait to watch it! Of course, we saw the broadcast of the race when the race started, but it never gives the background and the specific teams. <br /> <br /> If you look at Long Way Round, you will not be surprised by the language that I find frankly more fun than offensive. <br /> <br /> I think the only thing that bored me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he had combed it before Dakar, so that my feminine need for cleanliness was appeased; Although I could have lived without the "flame" underwear lol As with LWR, the preparation was just as interesting as the race itself. I almost cried when Charlie broke his hand and grimaced at every bruise he suffered during his training ... and of course the death of Andy Caldicott ... it was a dreadful tragedy, but every year there is something. <br /> <br /> Russ makes me crazy, although his attitude has improved a thousand times over the cynical argument he held in LWR. It's great to see him get along so well with Charlie now. <br /> <br /> What I learned from this odyssey was - 1. Never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for NOTHING! - They had months to prepare the X5 and, the day before the team's departure for Lisbon, Scorpion had done only half the tasks to be done and the vehicle was painful throughout the race. 2. The Dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider / driver recovery plan - leaving Matt (and presumably a lot of other riders / drivers ready to dry out as they did was nothing less than culpable negligence 3. Charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for 'hard and hard' adventure but needs a lot of rigidity to really perform as he would like and, finally, 4. Charlie and Ewan anticipate another of these epics called the Long Way Down in 2007, and I can not wait to get my hands on it !: D If you like motorbikes and / or really nice guys, you have to watch it, I guarantee you that you like it It's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, for Simon Pavey - you are a hero, I was so impressed by how you are 'able to succeed' and by the fact that you have finished ..... just amazing considering the difficulty histo and Charlie, Matt and the rest of the team - congratulations on being successful. To think that a relatively green team could have accomplished so much is truly admirable. You are all wonderful.
