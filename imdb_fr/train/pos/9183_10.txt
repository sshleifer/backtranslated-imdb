This wonderful BBC TV production in 1983 (and not a movie as others have written here) of the famous love story "Jane Eyre", starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke in As long as Jane, is the most refined version that has been made to date. since he is the most faithful to Charlotte Bronte's novel both in his concept and in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; when film producers begin to mix with the forces of a classic, it is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of THIS "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and fidelity to the original, resulting in a spectacularly addictive composition that is worth seeing several times to appreciate the multiple levels of sweetness, pleasure and suspense. The performances are delicious, the music is perfect, even the gothic design of the house and the outdoor shots are beautiful and set the right tone for the production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, though slight, is that this version, like all versions ever made of Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not hesitate to stay with Rochester after discovering that he had a crazy wife and that he was still married to her. "Oh, just divorced," she said to her man, or she would live in sin with him. But Jane Eyre knew she could not accept this course of life and respect herself. Why? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had taught since her childhood, not the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution, but the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who had been martyred rather than do not play the other. One day, I would like to see a version describe these influences a little more deeply in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing: "But come, Lord Jesus!" should not have the fundamentals of this faith stripped down.
