Now, either you like Mr. Carrey's humor, or you do not like it. Irene, myself and myself had spectators coming out en masse and, on the other hand, encouraging and collapsing in puddles of joy. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> If you are not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and I still laughed the same gags when I saw the movie. If you can not find a funny dog ​​folding the seat after using the toilet, do not bother with the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a journalist stuck in a rut covering "lighter information" reprimands God when his whole life seems to go in isolation. God takes the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey embarks on the game to have all the powers of God by enlarging the breasts of her girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), getting promoted, and answering everyone's prayers with computer commands at once. <br /> This is not a highbrow or even memorable film, but it is very well done in its very limited intent, provides almost continual laughter to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be harmless to all except the closest minds-divine and anti-god-squadders. <br /> <br /> On a more thoughtful plan, the film tries to speculate on Carrey's own career - stuck in his cast of "comedy", he has largely left no impression of actor seriously, even after winning two Golden Globes. His most accomplished "heterosexual" role, The Man on the Moon, is less known than his comedy - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy has accumulated three nominations while skirting Carrey).
