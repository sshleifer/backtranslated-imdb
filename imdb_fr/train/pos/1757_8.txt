The key to 40-year-old The Virgin is not just the fact that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but in the way Steve Carell portrays him as such. In a kind of vulgar "comedy" that has become characteristic of her lack of humor and endearing characters, The Virgin, 40, offers a colorful cast and an intelligent and sincere plot that does not use her protagonist as a point final. cruel jokes. The fact that Andy is still a virgin at forty is not a joke, but rather a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carell, a veteran of the Ferrell in Anchorman team and a former Daily Show cast member, uses the concept of the film to expand his character ?? we understand why Andy is as he is. It's the little things that make this movie work. When Andy's colleague at an electronics store asks what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his unsuccessful cooking efforts. When Andy goes to work by bike, he signals to him to turn. He does not only decorate his house with figurines he paints them and speaks to them, and reveals that some of the oldest belong to him since his childhood. A less comedy would not even begin to focus on all these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simplistic ?? Andy's workmates discover that he has never had sex and they make a personal quest to put him to bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the film does not hide its youth. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) broke up with his girlfriend two years ago. Always obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a woman's man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their attempts to put Andy in the bag turn against many times, leaving Andy increasingly less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets Trish, a single mother (played by Catherine Keener), and much to the chagrin of her disturbing friends who claim mothers are not worth it, he falls in love with her . They start a relationship and agree to postpone having sex for twenty days ?? Trish unaware that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin was led by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and started the short cult TV show Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is renowned for its unique sense of humor and storyline ?? co-written by Carell ?? offers a lot. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, the most interesting and even the most surprising aspect of the Virgin of 40 years is its maturity. Now, you probably know that the film has received rave reviews from critics, and I was even surprised by its warm welcome. But after seeing the movie, it's easy to understand why. We love Andy. We care about him. It's not just a clich√© of cardboard-comedy cut out of cardboard? it is a real person, alive and breathable. His neurotic features combine the best of Woody Allen with a childlike naivety. His friends are not fools and his love is tumultuous and bittersweet. This strikes the audience. <br /> <br /> Although this film is far from perfect and contains rather crude insinuations and sexual humor, it does not offend as much as other genre entries would have because that we have affection for the people on the screen. The best sexual comedies work this way ?? from Risky Business to American Pie ?? and that's the big difference between something like The Virgin 40 years and 40 days and 40 nights.
