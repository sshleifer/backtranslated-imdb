This film is one of several "Kung Fu" action films made in Asia in the late '70s and early' 80s, bursting with cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue and ultra-martial action. fast. But unlike most movies of this genre, it also has a decent plot and a lot of good comedy. When dye factory workers are forced out of their jobs by Manchu bullies, they hire a scammer (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them away. When his attempt fails miserably, he stands against his path in a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for real. But instead of making him a student of Kung-Fu, the Master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 rooms. Well, it turns out that while he's performing these basic tasks (stacking and attaching bamboo poles), he's getting the skills to become an expert in Kung Fu! It's a bit like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel's karate basics by asking him to do the usual household chores - "wax, wax," and so on. There is a lot of good comedy from start to finish and a lot of action in the end when Gordon Liu again faces his Manchu executioners. "This time, it's not just tricks - it's the real thing!" Liu said, beating his chest proudly. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, do not miss this one!
