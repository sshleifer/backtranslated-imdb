It's hard to watch this movie without thinking about the TV show, especially if, like me, you enjoy the TV show more. But there is a lot to say about the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is one of New York's best sports writers. He lives alone in an apartment of eight rooms, victim of divorce and his own. stubbornly sloppy state of mind. Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik state of mind. The result is a wrecked train and one of the most popular movie adaptations of a Neil Simon play. <br /> <br /> The first thing to do: I love this apartment! A poker table, a dart board, photos of baseball players, empty bottles of alcohol and beer and even a pair of Roman columns. It's a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening the stage of the Oscar play, transferring the action into the bedrooms and the kitchen and giving more tension to the growing tension between Oscar and Felix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Neal Hefti's familiar score was heard on the TV show, but it has never been so orchestrated in the way it is presented here, in different settings that make the action on the screen skyrocket each time it is played. Real filming and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot there and at that time ("Buddwing", "The world of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy", "Candidate Manchurian", "Rosemary's Baby", etc.) <br /> <br /> Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair, the film is supposed to be a more serious affair, dealing with the then-unusual condition of mid-life divorce and the frustration inherent in the inability to make a relationship work. Simon has more in mind than to enter Felix and Oscar in a "password" game or a witty battle with Howard Cosell. But I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau were both great actors I like to watch, especially in the middle of this movie, as I often do in their separate movies, but I never understood why. considered a great comedy team. Here, in their best partnership, they seem to be playing in two different films; Lemmon in a dramatic comedy and Matthau in a farce. Matthau is awesome at first, he seduces us with his teddy bear behavior around the poker table, but towards the end of the movie, he plays a role similar to that of Jack Torrance in "The Shining", reacting to the fact that Felix cleaned his apartment and served it. tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame. <br /> <br /> While the end bothers me, the part that many consider the most shocking, the beginning, works very well as I see it. Watching Felix stumble while trying to commit suicide is not a big comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, inflicting real pain before you bring warmth and laughter. (In addition, it contains beautiful images of the sunniest parts of the city.) In the middle of the film, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way to establish Felix's torment and create a Deep relief coming when we see Oscar and his poker friends bickering and quarreling. <br /> <br /> This is where Simon's lines are great. They are the underlying strength of the film. He gets the exact and real joke, and always makes it fun. "Do not worry, Felix, you have something to say, what scares me is that I start listening." The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume that the film is always better. In fact, the TV show has already made a good argument about "presumption", but the film is a solid foundation and joy in its own right. .
