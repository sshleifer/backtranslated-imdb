I remember watching this movie Saturday afternoon on television in the 50s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope broadcast by transmitters secreted by lampaves when of one of the last maniacal executions for imminent release. I'm not sure that's consistent with the facts. <br /> <br /> Yet the film is well done. The German high command reports with irony and without emotion "The Russians advance in The Fredrich Strasse", as if everything was going as planned. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that this movie and another American had been designed for television off was inspired by the story of the British historian Trevor-Roper entitled Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised to see no credit to Trevor-Roper. <br /> <br /> I agree that the latest German film on the subject, DOWNFALL, was as well done as the classic. The American clash was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> Few personalities have attracted as much attention from film as Adolph. Still, I find it interesting that none of the many films and books published speaks of Hitler's double mentioned in passing in the magnificent historical piece of John Toland. <br /> <br /> Was it a joke?
