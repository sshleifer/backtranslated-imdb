Having heard of Modesty Blaise before, but having never read a novel or comic book, my wife and I enjoyed the movie. He provided, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and its context. <br /> <br /> Although it includes some elements of action film, it is much more of an intimate piece, excellently written. Unfortunately, this is also where a major disadvantage of the film is revealed. An intimate piece lives on the abilities of its actors and, unfortunately, only half of the cast is delivered. While Alexandra Staden did a great job as Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - like the wicked Miklos - did not do it. Smiling through the plot as if it were an advertisement for a toothpaste, he fails to create an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the film a masterpiece. The support troop is somehow similar, ranging from stereotypical gangsters and sluts to the decent performances of Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
