I loved the movie, but as everyone says, there were songs that were not developed enough. I personally thought that the girls were very tasteless before coming to jail; Of course, they were supposed to be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt they lacked that link that best friends are supposed to have. For example, in the montage where they tour, the way they stood for the photo was very clumsy. <br /> <br /> Then, some parts were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty well understood that Danes did not do it, but I can see how confusing that might be. Also, why did the camera linger on Manat with a very dark expression after placing the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it suggested something, but it turned out that it's nothing. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the film was excellent. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she is a GREAT actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I wanted to see this Thai girl bitch getting her ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure ...
