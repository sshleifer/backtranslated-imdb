Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are a perfect middle class couple wanting to build the house of their dreams. It all starts with reasonable projects and expectations, both of which are negated by innumerable complications and an explosion of the initial budget. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good laughs (even if the story is a little thin) Make sure to entertain the fans of the stars or the Hollywood comedy style of the late 1940s. The most notable is when a contractor experiences a reduction in all expenses, which must be excessive for a public in 1948. At the time of departure, he assures the client (Grant) that he may be able to make a reduction of 100 , 00 $ of the total ... or at least 50,00 $ ... but certainly of 25,00 $. Hilarious!
