In terms of visual beauty, this film is exceptional! I did not know Technicolor was out so soon. Although I do not like the end, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me wish to be in North Africa. The distribution is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a considerable advantage. Of course, she is so seductive and I loved her in this movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I could not go over the scenery and decor ... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, everything is there ... the legionnaires also bring a sense of "beautiful gesture" to the film. They certainly do not make movies like that anymore. Do not miss to watch this classic!
