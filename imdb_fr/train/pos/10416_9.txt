Like the Arabian Nights, this film plays with the conventions of narrative to make us feel that there is plot, plot and more: it opens on what seems to be the frame device of a blind man who tells the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback that takes us to the gift of the blind, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (It must be admitted that the second half does not quite keep the promise of the first.) Like the Arabian Nights, she tries to gather as many folk motifs from the Middle East as possible in the same work. A liberated genius, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea trips, a crowded market, an evil vizier, jewels ... I do not know why it works, but it works. Everything is so beautiful. The decorations are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rozsa's score is particularly beautiful. As usual, it sounds Hungarian; but one way or another, he manages to convince us that he is Hungarian in a Persian way.
