I really have to say that it was always my favorite when I went to see my grandmother. And it always is. It's very, very close to the book. The way it is filmed, and the players were all excellent! I must recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but it was really great! I gave him 10/10.
