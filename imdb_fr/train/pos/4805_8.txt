When I heard about this film for the first time, I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew it would not be a movie solid. Almost everything in this movie is awesome, the costumes are really amazing and the sets are also beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really let me down is the performance. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film. She brings Victoria to life. With this film, she shows that she is a great actress and that she may choose a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost as bland as Prince Albert, but he has excellent chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne, although I was expecting more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have a supportive role but are forgettable. <br /> <br /> For me, the film seems unfinished. Maybe the writers have changed too many things in the script, I do not know, but that's how I feel about the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall, it's a fantastic film about the early years of Victoria, with a great performance. from Emily Blunt.
