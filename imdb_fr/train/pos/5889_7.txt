Well, I must admit that I have never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I do not know anything about this comic talent duo, I've always loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose is trying her luck as a comedian. Rhoda fights with a career as a photographer. And Meredith ... what is she doing exactly? These three stories that we follow more than two hours are fun and fun in their own way. When the two longtime friends get together, it just makes the film better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the quality of writing. The jokes of Mary and Rhoda were funny. The scenario itself was very well prepared. <br /> <br /> In recent years, I had seen Moore and Harper in other films and I thought they were very good. But I did not know they worked as well as a team. While the two actresses do their part to fill the title of this film, they never seem to let me down. (During the filming of this film.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles well but nothing good. The rest of the cast, like Jonah, CÃ©cile and .... everyone works well together too. <br /> <br /> Since this is a meeting, you expect fans of both series to benefit. As a non-fan, I have always enjoyed this little meeting. Good story lines for each character and the two main characters make this movie a very good movie. (The new version of the MTM theme song does not hurt either.)
