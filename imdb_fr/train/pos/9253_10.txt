Well, the movie is not really "funny". <br /> <br /> OK, I admit that there are some lines HUMOROUS, but nothing really funny. For example: just before a hot sex scene between Eleniak and one of his male companions, sh is handcuffed to the bedstead and he can not take off his shirt. Before leaving the room to get the key, he says, "Okay, do not go anywhere." See, humorous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She is hot and sexy and there is a very hot scene with her that we can not help but rewind and watch again. <br /> <br /> There are also other sexy scenes with her and she has very provocative lines. <br /> <br /> Overall, 5 stars. I would only give three if not for Erika Eleniak.
