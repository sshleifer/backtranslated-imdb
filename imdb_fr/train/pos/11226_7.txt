Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First of all, it's a fan-only series, only available on the Web, which mainly includes friends and neighbors who own computer programs, video cameras and home sewing machines to be able to said Mickey & Judy, present a show. It's certainly friends and neighbors, you can tell. Many of these people are not the most beautiful people you have ever seen, neither the youngest nor the slimmest ?? some of them stumble in their lines as if they walked on marbles? some of them have thick accents, or just do not seem to speak well in the first place, making it almost impossible to understand a solitary word they say. However, it is clear that everything that these friends and neighbors have put in place is fun to watch. Yes, part of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it's a bit odd (though certainly a bit too cool) to watch two Starfleet males kiss each other (though some kisses seem to be prolonged.) Yes, you get a little cranky when they quote Clearly ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the Galaxy Quest theme at the beginning and end of each show. Okay. We can get by. Why? The graphics are first rate. Better than almost anything you saw. And sometimes, a show or two really stands out from the point of view of history? Some of them are actually very teary. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word. but credit must be given to those involved where credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to produce a production of this magnitude. People, sets, costumes, graphics ?? it is a huge effort on the part of many people. We look, we come back and we thank them.
