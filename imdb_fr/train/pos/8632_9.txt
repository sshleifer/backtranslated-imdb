It's a moral comedy. So sometimes there is a slight hint of bitterness, but a lightness sweetens all sarcasm and irony until suddenly a moment stops your heart and changes everything. This film, beautifully written and directed, is a jewel that shines to perfection, with a beautiful interpretation by all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite, as usual, and Romy Schneider is a perfect and bright pearl not to be missed. A really wonderful movie !!
