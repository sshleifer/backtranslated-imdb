For those who think that humor and immaturity are strictly potassiers, it is actually the insane spirit. Although the series contains a lot of jokes about the pot, it also contains a lot of satirical material and makes fun of social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. All you need to do is read a bit more of its content to understand it. <br /> <br /> What I also like is that everything is not synonymous with punchline. For those who expect a joke formulated as Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to realize her humor that is more realistic. We do not walk in this world and we have spiritual lines of force for all that is said, which is in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in that sense. <br /> <br /> Do not take it for stupid humor, it's so much more than that.
