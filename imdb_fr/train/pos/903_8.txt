Honestly, I can say that I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family movies. I am far from being a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director's last film (MPKDH) was completely stupid, and the music was very boring and sweet, but there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na, Seema Biswas, Alok Nath, and Anupam Kher. are very good. <br /> <br /> I finally saw the movie and was very impressed, he introduces the young MPK lovers with a pinch of the marriage of HAHK, and we have a winner The scenario is similar to HAHK, light at the beginning and serious at the end.The director also created a character you can understand.What I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance It is a major improvement, and most importantly the role is the best Amrita Rao is best, in fact, it is his best performance. screen is so electrifying, you will love his performance: Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are terribly melted. Not a single actor feels out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty disappointing but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are beautiful ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice to watch. The songs are neither colored nor danced and are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who will surely remind you of HSSH and HAHK. So, what was the flaw in the movie? The film becomes quite slow and the end is quite tense. But the film is still moving at a good pace, making it a perfect family film.
