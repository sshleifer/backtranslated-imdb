I read over a hundred books by Nancy Drew, and if you're not bright enough to understand, Nancy Drew the movie was from a YOUNG Nancy Drew, not the 18-year-old who was not going to school books are about. It was when she was sixteen. So, of course, she would not have been as smart as the book, since she is only in Grade 10. Apart from that, I found the movie very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was funny sometimes. I thought Emma Roberts did a good job. She was articulate, of character and cute. I liked the embarrassment that Nancy and Ned had for each other because they were obviously not old enough to maintain a serious relationship like in books. It was a nice PG movie that I liked because, unlike most people my age, I enjoy movies without sex, without drugs or profanity.
