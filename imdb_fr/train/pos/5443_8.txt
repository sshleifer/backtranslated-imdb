For what it is, it's a very good movie. I like both Johns -Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give excellent performances. The interest of love is OK, but it's more of a movie than a good date movie. I love the Harleys and I hated seeing them paint over the "14 layers of hand-rubbed lacquer" with the good old Olive Drab army. There is a little history lesson here in which Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in the Second World War. I do not know if the training looked like this one! The film kept my interest throughout my journey, without slowing down anywhere, with good action sequences. I like to look at the demographics of the voting history - an 18-year-old man gave the movie a 10 (real bike lover, I guess). I would not give him a 10, but I gave him a 8. I do not weigh all the movies with the same scale. There are big budget movies, with big actors, that you expect to be good, so when they fail, they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved SW's first three movies, but I thought the episode was low in comparison. So, my rating is lower than this movie. I'm expecting more from George Lucas.
