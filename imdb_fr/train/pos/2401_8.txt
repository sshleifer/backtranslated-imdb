Guy Kibbee makes the audience laugh. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a very underrated actor, is superb in giving instructions to Kibbee; that is to say, it teaches him to say something that does not mean anything to the electoral public. A campaign without comments "I will take the matter under advisement" and "Maybe yes, but again maybe not" is the almost perfect way to win an election. In summary, the more stupid the candidate is, the more likely he is to win. After all, the public can identify with such a person. As for the film, it's a lot of comedy.
