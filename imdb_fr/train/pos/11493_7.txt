The Unborn is a very good, low-budget horror film exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy. It's still very well played by Brooke Adams and James Karen, the mainstay of the movie series, although the secondary cast is rather average for a level classifier. Gary Numan's music is excellent too. Henry Dominic's script is clever enough for this kind of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. Rodman Fender's instructions are simply adequate and there are unnecessary, inexpensive alarms. If you are a fan of Adams, whose career in the cinema is not as illustrious as it should be, take a look at it; she's great, as always.
