Well, maybe not right before the riots of Rodney King, but even a few months ago were enough. My parents said they saw it and the next thing you know, the police were acquitted and LA was burned down. It just shows the state of race relations in America. The plot has white Mack (Kevin Kline) and the African-American Simon (Danny Glover) become friends after Simon saves Mack's life in the black ghetto. Meanwhile, film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks the gratuitous violence is really cool ... until he gets shot. There is also some existentialism in the film: Mack and his family realize that they do not live as they really want. <br /> <br /> It seems that "Crash" has somewhat revived people's interest in race relations, but it came out much sooner. Maybe we will never have stable race relations in this country. But in any case, "Grand Canyon" is an excellent film. He says Kevin Kline is my favorite actor. With Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
