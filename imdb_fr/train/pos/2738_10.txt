I have not seen this for over 20 years but I still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This movie could NOT have been done in color. These are the gray stark that make it and life was so simple in the 1950s ?? What strikes me the most in my memory is Perry Smith who goes to the gallows. His breathing under the hood just before they jump the trap. I do not think I could look again ..... once, that's a lot. It's like this anonymous guy at the beginning of "Butterfly" who is dragged into terror by the guillotine. The guy who said watching this on a double bill with "Dead Man Walking" should have also added the last 10 minutes of "I want to live". <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors being "aristos" went to the guillotine from 1794 to 1795 so my feelings about the death penalty are rather intense.
