This is a very good movie, not only for Lady Death comic fans, but also for those who love animated movies / adventure and fantasy series. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl who is about to be killed for something she did not do, but for whom she is daughter of the ruler of hell , Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then she seeks revenge ... and the rest, you'd better see it in the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, the characters are like the original comics, Chaos form. I never had the opportunity to read the first parts of the story in the comics, only the last, after the passages of the film. So I can not tell you if the events are exactly like comics, but ... one way or another another is the story of Lady Death!
