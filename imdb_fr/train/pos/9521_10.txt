I think this film is brilliant. There are many reasons for this, but there are among them 1) the good interpretation of Tom and Tyler 2) the brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of genius 3) I thought the end was a good Twist because that I never expected all the credits back to Sam Mendes. The shape of the film is also good. I am a student of cinema at the university and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films I have seen for many years. I would just like to say a big thank you to everyone involved in making this film. Finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is the machine gun scene where John Rooney gets killed, it's just great to turn the scene silently until John Rooney says, "I'm glad this either you "is much better like that I think because the viewer creates his own sound and the sound is totally different for each viewer simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> thank you for reading this review written by 16 year old Ross Kirk
