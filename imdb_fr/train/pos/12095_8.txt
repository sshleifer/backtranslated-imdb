When the American author Edgar Allan Poe goes to London, he is approached by the British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a particular bet. Not believing in Poe's claim that all his macabre stories are based on actual experience, Foster accepts the bet of Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he can not spend an entire night in the haunted castle of Blackwood. Once settled in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by several handsome women and men and a metaphysical doctor - which explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay stories their disappearances. the anniversary of their death! The first time I watched this glorious piece of classic horror, I was hypnotized all the time. I found the film really scary and at the same time painful. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. The score creates an atmosphere twice as frightened. The topless scene threw me a loop because I did not expect it. It seems that Synapse has done a good job of improving images, because this movie looks great for its age, and it's the Uncut International version, to boot. This is the film responsible for my collection of Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
