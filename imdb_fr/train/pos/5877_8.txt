Okay, this movie is fine as I said, but you must watch it, because it's worth watching. These are two boys Mac and Sam who are great friends and who work as fashion photographers. The laughing season begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts out with 3 flight attendant at the same time, leaving his wife suspicious. Sam makes a fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely. But Mac thinks so-and-so is starting to attend a flight attendant. there is a garam masala at every stage of the film, rock songs but something is missing. Comedy is not up to par and deserves a prize. It's nice but not that great. Some people laughed until stomach pains, but it did not deserve a lot of laughter. But of course everyone's opinion is different. So, if you want to watch the movie, you can do it.
