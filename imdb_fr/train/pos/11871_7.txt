Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE draws a picture hard to forget. Al Pacino performs a breathtaking performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self-styled crime kingdom in Florida. This gangster movie is hard, violent, loud, rude, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word "f - k" the greatest number of times. Almost three hours, and yes, it can become repulsive. A firm-hearted constitution keeps you in your seat by encouraging the disappearance of a merciless crime lord. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino turns out to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring to his character a reality that leaves a strong impression. It will not be a movie for everyone because you will leave thinking that you have left a disaster. Is it powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay long!
