David Duchovney creates a role that he had to reproduce somewhat in Californication: the troubled talent. And that's a role he plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and leads you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a good villain and Angelina Jolie stinks. The story of a disgraced doctor who makes his way into a criminal world is well written. The addiction and desire of the sensual Jolie mix an intoxicating cocktail. Unfortunately towards the end, the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between the bad guys and the FBI get confused and rush as if they were only created to develop the final scene. But, other than that, a film that is worth seeing.
