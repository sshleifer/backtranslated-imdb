I found this show very late at night and I tried it. It's a refreshing change from other types of things shown late at night, if you know what I mean. The simplicity of his values ​​and the sweetness of his heart help me remember the nature of friendships as a child. It's something that interests me every time I find it (which is rare, I should maybe even check the ads!) Haha) ... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so pretty. Like any good girl movie, you are really emotionally involved in the characters. The good old Louisa May Alcott continues to inspire good stories :) So, apparently, I have to complete 10 lines of text for my opinion to be valid, so I guess I'll tell you a little more. The children are performed by talented actors and actresses, and the sets are charming and full of nature - something else you do not see much on TV. I hope everyone tries their luck. I recognize and I am fully aware that it's ugly, but it's good heart. As I said before, it's refreshing.
