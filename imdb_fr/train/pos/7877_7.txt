The Writing Word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What the brave and brilliant Madhur Bhandarkar does is destroy the myth of the glamor and glitter that colors the pages of our newspapers and whose lives we follow (read the party's habits) with such a manic fervor that only our Intrinsic voyeuristic trend can explain. . <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is as deplorable as it is enigmatic. How exactly did he get such control over the printed text and when did he begin to encroach on the first page is he subject to another debate? Bhandarkar avoids it intelligently. He is only interested in the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in doing so, he brings together the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman (though I do not compare Bhandarkar to Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses a myriad of characters to advance his motives. Whether it's an NRI on page 3, detractors, the new rich, a future model, a mundane politician or a new erotic author; all characters are introduced with a goal and each of them has a separate character sketch, even though their parts may be tiny. And that's where the film's appeal lies. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a talented young journalist who covers page 3 of Nation Today. At first satisfied with her work, she soon begins to see the ugliness of this belly covered with its fake and cosmetic profanation. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to turn this subject into a film of law and order and avoids focusing on one character. The film does not only deal with Madhavi, but also with Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - the editor of Madhavi, who passively accepts his role of redness of a larger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a social suffocated by social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a homosexual makeup artist and her Madhavi roommate, Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - the sassy stewardess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) in a story, but all the credit goes to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for writing a tight screenplay. The dialogues of Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any story, however good, can fall flat with the lack of authentic performances. Fortunately, "Page 3" is full of actors and not stars. Konkona goes through his role supported by the author with ease without effort. Same as Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best part written, but actually too much. Atul Kulkarni is ruined however with a subscribed character. Sometimes the director seems too inclined to integrate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them seem in a hurry. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism, but it goes even further. He takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the horrible realities of this sect of humanity that seems strangely living in a different and distant world. These are the same people who gave birth to the New Year festivities while their compatriots were ravaged by the ferocity of nature a few hundred kilometers away! Intelligent writing, cleverly incorporated songs, skillful performances and a genuine sense of sincerity are the assets that make this film worthy of the name despite its lack of finesse and poor production values. "Page 3" is an optimal way to enter a new year of cinema. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Rating - **** <br /> <br /> * Mediocre ** Average *** Good **** Very good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
