If you want to have fun with a lot of subtle humor, then you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why someone would not appreciate this one. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to make fun of your head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's done well. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely gorgeous and does well in this one - better than any other episode of Baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor. Too bad she did not have many opportunities to develop this. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger adapts perfectly to his role of "true marine" and William McNamara does a solid work of executioner. <br /> <br /> Launch a Hopper ride right in the middle of the hunt for "The Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a film that caught my attention and made me laugh. I bought this one as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> A brain candy.
