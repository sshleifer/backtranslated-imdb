If you like cars, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some great actors in the movie, especially Vinnie Jones, with her typical sensual attitude and hardcase appearance. . <br /> <br /> This film has only two minor flaws. First, the plot is poor, however people do not watch this movie for intrigue. Second, the glorification of Grand Theft Auto. However, if people really believe that they can steal a Ferrari and get by, then look at them well, hope you'll have a good time in jail! <br /> <br /> When I read for the first time that Nicolas Cage had to act as the main role, I thought at first "... sweeet", but then I said to myself "... naaaa tu fear! " but finally, after watching the film, I realized "... yes, he is afraid!" I'm kidding, but he plays the role very well. <br /> <br /> I will end this unusual criticism by saying "If the premature disappearance of a criminal has somehow enlightened the audience of the cinema in general on the sad finish below the glossy varnish of criminal life , and inspired him to change his habits, then this death is accompanied by an inherent nobility and supreme glory.You can say, "Poor criminal." I say, "Poor us." <br /> < br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight is very pretty!
