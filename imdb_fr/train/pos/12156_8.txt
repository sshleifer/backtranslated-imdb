Some of the details of this story's history are based, very vaguely, on actual events from the time it was placed. The story combines some of the details of the Leopold and Loeb affair with a bit of Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the departure of two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) courtroom. The crowd seems intent on inflicting bodily harm on them while their sons have just been convicted of a thrilling crime. Someone in the crowd apparently hits Winters' hand as she heads for a waiting car. <br /> <br /> Shortly after arriving home, they begin to receive threatening phone calls. Reynolds suggests moving both to the west. Coast together and open a dance school. The dance school is a success and it hosts incredibly heinous parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these spoiled kids is a billionaire passionate about Reynolds and they start dating. Life seems very good. But when the threatening phone calls resume, Winters reacts by turning around - she behaves as if she is about to take a psychotic break and she is retreating more and more into religion - listening to the radio "Sister Alma" almost constantly. Again and again, you see the winters on edge and this leads to very bad things !! I will not say more, because it could spoil this captivating and interesting film. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is very similar to the 1960s horror movies of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford such as "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Straight-Jacket" and "The Nanny ". Although none of them are an intellectual product, they are immensely entertaining and kitschy. The writing is very good and there are some twists in the end that make it all very exciting. Winters is great as a fragile and insane woman and Reynolds is one of the sexiest women I've ever seen - and she can really, really dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern about all of this is that some might find Winters hyper-religiosity in the film a little fishy - as a cheap attack on Christianity. At first I felt that, but when you meet Sister Alma, she seems sincere and does not make fun of me. So I took the religious zeal of Winters as a mere sign of madness - which, I suppose, is all that was planned. <Br/> <br /> By the way, this movie is packed with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" - another horror film from Shelley Winters dating from 1971. Both are very funny ... and completely exaggerated!
