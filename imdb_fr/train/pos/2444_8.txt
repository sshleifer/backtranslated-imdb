"GEORGE LOPEZ", in my opinion, is an absolute classic of ABC! I have not seen all the episodes, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) got into a moving machine. If you want to know why, you must have seen it yourself. Before closing, I would like to say that everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes well designed and the writing still very strong. In conclusion, even if new episodes can currently be seen, I strongly recommend you watch them in case it disappears permanently.
