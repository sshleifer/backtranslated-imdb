I caught this movie during a test screening. Was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story. Well done. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The main male role was great. Very funny movie. It takes place in the best places in New York. Made me want to go there. I just saw "You have a mail" and I thought "It was good for you" was a better story. Fresher. <br /> <br /> It was clean and great for the whole family. I think everything will be fine Public I saw it with it I loved it.
