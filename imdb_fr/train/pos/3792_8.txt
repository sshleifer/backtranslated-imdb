I saw this movie earlier in the day and was amazed by the accuracy of the dialogue for the main characters. It did not look like a movie, but rather a documentary (the part I preferred). The main women in this film seemed to me as real as all the fifteen-year-old girls I know. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a very enjoyable film for independent film lovers.
