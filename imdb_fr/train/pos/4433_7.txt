The Story: On the Isle of Texel, photographer Bob, who is doing a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. His free spirit and thirst for life intrigue Bob, who has had a very traumatic experience not long before. His life is not as simple as it seems. Thanks to Kathleen, Bob is entangled in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to earn her trust? <br /> <br /> Criticism: The dialogue in this film is very natural and the story runs smoothly, even if it stays a little on the surface and it would have been nice if the psychology character "would have been a bit more developed. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? That's what gives me a depth of film and a reflection in my opinion. The story never reaches its emotional climax, even if the characters do enough to justify it. So that you do not know the characters of this level deeper. The actors do a good job and play in a very natural and "credible" way, but I think it would have been better for the film if Kathleen had been played by a young actress, because the naivety of this character does not really work for a adult. up woman. The camera work is good, and there are some great pictures of nature on the island. I give the film a 7/10.
