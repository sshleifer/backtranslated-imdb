Garde à Vue must be seen several times in order to understand the subplots it contains. If you're not used to verbose French movies, based on conversation and the battle of intelligence rather than on action, do not even try to watch it. You will only be bored to death and reassure the opinion that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a verbose film, essentially based on dialogues (written by Audiard for that matter) and cruelly cut the veil of appearances. <br /> <br /> Why does Master Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a murderous child rather than telling the truth? At the time of the murder, he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he had an 8-year relationship. His wife knows it, she is jealous and he prefers to be executed (in France, the death penalty still existed in France) rather than revealing the only aspect "pure and innocent" of his miserable life.
