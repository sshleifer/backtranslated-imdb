This movie is beautifully designed! There are no defects. Not in the design of the whole, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game in which participants have a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is at his best in this role. His manners, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without wrong note. Every shot meticulously done! Surprises arise one after the other when the film exceeds its first hour. It may not be the best photo of the year, but it is a jewel that has been very well polished. It's not for the simple mind.
