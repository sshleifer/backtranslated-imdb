It's not an artist's film, it's a mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Many beautiful people, t & a and action. I found it very amusing. It's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Chace are funny too, which is just sauce. It's really worth being rented. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I would advise you to go there for a little entertainment on Friday night with the boys or even with your daughter (if she likes to see other girls enjoy it!) <br /> The bad guys are good too. Vinnie, Corey Large, the hatian guy from Heroes. Bad bad guys.
