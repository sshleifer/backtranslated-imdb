This movie works because it feels really authentic. The story is simple and realistic, perfectly reflecting the joys and anxieties of teenage love and sexuality that most people have experienced during our teenage years. <br /> <br /> The actors are as natural as characters in a documentary as convincing and charismatic as experienced artists. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thankfully, it's not packed with cutesy references to pop culture. In addition, cinematography is both fine and beautiful, giving a very tangible impression of the Lower East Side. <br /> <br /> From an artistic point of view, I like this film because it reminds me of the great Italian neo. Realism films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Movies rarely feel as "real" as that ... or as Bicycle Thief did. And the only other film I've seen dealing with teenage sex with the same seriousness is Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass. Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves praise. This film is a real feat. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I am always happy to see a film that treats members of the American ethnic group with love and respect. As a French-American, I hate the way my own people get noticed in the movies (racist geniuses, criminalizers, criminal geniuses in irritating and popular epics), and my annoyance on this point makes me extremely sensitive to other groups. and their terrible silver screen. representations. Hispanics and Asians in particular seem cursed to play villains in westerns and action movies. (Fortunately, Gong Li did not try to make himself known in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks in large part to the rise of independent images and the influence of Miramax, we let's see some more pictures about ethnic characters here and there ... but Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. Even though I really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Raising Victor Vargas is playing straight (with less exaggerated and more general characters) while still being fun. Finally! Latino characters worthy of mention. I feel like it's a movie that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that he has made this wonderful picture of a family from the Dominican Republic, I hope Peter Sollett will succeed in filming on the Italians soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
