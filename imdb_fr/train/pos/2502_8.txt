This film surprised me! Having never heard of Hyde of Gackt, I was not expecting much! I wanted to watch this movie because someone mentioned that the film contained serious action scenes in the style of John Woo! Normally I am very careful when it is claimed! There is only one John Woo and so far no director has been as brilliant as his talent for action! The fact that "Moon Child" presents a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with flaming vampires! It sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed in this movie is that the pace was very slow! It takes time to create the atmosphere! This film contains beautiful action scenes in Hong Kong! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama of friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship with each other! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do good acting work and are very believable as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! Sometimes, the film seems to jump a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to jump! Example: When a gang member dies (very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking the blood of one of the attackers! Without warning or explanation, the film jumps 9 nine years and most friends are no longer together! Also, without proper reason, His (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) must kill each other! I know this is done to add a serious drama! Thanks to the actors, it's very effective but sometimes you feel forced! In addition to the flaws of the plot, this film has an atmosphere and fluidity that makes it difficult not to like this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is wonderful! But it's just! The overall experience you get is comforting and sincere!
