Looked like a TV movie late last night, purely by chance. The presentation text of the film indicated that the mother stayed with her daughter and continued her romantic journey. The carpenter was already working on the construction of a new conservatory - played by Daniel Craig - and the plot was immediately apparent. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the love affair of the carpenter of the eponymous mother is also the boyfriend of the girl. There is therefore trouble to brew and not too many surprises. But I was surprised by the convincing performance of Anne Reid and I was addicted. The management gives him plenty of time to look in the mirrors and adjust his scarves when she breathes sadness. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes are fascinating and turn into taboos. Should not older women's bodies stay covered? Not here and we are treated to a delicious awakening in the mother's sexuality. Even more surprising are the drawings she made once discovered (SPOILER!) Confirm her daughter's suspicions that something is happening here. <br /> <br /> Cathryn Bradshaw, her daughter did not convince me as much as the rest of the world. the casting, but it could be me. With his waves of locks before Raph, I was still expecting to see Julia Sawahla, whose more intense face would have been more appropriate to the clashes. Bradshaw has a happier, rounder face that does not carry the anger that emerges as the film moves on. <br /> <br /> The end is weak. If Mother's farewells at the moment she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent, we could perhaps see close-ups of those who bid farewell and see something of their individual reasons. Whatever she did, she is a recently bereaved widow who leaves for the isolated house she shares with her husband for 30 years, and I found the lack of sympathy. For a film as emotionally charged (and know that it's as if you open champagne, you will never find the cover), the end is a cold contradiction.
