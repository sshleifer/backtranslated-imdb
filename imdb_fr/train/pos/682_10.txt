It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and while it may be slow for some, it's worth watching. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is involved in a case involving "townspeople", and this is not an ordinary case. OK, a man died but it was not really a normal killing. In recent years, the amount of rain has also been above average and the atmosphere of most films is somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. The Aborigines have a secret and refuse to reverse the situation. This has a lot to do with white men who make assumptions about "City" vs. "tribal" Aborigines, and of course, no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways. Uh huh. Chamberlain makes strange dreams and he's kind of the key to what's going on, although no matter how many times I've seen that, I can not quite understand the exact connection. This is a very disturbing and scary movie, and is a fine example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from scratch. The end is a bit ambiguous but I literally take it, it's the easiest way out and the scariest. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
