The film I will review is a small TV movie directed in 1996 and starring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. <br /> <br /> Main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager. who feels the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets a former prisoner named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never been kissed"), they "fall" on each other, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to take their relationship . she manipulates him to kill his parents, to protect their "love", but she simply used him to get rid of his parents so he could be with Brad (David Lascher, future casting mate of "Sabrina" for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart really surprised me with her role as evil manipulator and she wears the movie using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the actors work well and they manage when they have time on the screen. I also found it interesting that this film was shot and released the same year, Hart, described Sabrina, the teenage witch, which shows that she can play in my film and television genres. <br /> <br /> Although the film has a little dated, but it is considered one of his best works in the field of drama or thriller. I look forward to "Nine Dead", which will be released in November, as it shows that she can be seen as someone other than "Clarissa Darling". or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all fans of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina.You can watch it on the Internet, so I suggest you consult it.
