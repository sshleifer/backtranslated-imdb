This is my favorite movie every time. It was my Friday night movie with a pizza and a bottle of wine when I was single. I first saw this film with my Aunt Brend and my sister Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend. I read a lot of comments on why Bud left Sissy and how Sissy has to "learn to play" bride. But let's go back and look at this for a moment: SPOILER - My interpretation of the film now is not when I was eight, it's about Bud & Sissy's relationship that turns out worse because she make fun of him at Gilley. Taurus. They fight a lot. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then thinks that two wrongs will be right and Wes asks her if "she needs help". They are all on the dance floor and behave like fools when Bud asks Pam: "When are you going to take me home and rape me?" Pam answers, "When you're ready Cowboy". Bud then returns with Pam to his apartment in downtown Houston. What dad bought for her with his money and "all that implies". Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy. Sissy expects Bud when he returns home the next day. Sissy is the one leaving Bud. Then it is up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he is a real "cowboy" and to win her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has theirs I'm sure! I love that movie. <br /> <br /> And believe it or not, I bought myself a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
