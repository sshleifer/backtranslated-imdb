It is a very strange movie of HK in many ways. First, a lot of action sequences are really not very fun. The very first shooting in the movie was ridiculous. Not cool silly, or even silly funny, but just silly. This is not to say that there are no great action scenes, but most of the time, they do not reach the level of some of the other movies I've seen. The opposite side is that this movie actually has characters, not just characters. All the main characters are interesting (with the exception of the chief villain, who is flat like a pool) and most are pretty well played. All the protagonists of this film are fun to watch. The dialogue is quite spiritual and does not seem to lose much in translation. This film is worth seeing, but I hope the uninitiated American public will not think it's the best HK has to offer.
