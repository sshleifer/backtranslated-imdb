Who does not have unresolved problems with parents? And which parents do not have unresolved problems with each other? <br /> <br /> I know, it seems heavy. But this is played to laugh in the film, thus improving comedy and drama. I've always loved Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a little movie, I was delighted from the first scene. <br /> <br /> Mostly fun. were the discoveries that the son makes of his father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue about being a father and a hardworking, sacrificing husband was the perfect balance point. Without this scene, the film would have seemed much less nuanced and the character much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
