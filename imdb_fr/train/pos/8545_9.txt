Overall, I found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch, with lots of laughing moments. <br /> <br /> But this film is not for everyone. That's why I created this little question-era, if you answer yes to any of the following questions, I recommend watching this movie <br /> <br /> (1) Do you like raw sexual humor? (2) Do you like the humor associated with alcohol? (2) Do you like incredibly hot girls? (3) Do you like to see breasts? (4) Do you like to see more breasts? (5) Did I mention all the crazy people in this movie? <br /> <br /> If you've noticed the spoiler alert, that's the amount of nudity you can expect in the movie, I have no idea what the plot was about. Not that matters.
