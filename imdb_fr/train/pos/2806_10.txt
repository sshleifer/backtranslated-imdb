Okay, I hate to comment on this thing first, but I felt compelled to stand up for it. So many people wanted it and I felt that those who would like to see it should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First of all, Bend It Like Beckham is not supposed to be the deepest movie in the world. century. If that's what you're looking for, go elsewhere. The fact that it is an independent film does not mean that it has to be artistic. It's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and these two things are accomplished with ease. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the acting but not the "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is always good. The film does not have to act like that honestly, so do not look for it. It's a family film. If that's what you want, you would not want or should not even honestly dive into this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, he has a really cute story. I think it's well thought out and it's fun to watch. It's also very true to life for most people in this culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you're looking for something with thoughtful intrigue and big dramatic scenes, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
