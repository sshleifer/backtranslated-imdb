This film is actually relevant even today, given the threat of bioterrorism and the threats of super bacteria, West Nile virus and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than useful in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot. The actor in this film that has most left its mark is Jack Palance. His well-defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior are still retracting to reveal the miserly and cruel man beneath the surface. The chase scene across the packaging plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
