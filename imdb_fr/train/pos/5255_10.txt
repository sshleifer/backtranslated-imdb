Tim Meadows must be the most underrated of SNL cast members. What was initially a low glance on a fishy gigilo turns into a completely entertaining race of 90 minutes, though still low. Do not wait for this one to wait for beautiful cinematographic performances or worthy of an Oscar. Expect Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell to do what they do best, to make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Man of the Ladies" Phelps is a na√Øve and friendly TV broadcaster who knows very little about the wang's manners. As a talented man of women, he drops the women of countless men who have regrouped to chase him. The director accomplishes an inspiring work by guiding the actors in a comic rendezvous that completely compensates for the lack of development of the plot. How many parcels could we expect from a SNL skit? While some of the scenes are a little out of sync, most of the time, Meadows' nonsense and nonsensical sex comments are just plain funny. For example, in one scene, Meadows compares to Mother Teresa, but for happiness. Of course it's bullshit, but are not we all in the privacy of our house laughing a bit of his advice to a whole city for "letting it fall in the ass"? In another scene, immediately after a sincere kiss from the woman, he suddenly remembers that his name would be a benefactor, a woman with whom he slept years ago. He gets up in front of the woman who has obviously fallen in love with him and proclaims that "the man with the women is back" to his great sorrow. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams hits the ball out of the park while bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell, the repressed homosexual, completes his performances. <br /> <br /> See this film if you are a fan of adult humor. Otherwise, move away from extreme prejudices.
