Not to be confused with high-school film Resse Witherspoon of the same name, this is a stylized look at triad gangs in Hong Kong. Called election because a new leader or "president" is elected every two years according to ancient traditions. Two candidates are in the running for the position. Thanks to their ego, their bribes and their antecedents, the race is at least tense. Specially directed to present you an important casting without never confusing the twists of the history before revealing itself in all its brutal glory. This is not the case for the Asian godfather, but it's a nice thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing with violence. Subtitle Volume 1 I think it is safe to say that there will be other payments as we deepen the troubled world of triads and all their fierce and underhand trade deals. Anyway, it's a good start and, if there are no sequels, a big movie in its own right.
