"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The nineties are opening with a clever Disney favorite, "TaleSpin", a series of TV cartoons featuring characters from "The Jungle Book". Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly the sea duck as you've never seen it before: from Cape Suzette to Louie's, in the mountains, through the jungle, on the water, on volcanoes, at the search for adventure, looking for treasure, looking for fun, all in a cartoon adventure packed with action !!!!! <br /> <br /> It was one of my favorites as well as those of my family. This was broadcast during the Disney afternoon throughout the first half of the 1990s, until the original cartoons were transferred to Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I saw on vacation once in 1996 before receiving the cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: today DVDs are here !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Dun, Dun, Dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
