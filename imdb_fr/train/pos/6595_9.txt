I borrowed this film from a friend who knew nothing about it and who turned out to be an exceptional documentary about a trip aboard an old ship across vast expanses of the ocean. Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas of Peru had managed to travel thousands of kilometers from the ocean in Polynesia, based on some remains found in both places, on some types of ancient seagoing ships that we we know that they had, analysis of ocean currents and winds, and knowledge that the Incas actually traveled at sea in an undetermined quantity. <br /> <br /> In order to verify his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew build a ship to the extent of the possibilities of the ancient Incas, using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time, and is left Lima, the capital of Peru, to try to reach the islands of Polynesia, 5,000 km away. His theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with absolute certainty, but the coverage of their course provides a solid argument that he is right. The film is really little more than a narration of images taken during the expedition of more than 100 days, but it is a very detailed description of what it looked like and the trials and tribulations to which they were face. I often want Oscar-winning documentaries to be easier to find, and this one, dating back more than 50 years, is as interesting and informative as I'm sure it was on its first release.
