The Virgin, 40, tells the story of Andy Stitzer, a forty-year-old man who works in an electronics store and does not have a social life and is very embarrassed for women. Some of his colleagues at the store invite him out one night and discover that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day, in the store, Andy, meets a woman named Trish, who gives him his phone number and who ends up having enough courage to go out with her. They start to really love each other, but Andy is still very embarrassing when it comes to sex and he'll have to tell Trish, which makes him all the more embarrassed if he can get up enough courage to tell him before things get embarrassing. The Virgin, 40, has a good direction, a good script, good comic performances from the actors, a good cinematography and a good editing. The film stars and is co-written by Steve Carell, who achieves a very good comic breakthrough performance. His writing for the film is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. It's sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, smart, cheerful and a good time. This film is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. The 40-year-old Virgin is very talented and well used. She works like a comedy and a romance and she is sweet and funny. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
