'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with the original release in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand that, just a little bit. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York to become a hustler is sometimes a bit disturbing. Dressed as a cowboy, he tries to live like a scammer and earns money by act of love. It does not work as he had planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso', Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first played him a trick and stole money from him, they became friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make money. <br /> <br /> The film was probably rated X for the main subject, but we see strange things along the way. The editing in this film is great. We see scenes of dreams of Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a fun and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and supporting actors give excellent performances. Above all, Hoffman delivers some beautiful, famous lines. The score is made by John Barry and sounds good. All this makes this film an excellent film that won the Oscar for best film for a good reason.
