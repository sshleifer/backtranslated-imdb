I saw it last night on TV and I was pretty happy. <br /> <br /> It's kind of the film that makes you feel warm and warm, and you think there's still goodness in the world (all the neighbors have claimed do not see what grace did to help her and protect her (the old police officer is my favorite), even if you know this story is not realistic, I loved playing (they all seemed like ordinary people, live in small picturesque English coastal town) but the biggest thing in the movie was his wit and humor! Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after having their "tea" !! <br /> <br /> Maybe the end was a bit confusing, but that did not stop me from really, really enjoying the whole Story!
