David Aames is a handsome rich guy who lives in New York. When her "sleeping partner," Julie Gianni, becomes very jealous after the fall of Spanish beauty Sofia, David takes her in his car and tells him he's the only guy she likes and wants to be with, but seeing that he is in love with Sofia, she decides to commit suicide with David in the car with her, crossing a bridge. David survives the crash, but he remains a disfigured face. He is then charged with the murder of Julie. The fact is that David does not know what's real and what's not, because he's still having these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares.) And flashbacks, some of which have everything just no sense for him. But everything will come back to him soon as he begins to discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Well, there's a cast of stars here, including Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor who all give good performances in the film. In the film, they all put forward different things about their characters, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. There's also a cameo in the awesome Steven Spielberg movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a well made, different, interesting and original film that will leave you a lot to talk about when you're done. It's not just a thriller, but a true psychological thriller. The movie trailer is really good, but the movie is so different from what it might look like. It was very well done and there were some very beautiful scenes here too. All in all, it's a nice film that you really have to pay attention to. They are sure to make a lot of movies "Are they dead, if not dead" recently.
