I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone to have a good time. Do not take the film too seriously because remember it's Disney and it's rated G. It's a lot of fun, although some parts can be recognized by adults but kids will never notice it, especially the "triangle" between Cruella, The Pelt and the followers of Cruella valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really adopted Cruella and is terribly terrifying even if she is "cured" of her love of fur. It can sow fear in the public with its strides that literally shake the theater. (I even found myself jumping on my seat when she surprises you with her "bipolarity" as a loving Ella dog.) In the end, I'll go see him again in the theaters, I found myself at home. to appreciate so much.
