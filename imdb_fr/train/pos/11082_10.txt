I watched this film while I was almost a child and, naturally, I was moved to tears by this story of a family of foxes. The fantastic landscapes of Hokkaido, the excellent narrative narrative and especially the wonderful soundtrack offer a rare intimacy to the protagonists. I am always looking for a copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers, it may be useful to know that the DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to. I recorded both (DEFA and BR) but I only look at the first one.
