It's been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action movie. I watched this movie about 10 times and it's a great effort from Gautham. From my point of view, I think this film is virtually flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan - undoubtedly..classy.Jyothika has played very well his role as Maya.The character suits him very well.The character who caught the attention of moviegoers was Pandia.Jeevan played very well the role of Pandia.Brutal and fearsome .Jeevan was rightly awarded the best villain award at the ITFA 2004. The actors of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others played well. <br /> <br /> A sharp story, perfectly synchronized dialogues and a brilliant narrative of Gautham.The soundtrack of Harris Jeyaraj are all jammers while the BGM is very suitable for the film.RAD Rajasekhar's cinematography is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the waterfall. Anthony's editing is accurate. Above all, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect crime movie filled with action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... without a doubt.
