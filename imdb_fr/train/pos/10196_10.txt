Congratulations to Cesar Montano for relaunching Cebuano! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - he has the drama, the action, the romance and the scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Although the story is not so original (a love triangle - or a love four corners, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), his presentation is something cool, especially since she uses her original language - bisaya for Filipinos, nipongo for Japanese and English for Americans. <br /> This movie will be one of this year's best Pinoy movies. <br /> <br /> Go watch it!
