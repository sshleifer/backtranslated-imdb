It's a shame that this TV-derived series inspired by the high-quality television images "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" lasted only one season and twenty episodes, because at its best, this program offered a winning and highly entertaining mix of keen cynical humor (Carl Kolchak's passionate verbal fights with the ever-irascible and persistent editor have always been a treat to watch and hear), intelligent writing, clever supernatural threats ( you have to love the quirky and original creations in "The Spanish Moss Murders", "The Sentry" and "Horror in the Heights", and you can not go wrong with frightened characters like zombies, vampires, wolves- Weres and witches), colorful characters, vivid actor of a group of stunning stars (the legendary icon of biker movies, William Smith, has had the rare opportunity to heroic lead in "The Energy Eater", while other episodes featured great veteran characters like Keenan Wynn, John Fiedler, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in juicy roles), moments of true suspense (the culmination of "The Spanish Moss Murders", in particular, was truly heartbreaking), and best of all, the one and only Darren McGavin in top form zested as a bold, aggressive and excitable journalist, but fundamentally decent, brave and honest, Carl Kolchak, journalist from Chicago, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the quintessential protagonist of the '70s, a cunning and spirited nose with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate talent for getting into all kinds of problems. Moreover, Kolchak, who sometimes works, was anything but superhuman; he used to stumble or stumble fleeing a mortal threat, but had a certain inner strength and courage that allowed him to save the human race again and again from all kinds of deadly enemies from another world. Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of pleasant secondary characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's boss, Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage, and model Ron Updyke were perfect for a comic sheet, Ruth McDevitt was simply delightful as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles. and Carol Ann Susi was also very entertaining as rookie rookie novice Monique Marmelstein (who sadly disappeared after appearing in just three episodes). Admittedly, the series suffered from lean makeup and special effects (the lycanthrope holder of "The Werewolf" unfortunately looks like a Yorkshire terrier!) And these last episodes boasted of some ridiculous and ridiculous monsters (the headless biker of "Chopper ", Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in" The Youth Killer "), but even second-rate programming is bought by the devious and devious spirit of the program, the boundless vitality and unbridled presence of McGavin .
