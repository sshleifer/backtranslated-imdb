I'm not sure how I missed it when it came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in the red light district of Okabasho, in the nineteenth century, Japan. It tells the story of prostitution, caste systems and strong women in a society based on Japan's samurai code strength. <br /> <br /> It's only Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before he was able to make this film, his adaptation of the script is revealing. His vision of the Japanese world and the caste system is famous and sheds light on how these systems interact with one another. Characters can rotate around each other, but the caste system remains intact as each character returns to the world it belongs to. The samurai warrior who slips into the world of the prostitute with a sweet heart and full of love comes back into her life, as she embarks on another journey with a man who is part of her caste system ... the most bottom of the lowest. Many consider the world of samurai to be above all others, yet it is the lower caste people who can support themselves and who can love without constraint. The samurai in this film turn out to be the weakest, while the classless lovers turn out to be the most honorable. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. It is a story of survival of women in feudal Japan. During this period, it was thought that men were the survivors ... the strongest, while women were considered a property without spirit and weak. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and explains how they managed to survive. How did their strength allow Japanese culture to continue as before? <br /> <br /> I recommend "The sea looks" to all fans of Akira Kurosawa and even if they are not fans. This is a charming, relaxing and soul-resting film that deserves to be appreciated for any movie collection.
