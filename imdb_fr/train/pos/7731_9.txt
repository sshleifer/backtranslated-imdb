<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness. The film is slow, very slow, but takes a rhythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives a real performance), and Rachel Ward is anything but sexy. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, psychological heat, traces of the past ... flashback scenes, the strangeness of Patric's character, everything becomes a sexy mystery. I recommend this cause because it's the sexiest dull movie I've ever seen. Look at the scene of love, it's particularly sexy.
