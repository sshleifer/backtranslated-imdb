Unfortunately for me, I came across this series late in life. I only caught a few episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and the scenario - but especially the BIG actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was & The character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (De Carlito's Way: Rise to Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I enjoy seeing the young actors get their due, and I feel that this series will propel their career further. I hope at least that it will be delivered on DVD, and maybe WB will get it for a second season from time to time? In the meantime, I look at ABC's website from the beginning.
