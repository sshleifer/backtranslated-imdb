I was really surprised by this movie. Going into the preview, knowing nothing about the movie, except for the trailer I saw, I thought it would be a shit festival like Dude Where's My Car. I was expecting jokes about sex and farting and a pathetic main character who will end up getting fucked because that's how movies work. Instead, I had a clever and surprisingly original movie about a decent and average guy who just did not have sex. -mipple!, but that's a lot in the mind of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All characters are people you probably know in real life, recoverable friends who are just trying to hook up a brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I went thinking that this movie was going to be a total crap, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's pretty exaggerated (come on, it's a movie about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it's very well done. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really shoot for this man to get laid, which says a lot about the film because, honestly, do you really care that Ashton Kutcher finds his car or not?
