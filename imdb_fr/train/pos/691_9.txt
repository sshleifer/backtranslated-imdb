I will come frankly. The only reason I even learned about this DVD is that Dominic Monaghan is one of my favorite actors. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be ... different, maybe not that good. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading the few reviews published on this short film, I was really excited to see it. I sent my copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film follows Jack, an insomniac who is often plagued by diseases that make him doubt the reality and all he has in mind. I will not reveal what is happening, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes scare realism. <br /> <br /> The staging is fantastic, it focuses on the essence of the story without letting it lose any moment of entertainment or reflection. <br /> <br /> In the end, I give this great film 9 out of 10, to go far beyond what any short film could achieve.
