I'm a big fan of a fairy tale theater and I've seen them all and it's one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend it for all ages. It's good for little kids because it's good for Cinderella and for adults and teens because it's funny and not exaggerated. I watched it when I was little and I still look at it now. There are excellent lines that my family and I quote all the time. The acting is great and it never gets old. If you like fairy tales and novels, you'll love it. I watched a lot of Cinderella films in my day and it's the best of all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all the Faerie Tale Theater shows. They all enjoy all ages and are all unique and entertaining.
