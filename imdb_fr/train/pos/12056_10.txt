Although I love the haunted movies of houses like Amityville and Poltergeist, this allowed television adaptation of Susan Hills books, a huge punch on the horrors of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant cast (many of them Heartbeat and other TV series), a fantastic acting and a fantastic setting (which convincingly describes the life of the 1920s), it contains all the ingredients necessary to draw the viewer into what constitutes a powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence or blood to send shivers down the back of an audience. Using her imagination, Woman In Black is a figure of fear and fear, and her presence is never absent once she shows up. <br /> <br /> The main character Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, discovers his invisible spectrum. on his mission to settle the estate. The widow dies and Arthur spends a few nights in his sullen house in which he notices many oddities, which can haunt him for a few days. Some scenes are very disturbing and claustrophobic, especially the locked room that opens, which turns off the generator and closes Arthur in the dark. The film becomes more and more heartbreaking as you put yourself in Arthurs' shoes and his efforts to shake this ghost. The writer adds many additions to the story, such as the resurgence of the lead soldier. We can not wait to learn the meaning of all this. The fact that we never really learn much about the widow leaves more imagination and makes it even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The widow, for the most part, looks mean and intimidating. The scene after going up the generator sent me chills, a woman who appears out of nowhere on an isolated marshy land with a screaming wind ?? Having experienced such properties myself, I can understand how isolated this is. And the scene at the inn was perhaps the most horrible thing I've seen, the one I do not want to look at hurriedly or show to elderly parents. At night, I often woke up thinking that she was behind me in my sleep. <br /> <br /> The Woman In Black is an excellent TV movie and a lost jewel. I agree to a certain extent that the hype on the internet for this movie was totally exaggerated and that people were disappointed after spending the best of Â£ 50, but I think the network has defeated hidden gems as it produces movies like these overexposed. I think it's still brilliant and fantastically played and I consider it the biggest ghost story of the last century.
