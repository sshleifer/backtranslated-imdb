This film may be really bad, but it's very funny. The bad action and the bad direction accentuate the hysteria of the film. The twins are very funny in their conanic roles. If you go in this movie while waiting for the first Conan or Excalibur, you will hate it. If you look at it in a good mood and accept it as good and fun, you'll have a good time. Watch for the scene where they are trying to hang the brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. I hope Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have done it !!
