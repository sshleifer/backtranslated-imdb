This film won each of the ten votes I gave him! Thank you guys for making a movie to watch. You have shown the world, you can always write, direct, produce and play in a black film without the negative stereotypes. Poetry was also great, a hat for poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I watched her last night, while I fell in love with my darling. I will add it to my movie collection today and I will recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Keep producing quality, do not worry about the quantity .... <br /> <Thanks again, and best wishes and blessings to you!
