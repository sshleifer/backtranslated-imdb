I am a rather pedestrian, with a little low tastes. However, I sometimes try to raise the bar on my cultural conscience. This film was one of my attempts. I was impressed throughout the movie. I liked it so much that I had my own cassette so I could see it again. It is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking film. I saw this as a huge question for the viewer: how deep is the sacrifice to duty that one can accept, which one can ask to accept, what should one accept? As a military, this question is obviously important to me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
