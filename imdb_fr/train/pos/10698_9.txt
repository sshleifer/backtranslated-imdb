A funny little movie. It's totally incredible, incredible, impossible. But it's amusing to see how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and hypnotized, even hypnotized by a girl he barely knows but who has managed to indulge in his fantasies. Of course, this is a denunciation of foolishness that you can get on the Internet. You must not believe ten per cent of what you are told there and never, ever, accept to tie your hands somehow to someone, to something or to an organization that you do not know personally. Most of their "businesses" there is one way or another to fool you and attack you. But here the guy deserves to be the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is ridiculously ridiculous. But then, the movie becomes funny because it ends up giving the twisted business victim the upper hand and she ends up playing the same game with her attacker and winning. We think is sure too. The security in English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I guess it's no better anywhere in the world and even now that they have tightened all the rules and regulations, it's fun to follow their procedures and systematically outsmart them. They then take revenge by losing their luggage, a real scourge of modern airports, and do not expect fair compensation. Or even confiscating a bottle opener or can opener because it can be dangerous. I can see myself making my way through the side of the plane with a can opener. It's funny, is not it?
