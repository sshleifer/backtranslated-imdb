It's a good movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where the theory of chaos is summed up by talking about the wings of a butterfly, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, Bug is all about this (or at least something, do not worry, it's not a spoiler). I'm definitely not a religious guy and I do not believe in predestined stuff, fate, etc., but this movie is surely wondering if the coincidence really exists ... <br /> <br /> further afield , the game of actors and the camera are excellent too, another proof that it is still possible to make a good movie without zillion bucks
