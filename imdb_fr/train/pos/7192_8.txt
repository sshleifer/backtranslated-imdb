If you're a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones or action in general, it's a must. Directed by William Witney and John English, the ace of Republic, played by Reed Hadley in the role of Don Diego / Zorro, this soap opera is up to par! I will not bore you with intrigue (who cares? Less words, more fighting); What really matters here is Hadley's superb rendition of the character (s) and stunt work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the influence of this movie on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro gets caught in the original version of Star Wars trash compactor in one chapter, stuck on a rope bridge to the Temple of Doom in another, makes a transfer Raiders from horse to trainer and even runs off into a tunnel while the villains dump a huge tank of and flood the tunnel behind him, just as Mola Ram does to Indy in Temple of Doom. In addition to all this, the action of the whip is excellent since Zorro disarms the bad guys, goes to safety, etc. with his faithful whiplash. Most of the work on the swords is passable to none, except for Chapter 1, which features a terrible sword fight in a cantina choreographed by Ralph Faulkner, legend of the sword / stuntman, who makes a rare appearance at the screen like the evil Rodriguez. It was the first series I saw on Matin√©e au Bijou when I was a kid and I've been addicted to them ever since. <br /> <br /> The Zorro Fighting Legion delivers "Z" products!
