Johnny Yuma is one of the most satisfying western hitters, with the coolness of many WAIs made at the pinnacle of the genre. It is highly recommended for fans of the genre or intelligent and offbeat cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is, in most ways, not terribly original, but that does not really count against it. The success of a genre film depends on its ability to respond to public expectations and surprising variations of these expected elements. Earlier, pleasurable experiences are recreated, but with a subtle (or major) twist that arouses continued interest. The quality of execution is, of course, important. A tired retreading will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience. <br /> <br /> Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are many covers of elements from earlier films. The setting consists of the brutal and twisted semi-feudal twilight world shared by many of the best westerns of the "Gothic family" from 1964-1968, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic plot Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Ringo movies, a fact not surprising since the screenwriter Fendiando di Leo has been involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best writers of popular cinema from Cinecitta in the years 1960-1970 and his work has brought much of the thematic continuity and coherence of the genre (with some other personalities belonging to actors, directors and writers). In the FOD plot, the protagonist arrives in town, raises a tense situation, then suffers an imminent death followed by a resurrection (in some films, such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968), it is literally a crucifixion ). The Catholic connotation of narrative and symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit explicit populist / socialist tendencies of filmmakers and their films. The Ringo plot, developed in greater depth by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films featuring Guliano Gemma, a selfish protagonist, chooses a community's interest in his through a relationship with a member of that group. community (with an ironic twist uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco / Mortimer of Fistful of Dollar (1965). The two weapon belt exchange scenes provide an intelligent dialogue and understanding between the two. Many films, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, qui√©n sabe? (1967), use this relationship between an older man and a younger man (father / son, elder brother / brother, anglophone advisor / adversary and peasant revolutionist) as a central dynamic of the plot. <br /> <br /> is the focus on deception and steering errors, labyrinths and mirrors, which reoccur during WAI's best debut. The canons and pueblos of Almeria become real labyrinths in which the protagonist and the antagonist play the changing games of the cat and the mouse. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of the use of the visual / psychological space by the director Romolo Guerriri. set arrangement with the intelligent mechanisms of the script to convey the plot. Dialogue has never been very important to WAI and often absurdly incomprehensible (with some exceptions, such as cynical comments in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967). <br /> <br /> Psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic images, it is about juxtapositions and a description of the overall narrative situation. See how the presence of Samantha, a mortal person, is felt during the beat scene - watching from the rooftop or in the background of the action, Samantha and Pedro of their safety and their confidence in their power through their furtive invasions of their ranch, their hotel, or even their bedroom ( it is still a theme of the FOD) .Please note finally the importance given to the search for information.It is one of the elements borrowed from the FOD, inspired by the mysterious novel Red Harvest: accidental contacts, posters re sought-after, conversations heard, conversations through the windows, watches left at twilight t, or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative points to his conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film was outstanding at the moment were perceived as excess violence. Of course, these films were hardly more violent than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes that attributed it, that is, it was not violence but its meaning that had changed. Johnny Yuma is distinct and interesting in his use and portrayal of violence. This is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I personally most interest in this kind of music is the link it offers to the anonymous. , unnamed audiences in Italy and Spain, to whom these recurring stories have special importance and interest. The artifact may have no intrinsic value per se ?? samples of flint on a prehistoric site, a sparkle of crusty pottery or a piece of leather and rusted metal breaking? but it refers to a nameless presence, lives that were important just because they existed. Although Johnny Yuma has an intrinsic value, this interest comes largely from this connection and this mystery. <br /> <br /> List of the best Western spaghetti http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average software http://imdb.com/mymovies/ list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> For fanatics only (bottom of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849890
