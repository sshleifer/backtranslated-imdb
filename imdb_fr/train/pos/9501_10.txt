I had seen this film when it came out and when I was 12 :) And I always remember very well the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escapes every time in front of the danger :) And the best feature film was the representation of the villain! I think a lot of so-called action movies have copied a lot of "escape scenes" from this movie !! And not only does it never impress me when I see such a copy, it always increases my appreciation of this masterpiece! :) The main actors have done very well. The slow and realistic development of chemistry between hero and heroine was extremely natural and beautifully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed between them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations is something that can even make children realize of the value of true love, sacrifice and solicitude. I recommend each person to see this movie when given a chance !! --Vijay.
