My family and friends tease me all the time for my tears of movies, and they were not disappointed when I watched this one. I cried many times, but believe me, it was not too much joy. I felt bad for the family and for this man who was trying to redeem himself in the only way he knew how to do it. Denzel was fab as always, as was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize; the years have not been favorable to him. My husband is not one to watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies (snoring !!!!). He watched this movie 5 times now and I will have to get the DVD to watch it again because he wore the tape and he jumped all the time I was watching.
