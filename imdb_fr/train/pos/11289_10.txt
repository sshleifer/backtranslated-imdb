Something wonderful is the fact that a film made in 1934 can surpass all the Tarzan films that followed it, including Greystoke, a boring and boring 1980s piece. Once the viewer has passed the first three scenes, certainly boring, Tarzan and his companion take off like a ball, offering action, humor and non-stop romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful like Jane and leaves with the movie. Weismuller is solid too. Highly recommended.
