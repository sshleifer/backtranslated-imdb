I really enjoyed the first episode and can not wait to see more. A little sweetness on the front of the crime (it's almost an afterthought and not too suspensive or scattered), but I thought the angle of the romance was wonderfully charming. Will be looking again for sure! <br /> <br /> I hope they will have a bigger role for aunts who are wonderful actresses and have been a bit underused this time around. The actress who plays the assistant (also from Bewitched, I think) is very sweet and bubbly and presents herself as pretty silly and sweet instead of being silly and boring, which is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
