Well, let me say this because I love history and I know this film is the most important piece in our history. It was a beautifully executed film and Julia Stiles became my first favorite actress after seeing her in "The 60s" and I own her movie in my video box with many movies and I suggest you search her new movies at the future and try to enjoy the story !!!!
