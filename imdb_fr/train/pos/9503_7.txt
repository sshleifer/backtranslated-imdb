a bit slow and boring, the story of an old man and his wife living in a dilapidated building and interacting with a group of characters like the postman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the rich cigarhouse. The photography of the river is wonderful, as is the interior decoration of time. If you like the decoration of Banana Republic stores, this is a must.
