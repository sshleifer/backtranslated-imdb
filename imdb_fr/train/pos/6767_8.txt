When he was a teenager at the time, Airwolf was a mandatory viewing for a generation that wanted his "Cowboys and Indians" to have incredible gadgets and explosions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was essentially Knight. Rider in the heavens: similar comic book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of a man who makes the difference. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways, it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. On the one hand, the postulate of the series is not based on the desire to help those who need it, but on the possession of Airwolf by Stringfellow Hawke for essentially selfish reasons (as a way of looking for his brother MIA, St John). And then there is the dark edge provided by the base firmly of the series in a Cold War context of the 80s, supplemented by Soviet espionage and dictators of Central America, not to mention the inner enemy. Of course, Team A constantly referred to Vietnam and its fugitive status, but this was usually done with a touch of levity and was rarely at the heart of the plot. With Airwolf, the plot was the key tone and direction of the series, although it was (mis) diluted over the series. <br /> <br /> In hindsight, the Cold War framework clearly dates the series, many stories are squeaky and artificial, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible, even with the current technology. . But that's really not the point. Airwolf was amusing, he was trying to tell interesting stories not just about the big action sequences, and he had not smeared anything by miraculously making sure no one died. Sometimes it failed, but often it worked out admirably - and on a television budget. <br /> <br /> For British readers, DMAX (Sky 155 channel) has just started (January 2008) the daily reissue of Airwolf. Set your Sky + box on this explosion of the past - we could even have the fourth season redeveloped, redesigned (and unfortunately much lower), which, to my knowledge, has never been shown in the UK yet.
