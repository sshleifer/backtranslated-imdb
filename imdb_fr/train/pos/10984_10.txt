A question that must be asked immediately is this: Was this film shot if the women it represented were not Jacqueline Lee's aunt and cousin Lee Bouvier Onassis? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not. <BR /> <br /> But fortunately they are (or were) Jackie's cousin and aunt. <br /> <br /> This documentary made by the Maysles brothers about the existence (we could hardly call it a life) of Edith B. Beale, Jr. and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie) have the same lure a train wreck: you do not want to watch but you have to do it. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly decomposing around them. The pretty gardens are now a jungle. <br /> <br /> A beautiful oil painting is leaning against the wall (with the cat's stool on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them as young women compete for space on the walls next to old magazine covers. <br /> <br /> Living alone together for many years has removed many barriers between the two women but has erected others. <br /> <br /> Apparel seems to be optional. Edie's favorite costume is shorts with a pantyhose and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says, "Edie is still beautiful at 56". And indeed she is. There are times when she is almost luminescent and where the two women show the beauty that was once. <br /> <br /> There is a constant current of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits are polite) strange. Ice cream spread on cookies. A dinner for Edith's birthday, consisting of Wonder Bread sandwiches, served in fine china with plastic utensils. <br /> <br /> Time is indifferent to them; like Edie says "I do not have a clock." <br /> <br /> Their relations with men are so strange. <br /> <br /> Edie has the impression that Edith has foiled all her happiness attempts. She says, "If you can not get a man to offer you, you might as well be dead." What Edith answers: "I'll take a dog in any day." <br /> <br /> It's obvious that Edith does not see her role in Edie's lack of camaraderie. At the beginning of the film, she said: "France has fallen but Edie no. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said.The two women speak at the same time and contradict each other constantly. <Br /> <br /> There is a strange relationship with the animals throughout the film: Edie feeds the raccoons from the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food Cats (and there are many) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> At one point, Edie declares that "the hallmark of the aristocracy is the responsibility." But they seem unable to take charge. <br /> <br /> > It's a difficult film to watch, but it's worth it.
