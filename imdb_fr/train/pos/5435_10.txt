I saw this picture in 1940 for the sum of 11 US dollars and I would like to buy a DVD in 2006. The film was the greatest adventure of the time and, like all epics, remains a marvel of entertainment ( N & B and others) The true bonds of friendship between the actors and the interpretations of Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Cianelli are exceptional "Untouchable" "You are a better man than me, Gunga Din" They do not make films of this character today. The only cast member alive today is Joan Fontaine.
