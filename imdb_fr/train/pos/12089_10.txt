<br /> <br /> Film dominated by raven-haired Barbara Steele, he was seen at the age of seven or eight and created permanent images of pale vampiric men and women chasing a castle , looking for blood. Steele is an icon of horror movies and a beauty from another world, and the sight of the undead is earlier than Romero's shamblers NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, unifying them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see the connection between this film and THE HAUNTING, who is intelligent but ambiguous about the forces present. DANZA MACABRE is an unpretentious film in which you dare to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. Claire Bloom, victim of an incredible overwork, has nothing like it. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, it is NOT necessary to redo this film. Not only is it a product of the '60s, but the high percentage of unskillful morons in Hollywood does not make it possible to understand MACABRE's terror formula. This formula is based on a determining factor: GOOD WRITTEN. Low-end classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a strong point of common writing. It's simple. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot in the cinematic mess of today. In addition, let Hollywood try original modifications and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past.
