Post-feminist representation of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! <br /> <br /> This underrated gem of a movie tells the story of Flavia, a 15th century girl born in a convent after defining her father and all of medieval Christian society by looking at a dead Islamic warrior. like a human figure rather than demonic. <br /> <br /> Incapable of accepting the patriarchal rule of the convent (explicitly stated in a scene where the bishop arrives accompanied by soldiers and monks), Flavia begins to question explicitly the society in which she is and, by confronting a whole system of subjugation, repression and violence, it inevitably leads to a tragic end not only for itself, but for all those around it. <br /> <br /> It is considered a piece of non-exploitation far from the truth. It is a film depicting the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I described it in the title of this piece as "post-feminist" and in the end, the triumphs of Flavia must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by men, even the macabre end of Flavia is perpetrated by men for men (the women turn away and only the monks look without horror. <br /> <br /> As for the much debated violence: this one is a description of the effects of violence and The horrors of a world driven by religious excesses would have avoided the impact of the film, lowered it and allowed it to fit into the patriarchal discourse it exposes. Realistic of the medieval society. <br /> <br /> Nicely filmed, played brilliantly (especially of Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), containing a superb score of Piovani and always stimulating after all these years, Flavia is a classic of the European cinema.
