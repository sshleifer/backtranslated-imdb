For me, the final scene, in which Harris responds to the press corps, is worthy of looking at this slice of intelligent and timeless politics (especially the campaign phase). If only "real life" politicians reacted in an intelligent and articulate manner, as Mr. Harris did, the egotistical selfish press members might think twice about surfacing with irrelevant "waste" and conflicting that have absolutely nothing to do. do with the abilities of candidates to effectively manage the challenges of the office for which he / she is pursuing.
