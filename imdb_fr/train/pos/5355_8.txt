Running Man jealously steals the American media complex today and touches his dead center. It may be an easy target, but they still succeed. RM is effortlessly engaged in pro-fight (with some professional wrestlers such as Hunters), network television, Nielsen hearings, the US government (suggesting it is entertainment-oriented), crime & punishment , and half a dozen other things along the way. This is far from Stephen King's original novel, and Arnold is not Ben Richard's novel either. But who cares? It is actually an Arnie film, with all the well-choreographed action sequences and lineages that such an enterprise requires.
