I found this film quite by accident, but I'm glad I did. Kenneth Branagh's performance nearly stole the film from Helena Bonham Carter, but their powerful chemistry made the movie much more enjoyable. This film is reminiscent of the excellent films that Branagh did with Emma Thompson. Carter's star as a disabled woman trying to complement herself was as good as the one I had seen for a long time in a woman's head. It's hard to describe a disabled person, but with her eyes essentially to show her pain about her situation in life, she made the thing so credible. If this film was released after the current wave of films with pretty women "defying" for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I am convinced that Carter would have had great consideration for an Oscar. If you meet this movie on the cable late at night, like me, believe me, it's worth it to sleep.
