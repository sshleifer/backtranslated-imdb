It's a British comic film that tears and I could watch again and again without getting tired. Peter Ustinov has never played in a bad role and this is no exception, especially with his arid mind but his very clever master plan. Karl Malden has always been one of my admirers since he played in Streets of San Francisco. But I think Maggie Smith is the real star of this movie, seeming so inept at everything she's trying to do, but in truth, she's so excited, especially at the end when she tells everyone that she has invested so much ar discovered by laundering his clothes. One thing worries me though. Could someone tell me why I can not buy this in DVD or VHS format in the UK, could anyone help, please?
