RKO studios have decided to borrow William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia, for one of their biggest budget efforts, to take advantage of The Thin Man's popularity. They have succeeded to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that in addition to Nick Charles and earlier than him, Bill Powell also played in a few Philo Vance films in the lead role. So at that moment, he was pretty well placed in the role. Dr. Bradford does not prepare as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles, but Nick's jaded basics are still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Dr. Bradford works to make a living as a doctor. This helped him in his detective profession and, in fact, in this film. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to solve. A jockey falls from a horse that enters the homestretch of a great race and dies for no apparent reason. The coach suspects something on foot, but is struck by the more conventional method of the ball. It was after his visit to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy exercised a more stable influence over Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays him more like a dizzy lady than Loy. But it works here and Powell and she have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> James Gleason, always reliable, is the police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. Asta and perhaps Eric Blore were the only ones who needed it, because Powell's butler was trying this part. <br /> <br /> If Powell and Arthur had signed in this studio, we might have seen a whole series of Bradford movies.
