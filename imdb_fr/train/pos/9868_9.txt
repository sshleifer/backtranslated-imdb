This is obviously intended for the same market as Monsters Inc. and Shrek, but is different in its less cartoon sense (despite the deliberately cartoony features of the lead creatures). The story is not the one that had a massive moral effect in the end (it's more like she was pulling on the sleeves of your shirt), but simply chose to tell a story about the relationships between different "animals" ". You know the result, but you can not help it. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are much more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors making voice), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. The group dynamic is brilliantly well presented and the revelations of characters and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. You will find yourself encouraging them much sooner than you would like. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant, as you can imagine, and you will pray to be able to go on the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and his desperate attempts to bury his fools. I went out looking for the obligatory goods, especially the lazy toy, to be disappointed the next day when I could not find anything vaguely related. <br /> <br /> Which, strangely, makes the film even more pure. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc. or Shrek.
