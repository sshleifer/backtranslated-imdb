Of course, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the movie will definitely change. The first time you see the movie, you see the underlying love story and you say: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks so), it's just a hassle and you sit and watch the movie thinking: when will this ship sink? And even that is not so impressive when you see it many times. The game in this movie is not bad, but certainly not great either. Was I happy that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for this movie? I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes a half-good movie and will not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there are almost no movies with him. But enough talk to me about the worst character in the movie. Kate Winslet's performance, on the other hand, was wonderful. I also think that the director is very good at editing a film of this magnitude. There is a lesson to be learned from this film: there are too many love stories as such, directors should not try to add a shabby romance to every movie !!! On 100%, I give only 71% to this film.
