Since I saw it in the theater, it's my favorite. Since then, I have seen it countless times and I do not get tired of it. The setting has a lot to do with that (Colorado, I know, would be jealous), but the script is original and I liked how it used the mountain folklore of small towns. There was no movie, I can compare that too. John Lithgow plays the role of a mean villain, but I love the fact that he's completely out of his element - he has to follow Tucker and that's what makes him interesting. It's an action movie at its best. I do not think I'll see another so entertaining. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 shots to be considered as an action movie. He must just keep you captivated, not shocked.
