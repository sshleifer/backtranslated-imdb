I remember this movie from years ago. Certainly the best movie on the subject of my experience. The fact that I remember the film so well after so long is a testament to its impact. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of performance because of the language barrier. But they were nevertheless very powerful. <br /> <br /> This subject continues to fascinate us over the years. And this has been treated more effectively here, with the appropriate proportion of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I wish this to be broadcast on television at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Where is it? Are some art film archives storing a copy?
