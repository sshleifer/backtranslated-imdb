Imagine what school would have been like in a world like this: children are a big group that has a great taste for music and unites against bad teachers and directors. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" takes place in this world. It's like a Ramones record coming to life. The characters are all as stupid, innocent and charming as the songs of the Ramones, and the music itself is, of course, fantastic. The comedies in high school have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" to that classic of the late '70s, where no tasteless sexual joke is made. As a remake is apparently in preparation, we can probably expect the charm of the original to be lost along the way and be replaced by vulgar and half-funny jokes, as Bill Hicks called them. However, the main problem will be that the Ramones CAN NOT be replaced. They were the perfect group for this movie and no one else could even take the place to take their place. So the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, as original and charming as it is. Gabba gabba hey!
