It's awesome! In Story mode, you go from punk to pro. You must achieve goals like skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and give him a name. You can make it stupid or realistic. You're with your friend Eric all the way through the game, until he betrays you and gets you fired from the skateboarding team (you can pick a team to be on) and you start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (which is not part of the story mode) of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create the pedestrian goal and write what he's talking about. If you are bored of doing so, you can achieve pre-set goals in pre-equipped parks. The only thing I did not like in this game is that sometimes it was difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
