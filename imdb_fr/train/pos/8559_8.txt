There is a certain genius behind this film. I laugh all the time. The scene in the sex phone office, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius / humor. The execution is mediocre, but you can see the message of the author and they have talent. The separation of Doppelganger at the end was like ... "ok, I did not really expect that, but let's see what the movie has to say." Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very consistent with the story in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Does the purpose of a movie make sense, or is it entertaining or communicating emotionally? Many movies bother me easily, but this one has always caught my attention. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have autobiographical roots, but it's just a guess. Horribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other movies that this person may have made (with more experience).
