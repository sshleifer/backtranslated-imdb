One winter day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-olds rent a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting", "who is this Jackie Chan?", "Never heard of him". Two hours later, after watching the movie, in the stunning, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and seriously behind the collection of JC! Films), The film always grabs me more than any other. Ok, maybe I have a thing for this movie because it was my first film (Cannonball Run does not count !!), but it's an excellent movie. It has all the classic elements of JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some reviews say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated! But then it's the same for Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Without movies like Police Story, where would Hollywood action be today? PS sets the standards, many scenes were stolen for use in other movies. To fully appreciate it, you have to see it on a widescreen. Otherwise, you miss the film so much (yes, it really falls off the bus that runs around the corner!). If you have not done so already, SEE THIS FILM NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
