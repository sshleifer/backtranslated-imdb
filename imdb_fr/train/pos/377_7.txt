Genteel, Steven Spielberg's drama was his first real adventure in this genre. Inspired by Alice Walder's novel and Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize, this film is about his 1993 success, "Schindler's List". The story concerns the arranged marriage of a struggling girl to a brutal and angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister, Nettie. While the intrigue - about compassion, abuse, and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its meaning through Menno Meyjes' break through continuity and heartbreaking storyline. . "The Color Purple" is sometimes difficult to follow and, on one or more occasions, tends to be a little erratic with regard to the calendar. This script error cost the viewer the depth and detail evident in Miss Walker's novel. It is a shame that Maestro Spielberg has been unable to identify and solve these problems, as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director. <br /> <br /> The performances are excellent, with Whoopi Goldberg making his first appearance - which has never been matched since when it comes to acting - as a broken heart, Celie aspiring to to be loved. Danny Glover brings strong support, although his "Moses" is a higher turn for him in "Places in the Heart". The excellent performance comes from Oprah Winfrey, unannounced, in the incarnation of Miss Sophia, this black woman with resolute fighting, whose mind is crushed by a terrible incident involving a white woman of the upper class, condescending. Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong also provided support. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote a beautifully melodic score and also provided original blues for the occasion. Michael Kahn's editing is good, as always, while the director of photography, Allen Daviau, is cleverly creative in capturing splendid landscapes of the South. <br /> <br /> This real case of heart will surely bring you a tear, unfortunately, we have so many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
