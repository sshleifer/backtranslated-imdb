It's an amazing movie. In addition to showing real images of key events in the failed coup attempt to chase Chavez, we also have the clutter that describes a society divided into classes. It seems that many rich people have the democratic choice among the people and want to use the army for regime change. "Pay attention to what you say before your servants" is a revealing comment. The head of the largest oil company in the country presents himself as the new president, with the support of the United States, and these young Irish directors have filmed everything. An excellent film to educate young people to democracy. We see transparent documentation of how the media can be manipulated and used forcefully, in the interests of big business, against the interests of the democratic will of the people. Riveting stuff.
