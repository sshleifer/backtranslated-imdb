I was impressed by the beautiful photography of this film, which was shot in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see many activities in which the Eskimos are involved, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, and so on. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are systematically present in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes archival footage because it was easy to recognize some rear-projection animal scenes, but even these were fascinating. Salmon spearfishing, walrus hunting, caribou hunting, even a polar bear and a whale have sometimes been reminiscent of a documentary. There was no casting list, which enhanced the flavor of the documentary. The filmmakers tried to make the film very authentic, the natives only speaking in an eskimo language translated by someone on screen or by intertitling. The introduction indicated that, with the exception of white traders and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, there were no actors in the film, but it was not strictly true. The two main characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and sometimes they could be seen doing makeup. But they were excellent in their roles and they continued their career in Hollywood. Overall, the film is worth the detour.
