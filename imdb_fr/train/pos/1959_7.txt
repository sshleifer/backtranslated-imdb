Let me be at the front, I like the dough. However, it's like one of those "easier dives" you see at the Olympics. It should be noted a little because it is easier to give a thrill than to train in the world of a painter of the late Middle Ages, for example. <br /> <br /> It's only two hours in a ghostly train and Although often (or more accurately, most of the time!) ridiculous and improbable, it always moves forward and always entertains. If not always the right way. Check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle. <br /> <br /> (However, we totally got why he was given a "worst film".) Razzie is disconcerting, I bet there were a thousand worst films made in 2006, but this film I had the treatment because it was considered a fashionable victim. <br /> <br /> The popular novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now finished in London writing a novel, but the death and the destruction follow her like a fly following a horse in hot weather. My God, she can not even go to the bathroom without falling into at least two corpses and I'm sure that if she opened the closet in her huge penthouse, it would come out in the Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, clearly a very dangerous lady (if you like your pulse to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean, why would anyone put two together and start thinking that she could be a murderer? Likewise, his reaction to such accusations seems very casual. However, is it simply a personality disorder (a form of the woman's risk addiction) or additional evidence of her guilt? <br /> <br /> For reasons that I do not understand or that I do not understand well, Stone is entrusted to psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation rather than taking cells as a result of a another "lover found dead in mysterious circumstances". Fortunately (for Stone), he is much crazier than any of his patients and has a difficult personal / professional life. In the blink of an eye, the relationship changes from doctor to patient and it is difficult to say what it is, because it becomes a kind of blur that turns. <br /> <br /> This intoxicating mix comes from Roy Washburn (a strange Welsh sounding David Thewlis) who tells the love struck the doctor - as a long-time policeman - that the woman in question can be dangerous . I mean, hold the first page. However, Glass now has too much glassy eyes to become aware of it or take care of it. Like a stunned boxer in front of Mike Tyson at prime time, he is ripe for big disassembly, but not before discovering that Washburn might have a secret or two himself. <br /> <br /> Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling), a psychiatrist colleague and a rare example (in this film) of someone who does not bark angrily or who is a murder suspect. Assuming that she actually watched the final film, she must look back nostalgically when her underwear came off with the ease of Stone - fortunately (for us at least) these days are over. Strangely, she does not think Stone is as dangerous as everyone else - otherwise, she does not think the script is good enough or that her check is big enough to allow for proper acting. <br /> <br /> After several laps The trail described above depicts a culminating blending representative of the province and "cliff", which, while as ridiculous as the rest of the film, leaves us with enough leeway for Basic Instinct 3 - very unlikely at this stage. on time.
