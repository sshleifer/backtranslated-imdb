Laurence Fishburne is an excellent actor and deserves the respect for having tried this, but he is not in a class with the great Shakespearians like Olivier and Welles; and he also suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irish, always brilliant, steals the show. Olivier recognized this potential in his production and associated Iago with a person he knew he could surpass. I had not almost realized the possibilities of Iago, the most perverse character of Shakespeare, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the views of Venice too.
