The second feature is about a London-based young woman who is desperate for a job and willingly accepts the job of a secretary with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people incarcerated in a house against their will always make me feel a bit uncomfortable - I end up feeling like a prisoner too - but this rather classy movie is neither terrifying nor claustrophobic. It's crazy and improbable, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. Rewrite this in 1986 (under the name "Dead Of Winter") proved to be unwise because the elements of the plot are not modern. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!), But she stays the course until the climax is too fast, which seems a little neglected. *** of ****
