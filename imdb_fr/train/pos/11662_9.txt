The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful and dazzling animated films I have ever seen. Before watching this film, I was sure nothing could make him lose money and that it was a win in this category, but I found Kells a serious competitor. <br /> <br /> Secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the abbot of Kell. The abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a little too strict and much more anxious to fortify the wall around the city after a next Viking attack than to feed the boy's imagination. When the legendary brother Aidan (who looks strangely like Willie Nelson) arrives and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a journey in the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph called Aisling, who loves him (and saves his life more than one time). With the help of Aisling, he tries to save the city and helps Brother Aidan to complete the mystical book that, according to legend, can turn darkness into light. <br /> <br /> See my complete account of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
