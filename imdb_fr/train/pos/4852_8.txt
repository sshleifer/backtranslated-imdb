It's now one of Big's best, Jack Hulbert's unique role in 1931 being split in two for Band Waggon's radio crew, Askey & Murdoch. It has an excellent distribution, which has everything to please, especially Askey. Linden Travers, melodramatic, Herbert Lomas and pragmatic, Richard Murdoch, assured the histrionic. <br /> <br /> The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely train station overnight found more than they had planned, ghostly trains, spectral carriers, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all . His repartee with everyone is between the lateral cleavage and the dreadful boredom. When the formula works, it's fine, but sometimes it becomes very artificial and makes you feel like the movie is more dated than it really is. But those cursed fifth perfidious chroniclers - thank God, God does not have one yet! <br /> <br /> In the end, a good, harmless movie, which will be seen on television as an old friend, but if you expected to be thrilled by your wood, you will probably be very disappointed!
