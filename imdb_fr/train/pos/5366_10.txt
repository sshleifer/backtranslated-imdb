I am sitting here in November 2006 and I still can not help but talk enthusiastically about this film. Arnold's best films were made about 4 or 5 years ago. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are incredible. Arnold's lame liners in this movie will make you laugh more than once. I find the acting in this film surprisingly good, as was the case in Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job trying to make the futuristic scenes, as is supposed to happen in 2017, but you can not help but snicker when the 80s style hairstyles of men and women in the crowd and the normal TV screens from The Running Man studio, which we all know here in 2006, is disappearing with the emergence of flat screens and HDTVs. In addition, the images of the intro of the game show "The Running Man" would not look like those of 2017. Nevertheless, the scenario is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this film did I want to get up and not worry about the end, which I often do with today's movie. I really think Arnold's role is much better than he deserves. Now I would not have elected Governor but it's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I find that the producers do not try to overload the fight scenes. When the stalker is dead ... he is dead. It does not last 20 minutes each. Stalking scenes are fast and fun, but they do not try to exaggerate them. I give this movie a 10/10 and it comes from someone who does not like a lot of movies these days. If you have the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic displays you'll see in 2006 are neither important nor necessary.
