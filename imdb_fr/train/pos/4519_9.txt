Julie Waters is remarkable and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very warm, very real and extremely entertaining look at the complications of gender dysphoria and transvestism in the life of a young executive. At the heart of this film is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope others will accept you.
