George Cukor directs a dark and cynical classic. The distinctive Ronald Coleman is at its best in this piece of Black about an actor who gets lost in his roles. Critically acclaimed Anthony John (Colman) chased his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) from his highly fueled temperament and erratic behavior. But both manage to continue working together to please their audience. Things are beginning to change as John begins to miss his career. he reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He becomes deeply a jealous and murderous man. He begins to walk between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and ends up killing his mistress (Shelley Winters), but has no memory of this despicable act. <br /> <br /> Colman seems irreproachable in this role. Winters is very impressive because the young woman decided to move away from her sordid life. Also in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
