I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before seeing this miniseries. I had read and watched many classics before, and I thought most of the classics were boring, overexpressed and overrated, with at best moderately interesting intrigues. This mini-series of Jane Eyre has completely changed my designs. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress and she beautifully describes Jane Eyre. Her accent is charming and her calm and firm nature perfectly matches the character of the young housekeeper. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the film make me believe that he was born to play the monstrous master of Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep at night after watching this miniseries. The plot is both haunting and inspiring. The characters are masterfully interpreted and the story is amazing. It's the best version of Jane Eyre so far in a movie. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how close this miniseries was to Charolette Bronte's writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, watch the 1983 version of Jane Eyre from the BBC.
