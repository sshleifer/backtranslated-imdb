Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they fall in love with their neighbor Court (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can separate them and that their love for each other never fades. <br /> <br /> It was really a heartbreaking story about first love. Probably the most painful story about the young love I have ever seen. All the actors are incredible and Reese Witherspoon gives an excellent performance in her first film. I would give the man in the moon 8.5 / 10
