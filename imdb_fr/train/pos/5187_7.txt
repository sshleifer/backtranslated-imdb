This series corresponded exactly to what you expect from Mr Spielberg. It's really one of those scary, funny and childish shows you'll never forget. Like Outer Limits, this small series does what few people can do. It was great and deserved to run longer. It was an excellent show that even kids could watch, even though some shows were a bit scary when they wanted to, but they all still had a morality at the end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you understand what situation you were not did not want to find you, or those you did. I remember watching some of these sci-fi movies at the age of 10 and even now, I always like to see them when I can. Really a funny and imaginative show. I loved it and I still love it.
