If you want to remember MJ, it's a good place to start. This film features beautiful melodies, MJ as a robot, and a crazy and messy plot. I remember that, many nights, I went to this beautiful film in college and I thought about the wonders of anyone who decided to give the green light to this ridiculous work. <br /> <br /> There are many songs. A lot of dance. There are many songs while dancing. MJ kills him as you would expect when it comes to these kinds of things. But there is a lot more to this film. There is clay. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic bunny that Michael Jackson has to fight in a dance (obviously also in clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not in clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - we love you Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
