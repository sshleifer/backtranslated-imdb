"Once in the life" is a very good movie. However, this is not good for everyone, because of the intensive use of vulgar language and the violence of certain situations. The film manages to represent in an anecdotal and credible way the "life" in the neighborhoods of New York where drug problems are important. This representation is in turn used as a set for a very thoughtful and moving drama, supported by powerful dialogues (however, I had a hard time understanding some of them because English is not my mother tongue OK for the videos). There is sometimes a bit of excessive gambling, but I think it fits quite well with Fishburne's general orientation to the film, which gives food for thought more than just a style exercise, especially in time management. and action. The characters, even if they are not simple, are easy to understand and the actors are doing well to imitate them. By the way, I really enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you are not too prudish, you should like to see this movie once, twice, three times. I noticed the movie 9/10.
