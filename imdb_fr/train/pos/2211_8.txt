I do not watch much TV, except for The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! 'S Soup. I think I hold this show in good company. <br /> <br /> I like the scathing criticism of pop culture that this show gives. Soup also allows me to stay above what people in the office refer to when talking about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (esp.). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Soup displays excerpts from the highlights of these events. the broadcasts, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (go, most people are hooked on watching American Idol because of the monster show that are the auditions), which is why most people claim to watch. And that means I do not have to suffer the other 98% of these scary talk shows or "reality shows" for a "funny" or "shock" nugget. The only reason Soup does not get a 10 in my opinion is that sometimes the sketches are not so fun and, even in rarer cases, the reviews are not always up to par. <br /> <br /> Joel's quick wit and his team of writers (including McHale) make it a great show. It is my pleasure to enjoy the laughs and comments of the team members who are out of camera. Even when they are obviously obvious laughing from time to time as a courtesy, it's hilarious because it's forced. They are obviously ironic. And that's part of what makes this show funny.
