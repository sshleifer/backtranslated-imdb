(ATTENTION: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this one midway and I looked from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was . This certainly caught my attention; I did not know until the end that it was based on a true story! The guy she used to commit looks dirty came out and looks like a really nice guy who just got his head twisted by a sneaky girl; I have to wonder how faithful this representation is to life. Anyone who would like to murder a husband and wife while they slept can not be quite nice. I still had some sympathy for him because he had been created and exploited; this has been clarified. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is the end (here is the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn it). A few minutes before the end, it seemed impossible to discover the truth. The way this was discovered was an "undercover operation", but my question is, how did the police feel they were accepting him? The film did not show us that, and it seemed a bit too convenient in the absence of an explanation of how they were persuaded to do it. <br /> <br /> I think the way they handled this was done for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the explanation gave an impression of suspense to the crucial scene that otherwise would not would not have been (we already knew what the scene was and what was happening with Brad). <br /> Otherwise, it's a very good movie; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now, I am interested in discovering the facts of the real case. <br /> <br /> One last thing: the film was shot in 1996. Some of the critics here seem to treat it as a newer movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is charming. I had not seen it before. She can also act a little (always an asset in her work, LOL).
