Wow, I have not seen this movie for the last time for years. The look in 2008 is certainly different from that of 1986. At first, I did not think I could go through the film. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so obnoxious, arrogant and disrespectful that I had a hard time observing him. He embodied all the negative stereotypes of Americans. If that was not enough, once the best workers in the small American town were shown, the picture was getting worse. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese were portrayed as robotic and unemotional workaholics. The film was not even so funny, I only stayed there for its nostalgic value. And I'm happy to have continued the watch. <br /> <br /> Just like with boxing, judges are influenced by the way you finish the round. This film went from about three to seven, which I noticed because of the end. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious end and that's exactly it. It was great that the city could keep its jobs and factory, but the most special was the marriage of Japanese customs and values ​​with American customs and values. It was a mediocre film that ended on a positive note.
