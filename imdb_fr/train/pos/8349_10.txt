The most famous film of Depardieu is this pioneer (1974) of Bertrand Blier. It presents many scenes very sexual grazing an X-rating, including one of Jeanne Moreau doing a hot version of the 1970s of his Jules and Jim household three with the two French hairy hippies (Depardieu and Deware). There is no sacred territory in this film; everything is beautiful game. <br /> <br /> It is very strange that the Americans do not really like this film, whereas many French people I met consider it a classic. Something about this goes against what the Americans have been programmed to "love". <br /> <br /> Gerard and the late Patrick Deware are two hippie buffs who slap and quibble, with many sexual insecurities, harassing women and committing minor crimes. . They are offside and anti-capitalist, "euro-commie" and "lazy". Blier satirizes both of these types while at the same time making bourgeois society itself much more ridiculous. But the best of all is how Stephane Grappelli's wonderful score conveys the restless soul of the dinghies, the deeper subconscious consciousness or "superior ideal" that motivates all the follies in which they engage.
