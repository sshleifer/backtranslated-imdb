When I first watched this film, it was a recorded copy and the title was Caged Terror. I still have the tape and I admit that I have watched more than once from beginning to end! The film has an extremely low budget and the dialogue is often fun without wanting it! I had some of my friends watching this and we laughed a lot about the terrible scenario. The movie is about a couple (remember it dates back to the early 70's, so they're just too hip!) Who go camping on weekends in what I thought was in northern New York York. They have a hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl laments the death of the fish and ate it! The guy comes back with something mocking about how they ate the fish and now he was part of it, and he's leaving; "And he is a magnificent man!" Heavy man, really heavy! LOL! Anyway, here are some veterans from Vietnam, including one who plays the flute, I believe. (In any case, they are musical comrades!) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple turns out to be unfriendly, they end up terrorizing them during the night. The guy ends up in a chicken coop and has to watch his girlfriend get ravished by both guys. In fact, at the end of the night, she seems to be pretty and when the morning arrives, the guys leave and the girl and the guy are free to leave. Supposedly, the guy has learned a lesson on how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh! Anyway, it never fails to have fun! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old copy on tape, I would buy it in fact, it's a classic camp! You must love that kind of thing!
