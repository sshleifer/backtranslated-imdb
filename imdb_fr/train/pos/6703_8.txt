My kids have recently started watching this show - the first episodes of the N series, and the latest on ABC Family - and they love it. (I did not know that the series had already spent the first or second season) I'm curious to know what motivated all the casting changes - I saw them described as "high-profile", yet half an hour research efforts on the web have revealed only endless comments on how the first episodes were so much better than the last ones. (Personally, I do not see much difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same - but they lose great people along the way) My daughter put the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe that Earth's special features and comments will shed some light on all of this. I would also like them to have a little self-reference humor about the changes - like in "Boy Meets World" where they drop the little sister for about a season, and when a different actor shows up more they ask her where she was and where she says "upstairs" or when the first geek series "Minkus" show up at the end of high school, they ask him where he went and he says "over there", showing the part of the class never shown near the camera, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and get out of the screen (Mr. Turner being another character who's gone) Oh well - maybe there'll be a real Hollywood story about this or something? I was just happy to see Aunt Hilda show up for the final - she's always been one of my favorites - it's a pity that it was not a more complete distribution meeting. (The Zelda candle just did not cut me)
