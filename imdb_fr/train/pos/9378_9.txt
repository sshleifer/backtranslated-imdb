Dahl seems to have been under the influence of The American Friend of Wenders. Innocent Nick Cage is recruited for a shot. Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero becomes more and more embarrassed as he tries to break free. And the small cities of America do not seem so safe as the big city. Like its predecessor mentioned above, this film has many twists that seem unlikely, but all of which lead to cathartic self-discovery.
