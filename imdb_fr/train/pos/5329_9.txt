This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was absurd. <br /> <br /> The action sequences were invented. <br /> <br /> But, if you lighten enough to laugh, it was an exciting adventure combining Keystone Cops and Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The bad guys were more stupid than bad. The good ones were not too good. Black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of a baby has added a nice touch. Sympathy could have been a bit difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree on the acting game. It was overall very good. I really wanted to hit Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> And, after all, is not it the mark of a very good film that wants to hit Judge Reinhold?
