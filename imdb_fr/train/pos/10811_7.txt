This film takes you to another era where the rhythm of everyday life was different. We have an idea of ​​how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men to fight. A very touching look at the past and a reminder that war losses do not just happen at the front. Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents went through during a war. I think this film is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks surprisingly like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as possible. It's really worth listening to him reciting "High Flight" and making me wonder what he could do with Shakespeare.
