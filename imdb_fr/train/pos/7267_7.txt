Curly Sue is a 6 year old girl with an abundance of hair and a vagrant life. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the street by becoming crooks. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive parking garage, while Curly screams about the pursuit and the pull offered to the victim. This is a very high-end lawyer, Gray (Kelly Lynch), who is shocked at what she did. Not only do the scammers earn a little money, but they also spend the night in Gray's sumptuous apartment. Even then, Gray feels she owes them more, so they stay together for a moment. Gray knows only the lucrative business of law and nothing of life. Who better to teach him than Bill and Curly, these experts aware of the realities of life? But all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a lawyer and a hustler. Where is he? It's a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple, but much sharper, of course. Belushi gives a rare touching performance because of his luck and Lynch is as bright as a pretentious but soft-touch lawyer. John Hughes, as a writer and director, shows us once again his magical touch, because the script is alive and unpredictable. Just watch Curly and Bill take Gray for a no-money party and see the fun results. Do you want happy, long-promised and finally delivered ends, with some uncertain moments in between? This is your custom film.
