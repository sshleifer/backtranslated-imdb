I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, poignant, moving and entertaining. A movie like this would do very well with word of mouth reviews. I would certainly tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Let's just hope they have the chance. I would say that this movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It does not contain violence, action scenes, murders, sex. It is obvious that distributors are wondering whether to pick it up or not. Believe me, there are people who would like to see a film like this that has a reductive value, instead of the many typical blockbusters that are usually offered to us.
