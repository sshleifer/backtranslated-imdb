I really enjoyed this film. The way Deanna and Alicia became friends after such a tragedy really intrigued me. Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy to see someone after being shot. The only complaint I would make is that at first it was a bit slow and it took a while to get to the base. Other than that, he was great.
