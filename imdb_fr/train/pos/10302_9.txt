This film is Jim Carrey's best film. Carrey did not have her usual face in this movie. He was both funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for all that is wrong in his life. Then God comes down from heaven and gives his powers to Bruce. As I said before, Carrey did a great job. I also thought that Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were excellent as an actor / actress supporter. The plot was good because there were a lot of sub-points in the main point. This movie can be funny (Bruce's dog) or sad (the "break"). The script worked well too. I'm glad they made a follow up to this movie. I note this film a 9/10.
