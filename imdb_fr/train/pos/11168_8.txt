Based on the real exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in the 1890s in New York, "The Bowery" has a lot of energy and is in a good mood. <br /> <br /> But be warned: casual racial epithets spring from the language of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper. The very first shot can be surprising. This is true for the moment it was defined and the moment it was made. And it also reflects the diversity of the population in this corner of the country. This certainly adds to the hectic flavor of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beery as Connors is the overwhelming thunder in the center of the action, a strong-mouthed lounge guard with his own fire brigade. And he has a weakness for the orphan Cooper. Raft as Brodie is the most elegant and stylish rival of Connors in almost every business. Brodie could never refuse a challenge and love the attention, leading to a jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (one always wonders if he actually jumped or if he used a mannequin). <br /> <br /> Beery is as bright as ever an Irish American accent. He is just the kind of gruff character who draws children, cats and ladies in distress. This is probably the most turbulent character ever played by Raft, and he even manages to get involved with a little dance (as well as a demonstration of legs). And again, he confuses the head lady (the beautiful Fay Wray) with a prostitute. Cooper is as tough as any of them, though he has a chance to cry. <br /> <br /> The climax is not the jump of the bridge but a fist fight without taboo between Connors and Brodie. it looks like a real fight between the principal ones. Surely someone has bruised more than an ego.
