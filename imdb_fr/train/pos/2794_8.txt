How can a film be both controversial and sweet? This one does it with an almost perfect structure. Nobody wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently, most cultures do not want their daughters to have small breasts either. Here we see a group of awesome actors we've never heard of before, portraying people from different cultures who lead a mundane life until their daughters wish and become capable of becoming professional footballers. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is magnificent. There is no condescension. Both cultures are considered modern and valid. (And yes, both are stupid, too). A flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of parents but not a child among them.
