I loved it, being a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the story would be - it did not fail to delight me. I also like the fact that, apart from Eric Stoltz, I did not recognize a person - it's refreshing, a bit like BSG. This has allowed me to discover a host of new talent - I can not wait for the series to start airing. Congratulations to Ronald D. Moore and his team - great job. Special effects, dialogue and acting were on the agenda and I felt emotionally caught in the script. I know some purists will probably not agree with my assessment, but I felt Caprica was far superior to most science fiction products produced in the last decade.
