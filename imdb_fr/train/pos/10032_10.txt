I love this movie since the age of 7 and I saw it the day of the opening. It was so touching and beautiful. I highly recommend seeing for everyone. It's a movie to watch from afar with your family. <br /> <br /> MPAA ranking: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disaster, nudity / sexuality and a bit of language.
