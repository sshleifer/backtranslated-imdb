My 3rd grade French lessons have always been very popular with this film. In a multicultural high school downtown, the film had many topics for discussion (in French in class, but I know that a lot of discussions took place in English after classes). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to that between Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I always said that I felt that this movie had one of the most "sexy" scenes I've ever seen in a movie. . One year, a 17-year-old African-American shouted, "Yes!" when he understood the scene: the one where Protée helps Aimee put on her evening gown, while examining the reflection of the other in the mirror. The filmmakers use the "mirror technique" when they then want to focus on the internal conflict of one or more characters in a scene: it is a perfect example of technique and is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film. One of them suggested that one of the themes of the film was "Africanism" and that no matter how much we loved Africa or Africans, we could not "become" African (as the driver had tried to do it): you had to be African.
