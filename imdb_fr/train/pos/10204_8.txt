Even though it's not the best anime I've ever seen, but I enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read the comic, I just saw it in the video store and I decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was correct, I had the impression of the 80's cartoon and that's what made me understand. Why everyone hates what's beyond me. <br /> <br /> The development of the character was going well. I love the way they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death. for you who do not like it, obviously did not pay attention. Lucifer explains how that works and she uses her words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a nice mentor / soldier for her. his noisy dark style was perfect for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I think everyone here who has criticized this must look at it again and reconsider it. because all that people have criticized this can be said about everyone's favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
