Since I am a true product of the hip-hop and electronic music generation, this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, although not as "authentic" in some respects as Wild Style, is a film that guarantees the souls of all those who are proud of the culture of urban samples / DJ-based music and electro clubs. . <br /> <br /> Although I recognize that sometimes the dialogue is a bit cheesy, you can not help but feel the characters and, in the end, "would you like to be there" for the beginning of the hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The Roxy disco club's b-boy fight scene (a real competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers) is just as essential for a hip-hop fan's archive as it is for any classic album. Observe if possible some of the movements of the idle breakers to truly appreciate the sporting and stylistic know-how of a seasoned B-boy / B-girl. All the praises to the Zulu nation !!!
