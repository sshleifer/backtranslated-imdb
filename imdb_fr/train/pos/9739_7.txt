I had fun watching this movie, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid box office success for humorous films. <br /> <br /> He is hired for his job in the London building in London by New York media giant Jeff Bridges as a writer for one of his celebrity wipes. <br /> <br /> After paying off his debt, he enters the upper echelons of fame by writing on the hackdom (the "seventh room"), where he happens to be a minor celebrity himself. The story is very entertaining and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive supporting role as a hard-working publicity agent. <br /> <br /> Along the way to success, he discovers the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> Outside the stereotypical plot, the movie was very entertaining, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as love. The rest of the cast did its job well. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy that was well worth going to the theater.
