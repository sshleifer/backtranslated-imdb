We can say that it is a very good "sequel", better than that of the first live action movie 101 Dalmatians. He has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all good burlesque! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has had a fairly important treatment, is now a dog lover and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella tried to kill, do not believe it. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (2nd chance shelter owner), believe she has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick and his companion gave birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... <br /> <br /> With Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close in Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu in Le Pelt, it's a good family movie with a lot of excitement and a lot more! One of the weaknesses of this movie is that it has a lot of painful slapstick, but not as excessive as the last movie. It's also funnier than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
