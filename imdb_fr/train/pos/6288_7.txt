GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, stylish and stylish action movie with high star power and many superb automobiles. . If you're a spectator interested in cars, this production by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock") is worth the detour, just to feast your eyes on brilliant vehicles. Although the film has a scent of weakness in many areas, its sense of action and enthusiasm make it an exciting success for the summer. <br /> <br /> The film stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as the young crook named Kip Raines, who, at the opening of the film, fails to deliver a long list of luxury cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened for this reason, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skilled car thief, is called upon to carry out a task in return for his brother's survival. : steel fifty cars specified by model, color, year and preparation only four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis spends the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him complete the flight. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy and well-known retired rogue from Memphis, a colleague by the name of Mirror Man (TJ Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), as well as that Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> A secondary plot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect the previous experience that Memphis and his team are not there, contributes to the motivation of the film. good and watch them more closely. <br /> <br /> Here, there is not much time for character development; the public gets to know these people through their difficult lifestyles and assumes difficult personalities through the film, an elegant atmosphere. To make matters worse for the movie, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a harsh cultural tone. I do not say that I think that blasphemy and vulgarism are necessary for the development of thrillers; In fact, I pay tribute to the director's decision to maintain foul language in a film that could very easily have earned an R-rating. However, I believe in a movie such as "60-second parties," to strongly develop the character's enlightenment, the dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective because of the irreproachable quality, perfectly responsible interpreters. The melodramatic performance of Nicolas Cage is intense and convincing. The shabby appearance of Angelina Jolie is quite appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously robust and credible. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide compelling support roles. <br /> <br /> The film presents a standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that specifies the style of the story and the motives of the character, sets up a fast paced action theme, but lacks depth and of strong character introduction. In the second act, we still encounter some problems: history loses time during most of this segment, but it never really extends to the third act. While the middle of the film takes a lot of time and a sex scene provides a solid plot, not much happens. The third act is a rush of adrenaline, a furious emotion from one wall to another and one of the most intense car chases ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of "Gone in 60 Seconds" helps deal with inspiring action scenes. These are scenes like car chases that make this movie work despite several destructive mistakes. Dominic Sena, whose career has been mainly in commercials, has an attractive style and a decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds", which will offer the public two hours of excitement, thrills and thrills, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
