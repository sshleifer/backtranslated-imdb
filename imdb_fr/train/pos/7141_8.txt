Since the death of Siskel and the absence of Ebert, the show is left in the hands of Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a film critic, he simply criticizes everything he does not personally like, that is, movies with country music are scanned because "I do not like country music!" and children's movies have a standard "Do not see it now, wait for it on DVD and rent it for your children!" Roeper might be a silly scholar, but in another field. The weekly guests sitting for Ebert are doing better, but who wants to pick a daisy in the middle of a cow? That said, it's the only show in town and that's the only reason it's worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, you can too! We are waiting for your mind and your thoughts. Do what is necessary to get this usurper out of his self-appointed throne.
