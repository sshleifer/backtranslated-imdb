<br /> <br /> In 1970, after an absence of five years, Kurosawa made his first color film. Ka-Den's film Dodes is centered on many stories that intermingle and unfold in a small slum of Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the sound that a mentally disabled boy makes by imagining that he is directing a train. . We are gradually acquainted with more people from the small community, the two drunks who exchange women because they are not happy with the women they have. The old man who is the center of the city helping a burglar trying to steal him. The very poor father and son who can never afford a house, imagine a house of their own. At the end of the film, all the stories are closed, some become happy, others sad. <br /> <br /> Since this is Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he uses it to his advantage and it shows. May be too much. This film goes in many different directions and it is difficult to move in and get started. But do not get me wrong, the Ka-Den of Dodes is perhaps not the best of Kurosawa, but, coming from the greatest director of all time, it's a lot better than 99% of today's movies hui.
