This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most faithful to Bronte's work. Dalton is a bit hard to imagine as Rochester that Jane Eyre said "not beautiful". But her role is better and Zelah Clark, as pretty as she is, is also a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch but worth it. The script contains almost direct quotes from the book and if you want the very first real "romance" in the literature, here's the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. Filming may seem a little old-fashioned now, but there will never be.
