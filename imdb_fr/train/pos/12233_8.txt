Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them fly through the rings of Saturn. His comrades are killed instantly, but they seem to be the luckiest. Steve returns to Earth a mass of humanoid pulp that constantly oozes. as he turns into a savage assassin and he melts at every step, he is followed by his friend, Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). <br /> <br /> It's often so funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that I find it hard to believe that the laughs are all involuntary. This seems to me to be a kind of nonsense for the low-budget genre endeavors of the '50s and' 60s, and as such, it's a wonderfully entertaining film. This sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We even face a split-screen sequence that adds nothing but remains a gas to watch. <br /> <br /> The writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for proposing this ingenious idea; its ultra-viscous nature is truly memorable. I think his pace is a little behind; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) last a bit longer, but in the end, it delivers solid and schlocky products with some panache. The highlight is particularly fun. <br /> <br /> Arlon Obers 'music is pleasantly shaky (but ridiculously ridiculous at times), and Willy Curtis' cinematography sometimes creates great shots. This brings me to the fantastic and compelling makeup effects of Rick Bakers, which is a very respectable centerpiece of the film, right up to the ultimate final fusion. <br /> <br /> Rebar is under heavy makeup for almost the entire film (Sachs also congratulates me for making the film) and does what he has to do well. DeBenning is a rather idiotic and stupid hero. Ann Sweeney is not as attractive as his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson agree. It's also worth seeing artists like Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (making an appreciable head shot), Janus Blythe (of "Eaten Alive" by Tobe Hoopers and "The Hills Have Eyes" by Wes Cravens), and even the director Jonathan Demme in a little bit. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining midnight movie with enough gore, chills and laughter to rate it as interesting to remember for sci-fi and low-level horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
