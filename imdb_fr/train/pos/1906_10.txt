Unfortunately, 8 Simple Rules, for dating my teenage daughter, was the last sitcom John Ritter worked on after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors of all time. He had it all, comedy (which can be forgotten in Three's Company), but he was also an excellent drama actor (Unforgivable, which is worth watching a TV movie). I loved all the other members of the cast (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was THE star, it was largely the reason why I was attracted to the show in the first place, and it was was his perfect comedy performance that managed to make me crack every time. <br /> <br /> I loved the fact that the show is not quite sweet (just like I loved the Cosby Show, come on, they were too nice to each other lol) they brilliantly described the typical family dynamics. It was pretty realistic with all the sibling rivalries and parent arguments, but they still kept it funny. Many American sitcoms try to complete the series entirely of morality, among other things, and this series did not do it. Yes, there were some, like drugs and harassment, that dealt with important issues, but they did not want to be a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they wrote John's death show was brilliantly done, I still sob like a baby every time I see him. You could feel how much the emotions were believed during these incredibly hard episodes. <br /> <br /> I'm sad that the series was canceled, I still like to watch reruns and I do not get tired. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, we will always remember you for the hilarious description of this overly protective father, who prefers to lock up his girls in their room than to bring them out with a boy =) You rock Ritter !! !
