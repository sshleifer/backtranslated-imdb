The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story to do with The Lion King. It basically follows the original story of the Lion King but with some twists and turns. In the film, the events are explained by a different point of view. This story is still an original plot. <br /> <br /> As for the suites, Disney is not very good at making them worthy of interest. This, being the third part of the Lion King (the second pride of Simba), has in fact an original idea while keeping the pleasure of the first part. Timon and Pumbaa travel in search of the ideal place to live. After searching far, they find the place of "Hakuna Matata". They then meet a little lion named Simba and discuss many things that parents are experiencing today. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great movie and I'm happy to add it to my collection.
