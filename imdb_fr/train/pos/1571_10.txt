Since Spongebob Squarepants, I have not seen a bigger cartoon on TV. The colors are beautiful, the voices could not be better, the characters are so original, a great cartoon. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this caricature. I hope the DVD of the season will be released soon !!! I love cartoons like this one and I hope more people will turn to this great cartoon. It is very difficult to find the DVD of the season. If someone finds a store that sells it, let me know. The only Catscratch merchandise available on Nick Shop is a great lookin shirt, but very very very expensive !!! If you like SpongeBob, who does not? you will also love Catscratch!
