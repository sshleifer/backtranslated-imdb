Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars that year. She is hilarious. Of course, there was a serious serious side to the series. She was great not only because she's funny, but also because she said some things that had to be said in a public forum. Whites must be reminded that the ceremonies, employment, and price representation in Hollywood are racially imbalanced. There should be no need for "black" shows. Candidates and judges of white bread, milquetoast have to stand up in the sun and realize that the quality of the films is not limited to directors, producers, actors, etc. "White". He had no business being there. In fact, this is the first Oscar presentation I've seen since "The Color Purple" was awarded. This voting error prevented me from watching the shows until 2002. This should not denigrate the other presenters. Billy Crystal is a riot.
