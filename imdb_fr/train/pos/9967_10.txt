There are things I will never understand; why underwear comes in packs of three while, obviously, that's not enough, it's an example. Likewise, I will never understand this movie, and it's great. If you approach this film while waiting for a real movie, you might as well approach Satan while waiting for a hug; although this may be possible if you greet the satanic figures of this film. Take Pitch for example; the most ineffective representation of the camp, a hell, the devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a five-meter-tall satan suit made of red body paint and condom-coated horns. However, this creates some of the most hilarious moments of all movies. Seriously, that's not an understatement. The same thing can apply to all other characters, except for the little girl who behaves with such an unhealthy innocence that she probably overcompensates for a serious crime of which she is a part. Once again, if the Santa Cluster Space Station is real, she would have no chance of avoiding it for so long. In simple terms, if you have not seen this movie, you can not consider yourself a great lover. The characterization, the acting, the concept and the racism almost under the radar, which are funny fun, make it a must-see above any movie to date (if you're looking for a real laugh.).
