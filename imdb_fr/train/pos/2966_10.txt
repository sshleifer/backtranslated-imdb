BASEketball is great! It's hilarious and so funny that you wet your pants with a laugh. I have seen it so many times that I stopped counting. But every time, it gets funny. <br /> <br /> Believe me on that one ... BASEketball is a resounding success and I loved it and will continue to love it. I hope that one day a special edition DVD will come out !!! <br /> <br /> Ten inches in the air !!!
