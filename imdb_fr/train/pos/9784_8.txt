Sensitive films lack shine and, to some extent, narrative structure, but are nevertheless beautifully shot and interpreted. However, the point of the narrative structure is debatable. Although this gives the impression of giving free rein to reality in the final scenes and linking his thoughts to what the modern observer might describe as a "story," I am skeptical as to whether this feeling * needs * a "structure narrative" that is defined and detectable. Inevitably, he will be compared to SOMERSAULT in that his central protagonist (I'm not sure that's the correct word!) Is a young and very young woman, whose newly discovered sexuality confuses her and gives her power - of course Cate Shortland's film deals better with this aspect. But if it is possible for reckless spectators to qualify this film as a clich√©, PEACHES is, in some respects, much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. Maybe that's where it does not quite fit. It's certainly very different from Monahan's first feature film - THE INTERVIEW! I'm not sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added to the story. Who knows - maybe they did it. They certainly drew attention to the compromised and imperfect nature of Weaving's character - though I personally think it was done without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** JUSA SEEN AGAIN THE FILM ***** **** <br /> <br /> During a second viewing, I can see how some the would dismiss as a television movie dressed as a feature. But I'm not sure how distinct these "categories" are, or whether we should make that distinction. In any case, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. Moreover, the structure of the film is very formal and its content does not pose a problem, at least as SOMERSAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, THE FAMILY DOCTOR ILLUSTRATED, CHOOSE YOU AND THE HUMAN TOUCH. The performances are all good, but I realized that the main reason I liked the movie was its adaptation to the "Australian" genre, without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that it could be a good enough reason for another person * NOT * to like that! Indeed, it is only when Lung entered the room, dressed in her Vietnamese dress, that the film really began to give punch. But that brings us to another debate - * should we * expect a film to challenge us all the time? Certainly, I like to be challenged by a movie (or a book, or by other people), but is there no more room for what is simply a beautiful story? <br /> <br /> I did not delete my initial message about it. film, because I am too aware of the Orwellian nuances of such an act. But I would reduce my initial score from 8 to maybe 6.5. <br /> <br /> Regarding the nominations for AFI Best Film, my votes go to THE HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WONS - and I think LOOK TWO WAYS should win.
