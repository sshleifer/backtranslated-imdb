I saw two movies over the weekend, one was "kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both films are made in "Bollywood" but they are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw has left its indelible mark with "Ankhen", one of the best Hindi comedy films. His casting of Charters is perfect. The story apparently taken from a game of Gujerati is great, the treatment is superb with a few exceptions. In Bollywood, when a film is shot, the first thing a Bollywood director is inclined to do is to recruit a music director and this guy (Malik mediocre in this case) is forced to compose six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease Finacier and Grandma who just can not get enough of those numbers. No music director can produce good songs relentlessly, as this film clearly shows. None of the songs have a melody and they are clearly intrusive in the narrative of the story with the exception of the background music and the westernized version of Bharat-Natyam. The duel and the role play between father and son are good for Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His waterfall scenes are clearly remarkable. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is ready to wait for a good story to appear, as in this super movie. Then we have an insipid, classless producer, like Sharukh Khan, who will strive to shamelessly connect and promote junk like "Kaal" in order to enrich himself at the cost of improving art, and they surround themselves with a limit talent, and they recover the investment before the word circulates. It is Bollywood grasshoppers who attack unsuspected audiences to win Bollywood Chamcha's "Film Farce" awards, most of which are in the media.
