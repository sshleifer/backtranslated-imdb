Certainly one of the least of the musicals Astaire / Rogers. It's just very badly drawn and rhythmic. It only lasts a few minutes longer than Swing Time, for example, but it seems a lot longer. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. She's sweet and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" ("Get me behind me Satan", his other number, is a faint remnant of Top Hat, happily cut from this masterpiece). Tracking the fleet would be a bad movie if it were not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition competes for first place among all their numbers. The dance is just fantastic. "I put all my eggs in one basket" presents the two repetitions of a dance they have not perfected yet. Its imperfections make it all the more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is easily one of the best songs of Irving Berlin. The film deserves to be watched for its great moments.
