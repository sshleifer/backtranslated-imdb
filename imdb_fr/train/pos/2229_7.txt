I read terrible things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Confused, confused, horribly structured." Although some of these charges may be valid, this movie was not nearly as bad as your average DVD programmer. In fact, he had aspirations. He tried something beyond the typical nonsense of monsters / slasher. And by God, things are interesting. <br /> <br /> Madame Barbeau is a miracle to behold. She is wearing the right film on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> That does not mean it's a masterpiece. UNHOLY eventually collapses under the weight of his own ambition. There are simply too many (unexplained) subplots trying to coexist. And the flaws of the plot created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows that her mother is perverse and that she will eventually kill her brother, why does not she simply kill her? Ma in the very first sequence of the film? Looks like it would have been easier to travel in the future. <br /> <br /> However, I give UNHOLY points for trying. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
