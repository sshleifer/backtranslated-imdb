This film was extremely funny, I would like to own that for my 1970s vintage film collection to see the list again, I know this cast of characters, these are people I have met over the years and who are push to seek this comedy Unfortunately, this was never put on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx has always been a comedy clown, Pearl Baily a great match as a witty and sassy woman, Norman a son with a secret who does not know if he will have a future if he is out, Dennis Dugan, a man funny and crazy. Miss Dobson hooker with a heart and little consciousness. Love, lust, strange family ties, this film is qualified for a return performance, a situation comedy mixing various events, as it could and should find its way as a remake. I think finding a casting would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, except for Jerry. Seinfeld playing the role of Dennis Dugan, this points to some episodes of Seinfeld that reminded me of Norman too, that keeping them up close was surely impossible because it was impossible to reform a so-called girlfriend and heightened infidelity of a parent. This film was a wild sleight of hand, advises a taxi driver, remind me of the episode Kramer takes advice from his younger brother rather than his lawyer. (episode of Seinfeld) The parents have a moment of falling of the jaw, pleasure after the pleasure He shouts, bring me back.
