And if a platoon of G.I. of the Japanese army was to be sent back 400 years in the midst of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate? Very good, not true? The film does exactly what it says on the box. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the screenwriters did not bother to explain the ridiculous, usually ridiculous, science-fiction mumbo-jumbo science of time transport. Not how or why. They just did. However, the time transport sequence itself is triumphant and pretty enough, if not a little old fashioned. Not as silly as one could imagine. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows the premises of a t. But if he loses a bit of speed with the various secondary intrigues that follow the arrival of GIs in medieval Japan, he resumes with a devastating battle sequence. This is probably the main agenda. The concept as a whole, and by extension the film itself, is probably due to this simple argument: what would happen if G.I. were equipped with advanced technologies in modern warfare to fight the samurai? And the boy delivers. <br /> <br /> The main battle sequence that lasts more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in the action / war movies of the '70s. Not only is it relentless and exhausting in rhythm and length, it's also a great mix of styles and techniques that only unique places like GI Samurai can deliver. I mean, where would you have the chance to present tanks, ninjas with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurai in the same plane? The G.I. The platoon led by Lieutenant Iba literally rips up hundreds of extras and fells them with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mix of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the jidai Kurosawa's Kagemusha epic geki or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Banners, while the other is in action movies and western war. Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari, from Keoma, are evoked by stylistic touches (such as beautiful slow motion images and bloody violence). Japanese cinema has always been influenced by Westerns and other Hollywood works, and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai effortlessly transforms this East-West-West melting pot into an exciting film. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers happily take the film as a whole and the film benefits enormously. It's not that the ironic mentality is completely absent, it's just that she does not try to please a public as bad as good who likes to laugh at their movies. The budget was probably heavy, as evidenced by the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very suitable for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. The work of the camera and editing are at the top, almost better than a film without higher artistic ambitions deserves. <br /> <br /> It's not without its faults either. There are many scenes of "songs", where all kinds of 70s rock, disco and country songs are broadcast on montages (link scene, love scene, "war is hell" scene, etc.). The songs themselves are pretty lame and lame and hurt the whole thing. Although the pendulum lasts 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for most. Scenes, flashbacks and subplots from the first half could have been cut for a tighter effect. <br /> <br /> The cast also deserves mention, featuring personalities such as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf), Tsunehiko Watase (Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all of whom have reached good grades.
