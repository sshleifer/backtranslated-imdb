I loved this film. Great scenario and actors and good movie sets. It tells the story in a way that I can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can not find him anywhere. Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack. Besides not being able to find the soundtrack, I thought the movie was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is one of his best works. His past films were OK, but this one was really telling a story to change. It will go down in history as one of the best TV movies ever released. Congratulations to the producers and writers for such a great job.
