Barbra Streisand is a tour de force in this Hollywood story. His performances and songs are unique and are special in big movie theaters. The scene where she is presented to the audience not expected by Kristopherson, against the will of the crowds and his only to return it with his magnificent performance of "Woman In the Moon" is one of the best filmed examples of quality performer can win on an audience. It is true. The scene where she registers Evergreen ranks among the best in the industry. All live, no lip sync, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a diva, but she keeps her promises. She sings majestically "With One More Look At You, she deserved the Oscar she and Paul Williams got for Evergreen." Kristopherson had her moments too, well above most of her appearances at the movies. the franchise "Born" ranks with the first one of 1937 (Janet Gaynor, Frederic March) although I will still enjoy the musical remake of Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954. I have not yet seen the DVD and I do not know its quality.
