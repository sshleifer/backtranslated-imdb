Fatal Error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are part of the film. The actors of the film all played very well. Robert Wagner played well. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was nice. There may be a big age difference there, but they are a unique couple. Both actors worked really well together. The music of the movie is really good of Ron Ramin and corresponds very well to the film. There are a lot of things in the movie that you do not know what's going on and what's going to happen next, and this movie lets you go from beginning to end. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and Janine Turner, then watch this great movie!
