Ah, I loved this movie. I think there was everything. That made me laugh out loud more than a dozen times. Yes, I am a girl, so I write this from a girl's point of view. I find it unfortunate that he got only 5.2 points. Too many guys vote? It was well above other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman, I do not appreciate all the classy movies, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be superficial and not as funny as they were supposed to be. But as I said, this film had everything, almost, in my opinion. Super script, good one-liners, very good play. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character reminded Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives a lot, but what? It was great. I will keep this movie on rainy days, days when I feel weak and need to laugh.
