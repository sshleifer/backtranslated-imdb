This is one of the few films where I consider the restitution of the film as an improvement over the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional. I loved the cyclic interpretation of 'The old home guard' and the charming 'Portobello Road', a superb combination of early animation and real acting techniques that, although dated, do not detract from the charm of the room. The context of the Second World War worked well and was not forgotten during the start of the film, which happens so often in the stories "evacuated". <br /> <br /> A film often overlooked, it never ends. fun for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are exceptionally well done and the whole text is perfectly connected and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
