The film caught my attention, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts because the plot was not complicated. I had no trouble following him (some people may have had too much eggnog the night before). The movie was very sad and touching too. What else do you want? Alexa Davalos is a new talent (handsome too), and Tom Everett Scott is also doing a great job with him. The relationship between mother and daughter was perhaps a little unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the film was not. It was tragically sad but enlightening. He certainly beat other TV shows on New Year's Eve
