I'm bad at the free Boob references, so I'm just going to write a clearly flat criticism (no pun intended). I love Elvira, but not in a way "I'm going to draw the braggart", but suffice it to say that I think she rocks. The film is played as a horror movie of the 50's, but even more fun, look for the reference "Leasurely stroking ankle" to find out what I mean. The relay that shines in the film is the absolute charm of Elvira (or should it be cassandras). I saw this film for the first time at the age of 8, and I have seen it for years. I really should buy a copy, the video store version of the store is a little less beautiful. If other fans of the film want to send me an e-mail, do not hesitate. <br /> <br /> Another great performance by Edie McClurg (actress chicanerie) is an actress who never gets the attention she deserves.
