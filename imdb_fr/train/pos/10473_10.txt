I was in a bad mood when I saw this film for the first time. For some reason, it affected all my levels, family tensions, loneliness and the desire to share your life with someone. It did not hurt that the person to share your life with is a girl as beautiful as Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the sound track of this movie (very difficult to obtain). Loved it and hope it will come out someday on DV
