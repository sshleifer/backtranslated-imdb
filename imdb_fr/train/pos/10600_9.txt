It's a very funny comedy about Ealing, which tells the story of a community in central London who discovers that it is not English, but is an annex of the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> humorous actor Stanley Holloway (better known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as many other classic comic actors of the time. <br /> <br /> The story was apparently based on a news article at the time, when the Canadian government "officially" gave a hotel room to a visiting European royalty. The idea actually reminded me of the real case of the province of Hutt River in western Australia, where a landowner "separated" from the Australian government because of a dispute over the quota of wool. (This has never been recognized by the Australian or Australian Western governments). <br /> <br /> This is an excellent scenario that plays with many political and economic issues, much like the TV show "Yes Minister"; besides being an excellent little piece of eccentric character.
