This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. The weird story, the dark scenery, the bugs everywhere, the idea jumps and the dreams surreal ... Really great! People who like cult movies or very dark thrillers will find that fantastic. That sounds a little like David Lynch's films: the weird story, the weird dreams, the red curtains. Black Night contains almost no plot. It is rather a succession of surreal events, nightmares and meetings. This is a disadvantage. If the film had a really fascinating intrigue full of tension with a captivating denouement, I would give it a 10 out of 10. But that's missing, and that's why I gave the movie a 8. Nuit Noire is a movie to to watch absolutely. Look for this DVD and you will be rewarded!
