What a fun and sexy movie! They certainly do not do it anymore. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and have all kinds of sexual mishaps. The tone is strangely innocent, while the considerable nudity evolves out of stock in crazy situations, rather than in a manifest sexual desire on the part of the characters. It is only when actresses accidentally lose their clothes that male characters become endemic. Richard O'Sullivan literally gets "Randi" (sic). The film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as being located in nudie movies and naturist movies of the old school. My special interest for Au Pair Girls is that I am a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If an actress has always had a better nude look (she is slender but wonderfully curvy) or dressed, come on (I love her since the very first set of UFOs - who else could bring a purple wig!), I will eat my hat.
