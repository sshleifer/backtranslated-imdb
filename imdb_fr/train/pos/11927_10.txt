I must say that despite his criticism, Angels in the Outfield was a very good movie. I like the fact that it teaches children to always have faith and to never give up because, yes, miracles can happen. Unlike other baseball movies, this film stood out with its incredible special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I like this film, it has some shortcomings, some of which are irrelevant (that is, towards the end when Ray Mitchell strikes a circuit, he does not do his best and therefore would not be a score, but it's just a gag order.) I must say that I was really impressed by the presence and morale of this movie: Just have faith, do not give up.
