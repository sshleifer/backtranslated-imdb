Let me say first that this show was in the front row when John Ritter was there. At his death, the show dropped a little, but the producers did not give up, adding James Garner and David Spade to regular distribution from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The centers of the show around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, resting in peace), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was in the show, I screamed with laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that he's gone, I'm only laughing a little with occasional hearty laughter. I am very happy to have fallen into the trance of this show after Ritter's untimely death, because it has so much improved the eps with Ritter. <br /> <br /> The character of Ritter is so well played and so complete that it is possible not help but love it. He is always encouraging girls to go out together, but he really wants them to be happy. It's the ultimate dad who hates boyfriend entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also excellent, and she is also a nice character. After Ritter's death, his character provides such strength of influence and strength not only to his children, but also to Sagal, who shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, as she and Ritter were long-time friends . <br /> <br /> The funniest person in the series should be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. She's the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, weak-minded, yet he's an intelligent person. She is hilarious with her innocent "blonde" humor and her vanity. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson may look annoying like Kerry, but that's the goal of her character. The only flaw in the series is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about. She is still looking for Bridget, and her character feels as if she's inserted in it. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers, the solitary son of Hennessy, is hysterical, and when Ritter is in the series, he produces mainly comic material. At Ritter's death, the show provides some story lines for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner are just laughs, with the occasional side story of C.J., Spade's character. Garner plays Cate's father as basic information. <br /> <br /> In summary, I give an excellent review of this show because it was an excellent show that caused a tragic event that paralyzed it. You will appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 --spy
