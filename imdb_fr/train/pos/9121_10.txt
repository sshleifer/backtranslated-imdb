SPOILERS CONTENT TO OBTAIN AN OBSERVATION. <br /> <br /> Twenty years after 1984, this film says a lot about Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> A scene summarizes Prince's musical output over the past 10 years is perfect. If you remove the two best songs from his last 10 albums, you will get a fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene unfolds as well. Prince runs into his locker room after playing a song and the club owner enters the locker room to give Prince an ear for his fall from grace in the '90s and the release of albums that only the most hardcore are able to tolerate and endure. Support his artistic talent. <br /> <br /> Club Owner - "You do not pack them as before, the only person who digs your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! How about the musical underlining that makes Prince even meaner when he hits Apollonia on the ground in two separate scenes! It gave me shivers that it was not the only scene where the women were abused in this film. <br /> <br /> I am very much in favor of the argument between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, who stole all the scenes in which they were. But what was it funny to throw a woman in a trash? It was purely bad! The other nasty aspect was the chalk outline of Prince's father thoughtfully posed by the Minnieapolis police, making Prince even crazier! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertaining film as a whole, as it is the soundtrack of Prince's songs that increases its value by 110%. But the film gives us yet another theory about Prince and his music, because he tells us that the greatest song of Prince's film is written by Wendy, Lisa and his wife Princes beating their musical father! <br /> <br /> Are Prince and filmmakers trying to tell us that Prince had stolen all his best songs from his father after finding scores of songs written for his father? Maybe that's why Prince started to run out of steam in the 90's because he did not have his father's ideas anymore ??? ........... Hmmmm .....
