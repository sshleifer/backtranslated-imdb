After seeing several films from Villaronga, I had a pretty clear opinion about him. He focuses too much on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting the rhythm of the film. That's why, even though he has good reviews, his films have never caught the attention of the general public. In ARo, he follows the same course of action, but has really improved his pace, especially at the end of the film. Frankly, I slept in the first part, because although the first gives the necessary information, it is really slow. Nevertheless, the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes all the film the best film ever made by Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
