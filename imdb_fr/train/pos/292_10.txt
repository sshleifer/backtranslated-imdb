First, I got this movie as a Christmas present, so it was FREE! FIRST - This film had to be in stereoscopic 3D. It's largely, but every time the main character is in his car, the film falls flat in 2D! What!!?!?! It is not so difficult to film in a car! THE SECOND - The story is not very good. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why do they show all the deaths at the beginning of the film! This made the film worthless every time some people were killed !!! Watch it for a laugh, but do not waste your time buying it. Just download or something for cheap.
