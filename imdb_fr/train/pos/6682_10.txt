I saw it in theaters and I absolutely loved it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I have never seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a maid in paradise. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as Blue Raja, and I particularly liked the fact that the character is not really British. The scene with him and telling his mother that he was a superhero almost made me cry. I loved the fact that The Bowler spoke at the ball. Some of the funniest stuff involved Stiller and the furious rage of his character, Mr. Furious, and the fact that his threats and opponents were all gibberish and that they made no sense. I could barely stop applauding when he said "fraculater, Freinken-puss", it was said. But one of the things I appreciate most is that Captain Amazing dies in the movie. I highly recommend this film for all occasions, and I give it my own thumbs up.
