I had the first film of Bill and Ted for Christmas and the second when I saw it in a shop. This one was (I think) as funny as the first but a much more agitated story. It was funny to see how they had their own hell and how they had to play death. What's funny is that they played him in stupid little games like clues. The only thing I would change is that Station and Death are in the band, but other than that, it was great.
