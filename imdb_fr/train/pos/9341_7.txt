Sandler is fantastic again ... I have already become a fan of Sandler. This film is the saddest story of Sandler. His expression is fantastic. I cried more while watching Click but there are similar points. To consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say "I love you" are some of the most impressive truths of life ... It's hard, it's real ... and in reality, there is owner of this success, Binder. I do not think another director could give these emotions in such a way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since Crash. Do not expect to laugh or a very positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the realities of life, do not miss this movie.
