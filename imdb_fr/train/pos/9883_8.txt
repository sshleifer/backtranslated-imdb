He ran 8 seasons, but his first, in early 1959, and his last, in the fall of 1965, were shorter than seasons 2 to 7. CBS chef, William Paley, canceled the production of Rawhide after watching the first show of season 8, in September 1965, because he hated the series without Eric Fleming in the role of Gil Favor, left after season 7. The latest new episode aired in November 1965. The The only CBS broadcast of 1966, January 4, 1966, was a rebroadcast. <br /> <br /> I often wondered why Rawhide had not turned to color filming for his last season? Most of the 1960s westerns were already colorful in 1965. CBS was broadcasting in color this fall, for many of their sitcoms, but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last Western television series of September 17, 1966 (and the last series broadcast in prime time to switch to color) for the episode Snap Decision.
