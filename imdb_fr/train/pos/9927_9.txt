Domino is a good movie. This is a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom related to her lifestyle. She joins two hunting companions (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I have with this movie is that it focuses on the different things they do, instead of the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Even with that, Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke continues his Oscar performance in "Sin City" with another tough-guy performance. Edgar Ramirez does not really do anything except speak Spanish from time to time and staring at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good performance of support. Mo'Nique was herself, even though she surprised me on a particular scene. Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie, though, is the direction. Tony Scott's fast style really brings the film to life. Cinematography is one of the best I have ever seen. It takes a regular film and puts acid. All blacks are blacker, whites are brighter and have a kind of green glow. The action scenes are exhilarating. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL: If you like Sin City and Man on Fire, you'll love Domino.
