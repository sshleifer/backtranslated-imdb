This is probably Karisma at its best, outside Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar is also doing her best, without even trying. The story is sometimes very good, but in the end, it seems to drag on, especially when Shahrukh appears. What really pleased me was the performance of the tracks, the delivery of the dialogue, as well as the story, for what it was. It could have been better realized and edited. The deal was even brilliant, including Karima's mother-in-law, although she had only had one brilliant moment, it was great to watch her. <br /> <br /> The sets were also very good. I did not really like their portrayal of a Canadian family, but once they've moved to India, it's as real as it sounds. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'll give a thumbs up!
