Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is approaching puberty, begins to have strange dreams that begin to affect her in real life - involving a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers) she meets in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with really terrifying moments. Although it's a teenager and a PG-13, it's NOT for kids. Moreover, if you hate fantasies, stay away from yourself. But if you're up for something different, that's the bill. <br /> <br /> Well done by Bernard Rose with a beautiful score and some beautiful scary shakes. Burke is the only thing that prevents this film from being really good. She is not a very good actress (it's not a surprise if it's her only movie) and it hurts the film. However, everyone is great. <br /> <br /> Spiers is very good like Mark; Glenne Headley (pretending British accent) is also very good because Anna's mother and Ben Cross are both scary and friendly to Anna's father. <br /> <br /> A sleeper was hit in 1988 after being released. It's a shame - it's really good.
