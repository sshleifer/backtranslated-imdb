I gave this film a 10/10 with some reluctance because it is hard to praise something that haunted me and terrified me for years. The pure threat to the black-faced woman is pure horror, and the music that accompanies it only aggravates the fear. <br /> <br /> I saw this on TV when I was 10 and it really disturbed me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that so many other users have already said so. There are so many film reviews about how a movie can be disturbing or terrifying, but you can believe all those who posted on this forum, it's really an incredibly powerful thing. I mean, I like horror movies a lot, and I usually find them pretty amusing most of the time, but it's really threatening and will probably upset most people. I have not seen him since I was 10 years old and I am tempted to see him again, but I am afraid of having sleepless nights. I can not quite put my finger on exactly what it is, but I think it has to do with the fact that fear is the biggest weapon of the woman and that we, spectators, are just as likely that we feel the fear so intensely. It is remarkable that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I also saw the play, which was an excellent production ... but nothing can be compared to that.
