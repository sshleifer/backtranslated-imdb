HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror movies of the last decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and maybe the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon proves again that he can assume any role that belongs to him. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933, well, Kevin Bacon shocked us with * HOLLOW MAN. One of the most exciting horror films of all time. The action is intense and the chills are real. You may even find yourself jumping if you watch it in the dark on a stormy night. Secondary actors include Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. All do an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After testing on animals, they pass tests on humans. But someone must be the subject. Volunteer, Caine became invisible. But when his team is unable to return to visibility, Caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks revenge ... * end spoilers * <br /> <br /> The film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well in the next century. Became the basis of a parody joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets you go. The first 45 minutes are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiences work. The second half is exciting and seductive for most action and horror fans. Think about DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks into a crazy invisible man. And then change the water on fire and explosions. A cover of a shark killer movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
