Vampires, sexy guys, rifles and blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child offers all this in one well packaged movie! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who befriends a Kei vampire (HYDE), their relationship grows over time, but as Sho ages, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It does not help that they fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. It's a touching story, full of human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry again. Even if you're not a fan of their music, watch this movie. It works very well as an independent movie about vampires. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
