Yes, Shakespeare would indeed have been proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at her best but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on his side, was brilliant. His intrigues were wonderful, as were his relationships with the public. Very good work. <br /> <br /> There were sometimes too few dramas where more would have been expected. The Cassio massacre, for example, was a little clouded by too many events too far apart, which caused the viewer to turn his head to understand everything. Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness struck by Roderigo was unusual; boring even. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Othello before, see this. If you have not read Othello, see this. If you have not heard Othello, see this. On the other hand, you do yourself a favor by reading it, seeing it play on stage and hearing it sing.
