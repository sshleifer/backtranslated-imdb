Two years later, Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) become rock stars in the present but still need more work on their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted are part of public folk history, but a nasty man (Joss Ackland) is about to kill Bill & Ted by sending cyborg-like aliens to destroy them. The Cyborgs are sent to the present and they kill the real Bill & Ted. Now the two guys are spirits and they have to go through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) made an intelligent sequel with great visual effects. Much more fun and entertaining than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers a good anamorphic widescreen transfer (1.85: 1) and a very Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. DVD contains the theatrical trailer and a fun comedy behind the scenes. This sequel was a box office success like the original, but it's also (Believe it or Not), one of the best suites ever made (according to your point of view). George Carlin briefly returns to his original role. Pam Grier also appears in a small role. It's a fantastic fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
