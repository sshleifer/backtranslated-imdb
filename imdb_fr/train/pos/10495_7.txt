Saving Grace is a fun movie to watch in a boring afternoon, when you're looking for something different from the usual scripts and want to have fun. I mean, the idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana it contains is such a madness! This is the first film I watched with this theme (drugs / marijuana) that does not really criticize, but makes jokes. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the United Kingdom and has many financial problems because of her late husband, who committed suicide since he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who had imagined saving money for her, discovers that she has to pay all her husband's debts so as not to lose all her belongings, especially her house she loves so much. She had never worked before and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener who is very fond of smoking tobacco, decides to partner with her to sell marijuana on a large scale.
