The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I have loved. I love just about every shorts they've made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and are also featured by many other actors and actresses, many of whom were in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the funniest comic team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than husbands, watch out! All the characters in this short film are the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many fun parties here. It's a very hilarious short film. There is another short film similar to Three Stooges, called Brideless Groom, and I recommend both!
