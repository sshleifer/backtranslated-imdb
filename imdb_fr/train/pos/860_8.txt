Audiard made a very interesting film here. It begins with the description of a young woman almost deaf in her working world of secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Hiring a trainee as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life: but the guy just got out of jail. Their rejection by society brings them together gradually. The description of the characters is deep, goes into detail ... the two begin to help each other; because she can read on the lips, which is very useful for her ... It will evolve gradually, far from what it was at the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed; everything is very convincing, even if it ends up becoming a film noir. The gesture is particularly well observed in the shooting of Audiard. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated for the Best Actess Cesar Awards for her piece of magistrate. An action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple "study of morals". It's surprisingly entertaining: 8/10.
