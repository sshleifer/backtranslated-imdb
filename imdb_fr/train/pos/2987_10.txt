It's the weeper that Beaches has never been. Even though I wanted to love Beaches, I always seemed in a hurry to feel it (his soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though). Stella, on the other hand, is moving at a slower (and sometimes too slow) pace, and although it's a bit manipulative in her scary story about a self sacrificing mother, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast achieve great performances. 10/10
