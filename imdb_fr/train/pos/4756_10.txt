This is one of the most adorable episodes of Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogues and fun characters to break the tension of some terrifying moments. There's the usual blonde vamp dancer (what's going to make Serling so attractive for this kind of character, so that she continues to appear in various episodes?) And other characters varied, but it is the "old man" of Jack Elam who steals the show. I see this as the fun and light version of "The Monsters Are Due to Maple Street" - or maybe a 20-minute parody of Twilight Zone from "The Thing". On another note: I thought that the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually moved on - he looked familiar - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after just two credits televised in his name.
