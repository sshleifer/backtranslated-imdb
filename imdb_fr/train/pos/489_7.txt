When I got home after the movie, I hummed the familiar waltz music to which Natalia and Alexandre were dancing. I already heard that - where? Ah, in Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (Beach 2), I got it just when I got to the door. This is "Waltz No. 2 of the jazz suite No. 2" composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, played here by the Philharmonic Orchestra of the city of Prague. Yes, I went to get the Tower soundtrack. What a treat! The score of Alexandre Desplat's film was satisfactory - there are fifteen titles in addition to the two titles of the charming waltz. It's not often these days that we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a complete movie score. It reminds me of Maurice Jarre's favorite sheet music, Ennio Morricone (the opening notes of track 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barry. There are subtle nuances of notes and notes of the strings, the celestial, the piano and the harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro presented an extremely consumer-friendly parity performance. The love story, their intimate bond, exists between Alexander and Natalia - his childish but tormenting inner world, and his generous and daring understanding of him - a relationship to both of them. Director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (Best Foreign Language Film in the Netherlands, Oscar Winner of 1996) gave us a discreetly sensitive film - not without her troubling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family efforts , his love and respect. The main subject is the mental game and the mathematical logic of chess. Underneath may be a tearful tearful of a tragedy unfolding in the late 1920s. Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como, in northern Italy, near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the soundtrack if you do not want to go to the movies. The lyric score of Alexandre Desplat entitled "La DÃ©fense Loujine" is complete.
