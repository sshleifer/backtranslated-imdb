Being myself from a small town in Illinois, I can instantly understand this movie. Given the era in which it was made, city dwellers look like many people I grew up with. Yes the plot is so-so. And yes, the actor will not be nominated for an Oscar so soon. But that's not the goal. The goal is to suspend reality and have fun. And this movie has a lot of fun. From the greedy and indifferent banker to the well-meaning but confused MP, this film was created to make fun of the SciFi genre and the small town that lives at its best. Who can not smile at the sight of the Enforcer drone or the Vern Droid? and I loved the FarmZoid. I would have liked to have one when I was growing up. Overall, considering the technology they had at the time, it's a nice adventure in childhood, where you can sit on a Saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand, and make fun of Weaknesses of life in a small town. It's a movie that I would watch again and again, if only to make fun of myself and my little town.
