It's one of the greatest love story movies I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but that does not hijack the film. We must try to observe, criticize and appreciate all forms of art from the point of view of time. Clearly by "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However, judging from the perspective of America in 1925, he was fantastic. Similarly, Sayonara is a revolutionary film in his view of a MÃ©tis love story, the arrogance and American prejudices of "manifest destiny" and the complexity of different cultures. This is naturally the next step of films such as Gentleman's Agreement. However, his goal was not only a social comment, but rather entertaining and enjoyable, with countless verses that one does not forget. <br /> <br /> However, even taken in the light of a love story, he is awesome. Although some attack Brando's accent, he is at his best in terms of nuance and characterization. The buttons and Umeki (who both won the Oscars) and the rest of the secondary cast contribute a lot to the film. <br /> <br /> Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job of making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. His speech at his first meeting with Brando and his interview with him is a classic and it is rare, if not never equal, that it corresponds to cinema. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in his locker room in Tokyo at the end of the film is also good. Of course, he does not have the suction of the mouth, the exchange of spit and even worse, it illustrates the love in today's movies, but that only makes it better. It portrays true love and passion, not just "heat". If this movie does not affect you, then you are too young, too cynical or dead.
