Once, when I was at university and had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying "Do not boltay!", Which means "Do not chat!". I "translated" this for the "generation" of viewers by "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the curious neighbor on "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt. Snafu runs "Rumors", you see that it's not a matter of laughter. In this case, the unscrupulous soldier hears something about a bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis powers have attacked the United States. So, he tells someone, who says it to someone else, who tells it to someone else, and it goes on. As in "The Russians arrive, the Russians arrive", the story is more and more disproportionate each time, so that when it comes to Snafu ... well, you see what I mean! Yes, it is mostly propaganda about the Second World War - supplemented by a pejorative term for the Japanese - but I must say that the Pvt. The Snafu shorts were actually quite fun. Of course, since Dr. Seuss wrote and Mel White provided the vocals, it's not surprising that they came out pretty cool. Worth to be seen.
