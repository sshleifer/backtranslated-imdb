All I hear is how bad the animation is. It may not be what everyone expected, but look like this. Would you expect perfection in hell? I think the animation was done on purpose and dry. It was great to see his personality change in this film, knowing that the action will probably be as close as possible to the actual act. I hope a sequel very soon. If we want a live action, I think we could be better with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think Lady Death would be transferred to the movie. But anyway, I have the personal conviction that all the opponents about this movie are dead and wrong. No pun.
