Every child has this film that they play in VHS when they have nothing to do or when there is a babysitter. It was this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell you the plot in its entirety, I have seen at least 100 times and I can say that it is a good movie for children and family. <Br/> <br /> I still have the band, I have not watched it for 5 years, but maybe I'll get there this week and I'll be a kid for the day. <br /> <br /> You just have to love the care bears and their messege. <br /> <br />
