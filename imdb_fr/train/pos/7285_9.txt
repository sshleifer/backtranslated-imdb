This film scared me a lot when I was just a kid. He is not a "citizen Kane" but he has his moments. The scene of tearing of the arms is good. The plot is good even if the characters are not - it could have something to do with the acting. Put a few prominent people in the roles and then see what you get. It was one of those types of films shot, edited (the little that was) and distributed in a few months. It's classic science fiction with a small budget and merit. I gave him 9 other movies of the same kind and age.
