HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of Shemp's classic without a husband. The new cooking scene of the film at the beginning of the film is excellent. The stooges are always funny when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of cooking, we take back the original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these remakes from 1953 to 1956 is that they correspond to the new story. They make an insertion if the old story does not fit. <br /> <br /> Beware husbands have a new ending, but I will not give it to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars.
