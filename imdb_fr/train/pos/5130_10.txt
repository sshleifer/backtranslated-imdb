... It may seem exaggerated, but it is not. <br /> <br /> What's so hard to understand is - why did not they make more short music shorts like this? Is not the beauty of the thing totally apparent to everyone? I suppose not. So many short films have been made for commercial purposes only, and hopefully they could have some artistic value. This is an exception - the only one? - where it seems that the director had a vision and can clearly appreciate the music as art. Why did not anyone ever think of filming Lester or Charlie Parker at a concert? Crazy, man. <br /> <br /> Too bad there were no consequences. If you have seen something of similar quality, share it!
