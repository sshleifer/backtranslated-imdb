I was very interested to see this movie when it was released in theaters, however, I could not move. So, finally, he arrived on the shelves and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I put the DVD in the drive, settled down for a night of assassination and pressed Play. What followed was one of the most captivating films I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of murders in Wonderland, which led John Holmes (Val Kilmer), the biggest in the beginning porn in the early 70s in porn, was fascinated from the beginning, and the sensation of the film held me to the end until the very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film was less focused on murders than on previous events and the subsequent investigation. Apart from a few blood-splattered walls in the beginning and the actual projection of the murders towards the end, the film was more or less an attractive series of remarkable dialogue and acting. Val Kilmer sells me almost like a junkie porn star, and even the "beautiful but that's it" Bosworth was a joy to watch (and just for her appearance, mind you) <br /> <br /> Personally, I I felt the best The appearance of the film was, as I said, its failure to clearly show the murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not see completely the brutal hype given to the sleeping quartet. In addition, the sound effects of these murders were more than enough to whet my appetite. They were beating with lead pipes, there is not much to say. <br /> <br /> My only real problem is the brief appearance of Carrie Fisher. His portrait of the too religious figure was, I think, a little too clich√© of his appearance. Maybe this person was really part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold and, for some reason, Fisher seemed a little too "clumsy" in his portrait. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent movie is worth a look, even if once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
