For all those who wish to have an idea of ​​the Soviet vision of the history of modern Russia, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colors of old photographs that improve to black and white in the middle of the century and to color as the story approaches modern times (ie The 1960s). <Br/> <br /> The story centers on a boy from an isolated village in Siberia, marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist at the time of the tsarist. He later joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and introduced Soviet communism into his village. His son, of local beauty, fought the Germans during the Second World War. On his return to the village, the oil industry takes flight and we undergo a certain Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This film is long and slow, but quite logical and very well done. We can see it in three parts.
