I had the privilege of seeing excerpts from the original Aardman series in the UK. It was always fun and always funny. No part of the charm has been lost in the translation - it is as fresh as the interviewees - that part of it is written or not, as has been said, is beside the subject. It's always fun. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations shows a great imagination in the characters of each voice, unique aspect that I like most about the show and its concept (the hostility between pandas, porcupines discussing the fear of needles, monkey painting). Regulars also grow on you, such as the Maryland horse and donkey teens, most married couples (parrots, insects and cats, to name a few), and the voice of child, and I'm really digging the ferret! Monday has finally become a day of the future.
