At first, I had the reaction with which many people left after seeing this: that shots of fat people getting tanned, etc. were cheap shots somehow. OK then it makes diane arbus meets. . . it does not matter. . . but I quickly realized that this was not done in a dehumanizing way, as the images unfolded, I felt that the problem was entirely the public: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also films from almost everywhere watching people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something incomprehensible, something that should not be demonstrated. if it was all the movie offered it would be a good deal. However, the story of the woman with her violent boyfriend and her drunk friend resonates like a ton of bricks: a very eloquent narration, incredible performances and to think that the scene was improvised. This blond guy is an actor of genius. Finally, I want to contradict those who say that this film shows how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is getting ready with the woman who finally dances for him is quite an OK character who breaks this mold, so do not oversimplify the film by neglecting it. yes his dog is killed. it is not a rosy picture of the world but it is not the case. . . completely hopeless. anyway, I felt very grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film. I would not say that each of the sons was as strong as the strongest, but I would say that this movie kicks ass and highly recommend it. . .
