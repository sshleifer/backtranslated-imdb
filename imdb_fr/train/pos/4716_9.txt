This movie is just too funny, a totally crazy gangster. If Mel Brooks was taking a picture of the crowd in the 1930s, it would probably look like this. Too many big monotypes to remember, and although it's not for everyone, whoever does NOT laugh a lot of times does not have a pulse. So, put it on and I READ YOU Iceholes !!!
