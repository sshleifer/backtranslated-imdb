Generally, I like something light and fun, so this movie should not have attracted me. But it caught me right from the start. The story of a family's choices and challenges seems obvious, but it continually raises the question: "What if it's my family, my choice?" I cried and laughed when they did it because I really felt what the people involved were feeling. It was in places that were hard to look at, but harder to hijack. The story is true and life is sometimes hard to watch! This shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. Like in real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do what they do!
