I thought the movie was really good. I enjoyed the acting and it worked well. The director seemed to really understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to spend but they were very observable. When you see a movie like this on a budget, you need to consider it when you watch it. Some things might be better, but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good the F / X and the cascades well done. Two standout people were the guy who was playing the role of the camera. and the boy who played the child. This kind of film allowed LA to continue to work and it was a movie that turned out to be ok.
