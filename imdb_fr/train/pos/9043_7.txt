I stumbled upon this movie on TV one day. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel not particularly known for broadcasting good movies. This one, however, was nothing less than good. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by Sputnick's launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends start building rockets. His father is not happy about his son's hobbies and would rather see him become a coal miner or go to college with a football purse like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. . A little too predictable maybe, but it's okay because it does not focus too much on these parts of the story. This is an important part, but where it shows, the internal action is centered on the action between the characters. The story is good. There are clich√©s, but it's okay. It's based on real events, so you can not just drop those snapshots. The characters are really good. Where the story is in a descent, the characters are out and manage to maintain the action and quality of the film. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and credible. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie. The settings and style of the 50s are meticulous and the images are well composed and well lit. All this gives a great atmosphere to the film. <br /> <br /> The acting game is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers an excellent performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good at John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast, they are good too. All together, it gives a casting strong enough. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm happy to have taken this film. It was first after seeing it that I learned that it was based on real events. If I had known that by seeing it, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie that everyone can enjoy. It's a bit of a good movie. Not bad at all!
