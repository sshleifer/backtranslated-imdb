THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most "moviegoers" stayed home watching their new 7 "TVs. Motorola: Almost all the recent numbers are wrong, because they can not adjust inflation.The current 10-dollar movies will dominate.In 1951, the cost of the tour was 90 cents to 1, 60 dollars to Radio City, from 44 to 75 cents for the first time at Loew's Palace in Washington DC What counts is the number of people who reacted to the photo, not a "media scenario" in the box- The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO is that the filmmakers interpreted most of Enrico Caruso's life 90% of the film was music-centered, so MGM gave us the best live opera singer MARIO LANZA performing the music of the best opera singer ENRICO CA RUSO: It's a pity that LANZA is throwing his life and career away from eating too much. Too big to play THE PRINCE STUDENT, Edmund Purdom has taken his place - with the doubled voice of Lanza, and with the beautiful and beautiful Lanza illustrated in the advertisement. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not be put off by the low price, it only reflects the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the film.
