A tenth of me, a perfect ten would have been if there had been a plot for the film, but nevertheless, Moonwalker remains to this day a fun festival of music, dance and entertainment. Beginning with the editing of video clips of Jackson's long career, this reminds the viewer why he is often considered the "king of pop". From his hit "I want you to come back" to "We are the world", the charity record that has been awarded several times for Africa. After that, a short film, though dull in an Oscar-winning screenplay, nevertheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. Finishing with a perfect interpretation (sexy!) Of "Come Together". Something that the whole family can watch and enjoy.
