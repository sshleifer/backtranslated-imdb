The Movie Freddy's Dead The Last Nightmare is just as awful and disturbing as any other nightmare on Elm Street, so it has the essence of comedy about it, as do all the other movies, but how can we say that you will not find Freddy Krueger scary, if you meet this man in your dreams, you would not find him even more scary with a comical essence about him, because his comedy shows that he does not care about killing you, he is extremely funny, and Freddy also plays comic games with them, which, in his own way, is very disturbing. Using his comic ways, I think the nightmare horror movies on elm street are what they are today. The writers are extremely intelligent in making Krueger scary as opposed to Jason Vorhees, who says nothing and does not mind to scare his victims, this movie is about as good as Freddy's mind and I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and the path "Do not go to sleep!"
