This film is an entertaining, fun and quality movie. The film very intelligently follows the guidelines of the book and tries to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all appropriate and you expect them to be part of it. They use famous actors who give a great effect on the film. The graphics are a little sketchy in some parts and there are a lot of errors throughout the film. For example, there is no yellow-spotted lizard. The camp is not as horrible as explained in the book, and they tend not to show what's going on in the camp as much as the book. His whole group is mentioned in the book, but not in the film. Overall, a good movie for a rainy afternoon
