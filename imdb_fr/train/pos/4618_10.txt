I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen when this film was released and I can tell it. It would be a movie that I would show my kids to let them know, their feelings are normal. It's funny to see how we could be so devastated by things at such a young age ... who knew we were going to bounce ... again and again ... Super movie !!!!
