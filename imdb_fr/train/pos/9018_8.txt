Despite its discreet publication in this country and its apparent contempt in other countries (the rating "R" in the United States could not help - honestly, just because HBC uses the keyword!), This is in fined. artwork. Sentimentality sometimes threatens to stifle it, but it is overcome by the play of the first two. <br /> <br /> It's easy to win applause just because you play a physical or mental handicap (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter may only capture not be quite the physical degradation of the MND, but his vocal stretch and his ruthless emotion fully compensate. In fact, almost all of his performance is driven through his eyes (and what eyes!). It's a clever turn on the part of an actress who quickly defeats her reputation of English Rose and presents herself as a figure of some stature. The rewards must surely follow, but not, alas, for this great performance. <br /> <br /> Branagh, it is thought, has never really done his best in the film (except maybe "Hamlet", and his game has been diluted by mass distribution). Here, however, he dominates his other appearances, playing at most a disgusting, unstable, finally adorable dude with a subtlety that he has not always shown, and showing both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe it, just as much as we could not believe it in Frankenstein, as a priest in "The Proposition", as a lawyer in "The Gingerbread Man", and even as Andrew in "Peter's Friends" . This is probably his best performance so far - so why could not he produce the goods much sooner? <br /> <br /> As a movie, it looks more like a TV offer and, without its stars, it probably would not have much value. But it was a pleasure to see this pair playing their socks like that, and I look forward to more things from them (though it's not 'Love's Labor's Lost' ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
