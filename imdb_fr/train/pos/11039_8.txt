That's what I would call a good horror. With occult / supernatural nuances, this pretty French low-budget film caught my attention from the first scene. This proves that you do not need wild effects or a lot of blood to make an effective horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison and each of these characters (and their motivations) become progressively more interesting, while the film rises in tension until the final. Most of the actions we see through the eyes of Carrere, who has just entered prison and who has to get used to living with these other 3 inmates. <br /> <br /> I will not say much because this film really deserves to be more widely seen. There are, however, some flaws: the FX are not very good, but they are used effectively; the plot leaves some mysteries open; and things get very confused towards the end, but Malefique redeems herself at the end of the process. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
