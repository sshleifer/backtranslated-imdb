good movie, good music, good background and acceptable plot. but the main point once again that his films tend to be, the man is the best actor in the idia and can turn dust into gold. Nana Patekar. this may be his second best performance after parinda (others may disagree). although other films are not far behind. a man who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> good movie even though i think shahrukh was a luxury that this movie could have happened. you can see it in his films, others try very hard to reach his heights and act on their skin. but this man is really something elased. <br /> <br /> the film is cool, the music and the direction is excellent, the plot a little thin but the screen plays and dialogue again very well. a must watch.
