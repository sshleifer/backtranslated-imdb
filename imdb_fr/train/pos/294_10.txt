Critical and financial flop at the first exit, the critics turned around and said that this film was one of the best of the director. The style of the film quickly resembles that of La Ronde, while members of a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) pursue, fall in love with some of the most bizarre women and beautiful views on the film ( Audrey Hepburn Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Much of the script was released or rewritten on the day of filming, giving the film a fresh feel. Ben Gazzara is excellent as a chief detective persuading Audrey Hepburn to have dropped singer Colleen Camp and to have seen taxi driver Patti Hansen aside. John Ritter unsightly follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has some girls he is pursuing (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This film presents excellent performances realized by a large distribution. The stars are Audrey Hepburn (she has no line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic song) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as a manic country singer Christy Miller. It's a pleasure to watch her as she draws her lines in a rat-to-tat-tat delivery. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
