I do not understand why they decided to release this film to present to the American public the dynamo that is Jet Li. Fist of legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is not great, but it's certainly not great either. The last fight sequence is staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who then coordinated The Matrix. But the English version suffers from editing and dubbing. (I beg Hollywood studios to release these uncut movies with subtitles.) Jet Li shows her characteristic charisma in the lead role and FranÃ§oise Yip plays a cool and short role as a 701 woman. > Black Mask has a strange Gothic style that adds some interest, but is overloaded with battles and explosions. You had to put more emphasis on Li's fantastic physical abilities. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and get Fist of Legend if you want to see a great movie that really shows Li's skills.
