Do not be swayed by opponents. It's a wonderfully scary movie. It was a thesis project for screenwriter / director JT Petty. He did a great job of getting me on the edge of my seat. I never really knew what to expect, and for a jaded horror movie lover, it's Nirvana! The film is about an elderly man living in an isolated log cabin in the woods. One day, while looking for his cat in the woods, he witnesses the murder of a child, or is it? He dying about it the rest of the film. The peculiarity of this film is that there is no dialogue until the last scenes. I found it intriguing. The writer manages to get your hands on your senses and pulls them tirelessly. Launch this movie, you will not be disappointed.
