It's really one of the best movies about love I've ever seen. This film is closely followed by "Before Sunset", which is technically not a film at all, since it is the same two people and the same novel. <br /> <br /> It's "love" in the real world. OK, it is only if most people are as intelligent and as eloquent as the protagonists of the film. Reading other reviews, I am pleased to know how so many people are so crazy about dialogue-based movies. And that's what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and funny. It's no surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love, "but you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the coffee where they pretend to call their best. friends, with the other claiming to be best-mate, that's perfect, that brings you back to the moment when you fell in love with love for the very first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I must say that if you have a choice, look at "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before Sunset." If like me, you first looked at "Sunset", it's hard to dispel the feeling of pity and sadness of two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Once again, the greatest romantic film of my books: a wonderful acting, an excellent screenplay and beautiful places.Young love, at best .
