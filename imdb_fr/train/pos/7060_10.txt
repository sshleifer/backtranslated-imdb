Many people commented that this film was far from being as good as the first. Well, maybe it's not ... for you. However, how does your child react? Well, mine loved him more than the first. <br /> <br /> Disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little tough for little kids. (For example, Bambi's mother gets shot.) This movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who loves humor and happy ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to be snobbish about what the Disney standards should be based on the past - ignore this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a pretty little girl or a tender-hearted little boy that you really want to please, buy this movie and treat yourself to a tender meal for your little ones. This film is ideal as a movie at bedtime to make sweet dreams instead of nightmares. I'm happy with a film that pleases my child and does not need to impress parents all the time.
