The Good Thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are fun scenes. It also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect someone else's life without you knowing it. It's a small world and this little film shows us. <br /> <br /> The bad thing: there are too many characters and it's hard to say who the main character is but it's still a good movie. <br /> This is a good movie and many people compare it to Magnolia that I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated --- I would say PG -13 for brief violence, some linguistic and sexual situations.
