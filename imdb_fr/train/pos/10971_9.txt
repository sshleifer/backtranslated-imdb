Gray Gardens is shocking, fun, sad and hypnotic. I watched with astonishment the efforts of Ediths Jr. and Sr. to bicker and perform by recalling their past. Their existence in a dilapidated mansion (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a comedy and a tragedy. It's a movie you will not soon forget.
