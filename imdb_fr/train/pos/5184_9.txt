A deeply humorous and yet honest comedy about a group of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who are invited to return for a week at Tomawka, a camp in Ontario Canada by their former client (Alan Arkin). Screenwriter / director Mike Binder has benefited from his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a soft and understanding thread that makes sense. In addition, the film contains many fun moments, some of which are completely bizarre, like my favorite, which is to use tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Suspect Suspects", "Three Kings") provides the film with impressive images of the Canadian wilderness. Among the actors, Sam Raimi, director of the films "THE EVIL DEAD" and "The Gift", appears here as the fiery right arm of Arkin. One last thing, this film reassured me that a camp does not have to be the scene of bloody murders.
