<br /> <br /> Arriving in New York, in the car-packed, the clever young woman with the face of baby begins to make a methodical way to the higher floors of power in a large bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as an amoral heroine of this pre-code influential drama. Without a hint of modesty or regret, she coldly manipulates the kidnapping or destruction of unlucky men to find herself in her own way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck here has every opportunity to deploy his talents. <br /> <br /> Appearing quite late in history, George Brent is a welcome addition, as he is probably able to handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated acting style is a good counterpoint to his icy behavior. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker describe a succession of his unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> John Wayne appears for just a few seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for Stanwyck's affections. It would be the only time that these two artists appear together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Movie legends should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy client, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as bank executives - all unbilled. <Br /> <br /> The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly punctuated by the plot, is ?? Baby Face '(1926) by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and ?? St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W. C. Handy. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is an excellent example of pre-Code malice. In his frank treatment and without excuse of the sex, it is precisely the kind of film that the application of the Code of the production in 1934 was supposed to eliminate.
