I love this game to death. Since the age of 9 (I'm 15 now). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and do not forget the ultimate dragon shapes! I'm still waiting for a remake, a prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero. In this adventure, you meet wonderful creatures and boss battles. You also meet friends on the way who have their own special item. Such as fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also objects called dragon spirits, which allow you to turn into magical legendary creatures. Dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures that you will face in this adventure of thrills. One of my favorite games of all time, The Legend of Dragoon!
