The dentist was done at the time when almost every profession had his psychopath. We had crazy police officers, paramedics, secretaries and that was just to start. The dentist arrived surprisingly late because the appointment at the dentist is usually the nightmare of all men. <br /> <br /> The plot is distorted. A very clean dentist, Dr. Feinstone leads a perfect life in his big "white house". He has a beautiful blond woman and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of an evil IRS (Earl Boen of Terminator), a dirty pool cleaner "cleaning up" his wife and, suddenly, everyone seems to have passed through the filter black. He goes crazy and starts to take care of people's teeth in the nasty way. And you do not want to come on his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna has produced some elegant horror films like Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film, Society, was a nice fallout from John Carpenter's They Live. Film producer Pierre David is known for his films as Scanners. Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from Law Law and Major League, but I could later dream him as a psycho dentist. In fact, he was great in his role and he was pretty sad. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and silly as a wife of Feinstones. Micahel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after seeing him with ladies from the neighborhood, I knew my future job. Ken Foree (The dawn of the dead, From Beyond) was handsome as a cop in the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager about to be Feinstone's next client. <br /> <br /> Last Warning: If you are like me and have a dentist problem, you may want to ignore this one. But if you want to try, you have to prepare with black humor and very bad exercises.
