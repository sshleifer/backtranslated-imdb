What would you expect from a movie called 'Surviving Christmas' and presented as a 'festive fun', something like Ghandi or an English patient? I like a lot of things in this film, it's funny, it's very well interpreted and it's superbly written. I came to the movie as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort, but I was dubious when I read the plot, it seemed ridiculous. But the film does not look like this because Affleck (as Drew Latham) plays his role perfectly: an adult, a moment, an adult, a mature man who realizes he has won everything in the world. life, except what he really wants. In fact, we see Latham growing up in this film, when he meets the problems of those he wants and realizes that their life is not so good, he sees that his fate is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This film has fewer weak or failed scenes than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is much harder than any other kind of drama, whether it works or not, and very few writers can correct it every time. I particularly loved the dramatic scene, where the family read passages written by Latham. The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). This is the dilemma of greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing in front of the Christmas tree to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving. <br /> <br /> The addition of Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate) in the story brings a charming romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course, he is nerdy and artificial; he is rich and handsome, she is beautiful and single, and inevitably, she and Afflect end up falling together in the snow and meet face to face. Awesome! One thing I would have liked to do was use more festive music to make the atmosphere stronger, but I can not really complain. I had what I wanted.
