This is one of my favorite movies of all time, PERIOD. I can not think of another film that combines so many great cinematic qualities like this one. This film has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good against Bad and even a little Romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta). Best of all, you do not have to be in Mensa to "have it" and enjoy the movie as you do with other Miyazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I watch movies to make a pause while thinking). This is an exciting movie that will please everyone, so treat yourself and buy it. The only sour note is the American dubbing. I thought Vander-Geek was just annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the game of two discs and it tears! Who cares not to understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a secondary level, watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
