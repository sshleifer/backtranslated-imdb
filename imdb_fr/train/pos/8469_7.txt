I usually love these 1930 1930s crime and Charlie Chan movies, and that's no exception. However, something seems wrong with this movie. A late attempt to move from cerebral motorcycle movies centered on plot intrigues to a salad bar marred by comic relief as relieving as sore feet. A jester of characters appears from nowhere, imitating a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem entangled in a comical relief. The plot may seem strange or a mere excuse for us today, but at the time, the possibility of period archaeological discoveries was not only real, but also a trivial event.
