Yakitate! Ja-pan is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his career to make the perfect Japanese bread or Ja-pan, for Japan and for the Japanese, who will be recognized world whole. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's only from the outside. In reality, Yakitate! Ja-pan does not really concern bread, but the reaction that occurs after eating bread and the pun that accompanies the reaction. The series is adorable because of these puns. Popular anime titles such as Naruto, Inspector Conan and Dragon Ball to blockbusters such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. Everything is there. <br /> <br /> So how is this title different from other titles like Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike others who use cooking to dominate the world, Yakitate! Ja-pan is purely comical. Of course, there are times when the story turns to drama or even murder, but the comical atmosphere makes you laugh. You will laugh at their own vision of the sky. Just watch it. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is also a fiction, although some of the breads made here are made from real bread. Eating homemade Japan # 2 will not turn you into Super Saiyan or turn your body into rubber.
