"Scoop" is, without a doubt, Woody Allen's funniest movie of the 2000s. Allen, although he looks as if he was his age, is at the top of his game as a low-key magician Sidney Waterman. His one-liners and his behavior are hilarious. Do not let critics influence your opinion. "Scoop" is an excellent picture "Woody-Lite". <br /> <br /> The classical music score is an excellent complement to the on-screen action. Scarlett Johanson is beautiful in this swimsuit. Jackman rushes. Cinematography shines. "Scoop" is a wonderful escape rate from start to finish. The last shot of the film alone is worth the entry price.
