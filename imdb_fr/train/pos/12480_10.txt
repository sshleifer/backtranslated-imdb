April 1, 2001, jodelle ferland 'Won', best actress in a televised drama, at the price of the young artist, in studio city, ca. I can see why they have 3 nominations. Mermaid is a true story, during the cridits they have the real family on set, something you do not see often. you can find mermaid at any successful video store. look at it, you will be glad to have done it.
