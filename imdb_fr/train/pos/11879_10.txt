It's one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> If the film has a defect, it is because it attacks you like a rabid bull. It does not engage the viewer so much as to attack him. "Scarface" is as voracious and unyielding as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> Moroder's languorous synthpop is perfect for action. Like the chorus of a Greek tragedy, he cries and groans, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate. <br /> <br /> Not so much a history of caution as an ongoing disaster, '' Scarface '' rips the screen with the unstoppable strength of a runaway train.
