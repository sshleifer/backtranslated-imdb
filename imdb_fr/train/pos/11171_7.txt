Overall, this movie has been great for its time and will be interesting for many generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate compared to the book, everything is correct. The film goes far ahead and lacks important roles. I found the book, I'm ready and I immediately wanted to make a film (because I had not discovered the film yet), but later I found the film in a basket of good business at Wal-Mart and I decided to buy it to see if that was what I expected. Overall, I give this film a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative precision and overall meaning) and for its bad parts (big swings of time and minimal but notable inaccuracies).
