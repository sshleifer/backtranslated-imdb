Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just married an older man and on the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not want her. Her disappointment with the marriage and the deprivation of love causes Eva to return to her father's house on a farm and leave her husband behind. One afternoon, while swimming in a lake, her horse escaped with her clothes and a young worker recovered and returned the clothes to Eva. They fall in love with each other and fall in love. Later, she misses her husband and tries to bring Eva home. Eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place, ending the case tragically. I just watched "Ecstasy" for the first time, and my first remark concerns the horrendous quality of the VHS published in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the film only lasts 75 minutes and it seems that it was used different reels of movie. Some parts are totally damaged and others are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not realized by the Brazilian viewer, if he has the chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or sale. The film is practically a silent film, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. As a result, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very daring, with the exhibition of beautiful breasts and big naked body of Hedy Lamarr for the current standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers, symbolizing sex between Eva and her lover. The way the director directs the scenes to show Eva's needs and hardships is very clear. The inconclusive ending is also very unusual for a 1933 film. I liked this film, but I hope that one day we will have the opportunity to see a restored version of 87 minutes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "xtase" ("Ecstasy")
