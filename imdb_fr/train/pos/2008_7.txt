The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work since they did not use any of the original characters. I was quite surprised how it went. In general, the suites are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. Although this one was not a good movie, the writer did a good job keeping intact the main themes and tradition of the vampires. Jon Bon Jovi was a disadvantage initially, but he turned out to be a killer at half the average. I doubt anyone can beat James Wood's first performance, though ... unless you bring in Buffy! <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a decent watch and I would watch it again. <Br /> <br /> I had two questions left, however ... What happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a killer? I guess we'll have to leave that to the imagination.
