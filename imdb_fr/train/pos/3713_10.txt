With this movie, it's all about style, atmosphere and acting. Certainly, I did not believe in all the developments of the plot, but that did not matter - the fantastic acting, the unexpected twists of the plot and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me and dragged me along of the road. good time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor but also a master of accents, and he proves it once again with a perfect Georgia accent. He is surrounded by so many talents in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Schindler's List and Fallen's Embeth Davidtz, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I was blown away. I recently bought a copy of this movie and I do not get tired of watching it. Simply one of the best thrillers of the year. If you have ignored this movie (and chances are you have it), then I suggest you check it out.
