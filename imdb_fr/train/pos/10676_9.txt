This film was shot in Gerard Gardens, Liverpool, and was the UK's response to such films as "Blackboard Jungle". The film stands pretty well in the test of time, with all the moral stories always (or even more) relevant today. The film features great performances by major British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker embodies a Liverpool policeman assigned to liaison with minors. It is a principle that if you catch children from an early age, they will become responsible adults. <br /> <br /> Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are real-life brothers and sisters) who are caught in a network of arson attacks. Tsai Chin still plays and can be seen in Nicole Kidman's latest film, "The Interpretor". <br /> <br /> Violent Playground offers a gun seat in a school. It is therefore unlikely to be shown on television after similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the film was shot (even though it was not born at the time), and I have fond memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens featuring excerpts from "Violent Playground" and a small British film "Coast to Coast" starring Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The homes were demolished in 1987 and the films help preserve the memory. <br /> <br /> When the film was released, residents complained that the film was poorly described. Time has helped heal these wounds. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a film, I recommend you looking for it
