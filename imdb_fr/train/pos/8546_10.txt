This is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made! Although I've only seen forty minutes and I have to say it's a good movie. The plot is so funny and because there is sex around every corner of this movie. It's really funny and I do not see how anyone could like this movie. I really really want to watch the rest of the movie. There is a scene a little sick (believe me, it's not very nice) but other than that, it's a very good movie. I rate this movie 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for intrigue. Please, if you are a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie in which there is almost all sex, buy it. You will like it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
