This movie is great. kind of. it's really saying a lot or doing a lot, but it's a great movie to watch because of its stupidity. High school is supported by ms.togar of evil who hates the only thing that all students love, rock & roll. Riff Randle get tickets for everyone for the Ramones show, and this movie culminates with a takeover of the school led My Randle Riff & the Ramones. this film has it all, a bad script, a dubious staging, bad actors (clint howard & pj soles), a brilliant soundtrack, an extreme campyness, these elements and many others combine to make it what he is, a classic. <br /> <br /> note - during the live Ramones, note that the crash of germs is in the foreground. neat-o.
