I am curious to know which Beckett rifle was used in the film, as well as the caliber of the bullet he was supposed to shoot. If this is based on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I guess it's a 7mm. round. I am also curious about the rifle itself. He also made a comment in the latest Sniper movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese man had let him use that belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know which rifle is that too. I know this rifle was made around World War II or before. I just could not watch him closely watching the movie to identify him. <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Hathcocks, he pulled the longest of his 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed decisive attacks and 14 unconfirmed kills. After being healed from injuries in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching the USMC snipers the skills they would need on the ground. His career as a sniper is always mentioned to our brothers and sisters who are training at the USMC. I discovered his name from my friend who is a former sailor. Any information would be great.
