It's too bad that many people did not understand this and the next episode. <br /> <br /> But do not worry! I'll explain it to you too :) <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. <br /> <br /> Now, what people have not understood is that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. in this episode, he talks about his preparation for his death. He loses his own identity and even ends up forgetting himself, so he disconnects all his connections with this world. You'll notice what I say on the doctor's stage, where Tony says he lost his briefcase that contains "his life". They really did a great job of interpreting their own thoughts about what happens when we die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole plot, you will find that this episode and the next is a unique thing, with great spiritual meanings. <br /> <br /> As with all soprano episodes, filming and filming are superb. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand is what is the role of the monks. I'll watch it until I see that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this episode really touched me and I do not think anyone can better see what happens in an almost life-threatening experience. <br /> <br /> 10/10 probably.
