Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in the black tale of Kurt Vonnegut. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during the Second World War. After the war, he lives anonymously until rival factions wish to search his past. As in most of Vonnegut's works, it is a meditation on the absurdity of war and on those who use propaganda for their own ends. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident like young Campbell, then broken and haunted as the old man forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)
