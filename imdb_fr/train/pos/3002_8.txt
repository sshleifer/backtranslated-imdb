"The Kennel Murder Case" starts the race and does not stop until the end. Everyone had reason to kill the victim and several people tried. William Powell is great as Philo Vance, detective. Mary Astor is refreshing as a perverse niece who only wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her heritage. This movie comes with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disc (or download it to your local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!
