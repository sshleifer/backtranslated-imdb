I really liked this movie. The three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris is pleasantly above. The lighting and shooting angles of some scenes of Harris make his face really diabolical. The surprising turn of the plot in the end makes it interesting. Not a good movie, but a nice movie. I gave him 7 out of 10.
