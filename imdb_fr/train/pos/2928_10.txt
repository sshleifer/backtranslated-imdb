EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the funniest standing concert movie I have ever seen. Most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point, but not this one. For 90 minutes, there is not a moment that is not fun. From the moment Eddie makes a hilarious impression of Mr.T, the laughter keeps laughing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1983 and Eddie did nothing so funny. It's amazing that the man who wrote this incredibly bright emission wrote a film called HARLEM NIGHTS, that was not very funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're there, come back and do a concert. film in the vein of DELIRIOUS. Believe me, your fans will love you for that. And I think you know it.
