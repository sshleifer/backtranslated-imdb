We first watched this film as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at Walter Reade. Although we liked it, we did not think it was extraordinary. Looking at it for the second time, we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during one of the darkest days of Argentina, as the DeLaRua administration ended. The country was in turmoil after the economy, which had flourished in the early 1990s, under the artificial climate created by President Menen. It was a time when dollar bank accounts were frozen and people were living in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins when Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired because of the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving the sympathy of his wife, she takes him out of the apartment and becomes, for all intents and purposes, a homeless man. He goes down the street trying to make ends meet. <br /> <br /> The other story presents Ariel, a young Jewish girl, who is interviewed for a job in a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle that he gets the job. His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of El Once, in the city center. Things go from bad to worse when Ariel's mother suddenly dies. Only Estela, the young woman in love with Ariel, comes to the rescue of her father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, a clean man, must take showers whenever he can. He chooses a women's room in one of the subway stations. When the companion, Elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but she regains her senses when she realizes the unfortunate circumstances of this man who has experienced better times. They fall in love, and Santamarina, on one of his trips through the garbage of the street, finds a baby. Elsa, although surprised, wants to make the right choice. But Santamarina convinces her that the meaning of an innocent life in their life will cement their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who has met the beautiful Laura at work, starts a turbulent and heavy sex with her beautiful worker, who, without his knowledge, is involved in a lesbian affair. Ariel, who frees her mind by photographing weddings and other occasions, feels a passion for Laura, but realizes what Estela sacrificed to help her father and still loves her. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrazo Partido" we found excellent, works wonders with this film. Things are well put into perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having seen it the first time. The nuances of the play on screen that Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote are more meaningful, as they better reflect the turmoil the country experienced during those dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, has already collaborated with Mr. Burman for surprising results. He is not "handsome at the cinema", yet he is handsome. This actor projects a great sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another wonderful surprise. His Santamarina is disarming. Despite all the bad things that have fallen on him, he keeps an optimistic attitude towards everyone he meets. Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with Elsa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentinian actors plays the small role of Simon. The beautiful Chiara Coselli is interpreted as Laura and Melina Petrielli as the noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Esperando al mesias" proves that Daniel Burman is a voice to be reckoned with in Argentine cinema.
