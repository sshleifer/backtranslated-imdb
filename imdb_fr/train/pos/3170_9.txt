Screenwriter / director / co-star Adam Jones is moving towards great things. That's what I thought after watching his feature film "Cross Eyed". It is rare that an independent film leaves me as happy as his own. Intelligently written and brilliantly directed, "Cross Eyed" keeps you involved from start to finish. Adam Jones may not be a known name yet, but he will be. If this movie had one or two "Named Actors", that would be a hit at the box office. I think it still has a chance to be seen by a main audience if only one distributor takes the time to work this movie. No matter where it ends, if you have the opportunity to see it, you will not be disappointed.
