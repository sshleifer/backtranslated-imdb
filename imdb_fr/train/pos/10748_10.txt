I must say that the events of 9/11 struck me only when I saw this documentary. It took me a year to get through it. I was the one who changed station on the radio and channel on TV if it was about towers. I'm tired of hearing about it. When it was broadcast on television a year and a day later, I was scolding my eyes. It was the first time I cried since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I watch it now on television, 5 years later, and I still cry about tragedies. The fact that it contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is incredible. It was an accident, and look where it drove them. These two brothers make me want to be there to help.
