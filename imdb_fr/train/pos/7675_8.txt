After watching the film last night, I ended up with the feeling of desperation that organizations face as they try to solve the problem described in the film. The scale of prostitution seems so great that it is difficult to see how it can be overcome without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the review continues. <br /> <br /> is a dark film with an uncomfortable central relationship it is a very convincing film, and I would go so far as to say that it was nice. The film was well set for the duration and the performance of Thuy Nguyen was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston had played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice to understand a little more why Patrick thinks he should help Holly, but maybe the reason is so simple explains to Chris Penn's character. I will not explain it here - go see the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good film that inspires reflection and whose intentions are obviously good. I hope the publication will be broad enough to reach a decent size audience and gain more support for the K-11 project.
