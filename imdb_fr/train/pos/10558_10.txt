<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made strange metaphysical anguish popular, but this Canadian jewel makes it hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like most strange movies, the less we talk about plot, the better, but let's put the two friends together, Anthony and Dave are together since childhood, they can not cope with world and ultimately it means they no longer have to. But that's where even more problems begin. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile long after the final credits. It's a rare experience with so many pieces of "nothing" mass produced. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
