Shining film, the next best film of The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS and I have not seen this movie for 15 years but it is still as good as it was at the time. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse, but it's these features that make this movie awesome (and many other Chinese kung-fu movies). The choreography is great and the scenario is basic. I've never seen Shaolin's 36th room, but I know it's the same movie but Gordon Liu plays San Te but San Te in Thr Return To The 36th Chamber is played by a different character. He has a lot of comic value and a brilliant kung-fu.
