I just finished watching "Kalifornia" on SHOWTIME for the fourth time since I saw it for the first time in July 2001. One might think that with the recent wave of serial killer movies, this "Kalifornia" would be part of previous films. worthy of mention but does not have. Perhaps if this film had been broadcast between 1996 and 1999, it might have been more successful. In my opinion, "Kalifornia" is very different from most serial killer films released in the late 1990s. It has an atmosphere almost completely different from most of the current serial killer movies like "Seven" or "The Bone Collector ". Many serial killer movies have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we can never see enough to learn something about them. "Kalifornia" is a film that actually tries to break this barrier and understand the criminal spirit. It tries to answer questions such as "why are they doing what they are doing, is it because of something that has happened in the past, does it make them feel better?" Or are they doing it because they like the thrill? "These are some of the things that" Kalifornia "tries to answer but also gives us the opportunity to try to solve the problem ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an eternal impression as Early Grayce. When we meet for the first time At the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously a disturbed individual. When we see it for the first time, it's late at night. Early, it may be drunk. We then see him picking up a rock, throwing it off a bridge, and this one lands later on the windshield of a passing car. Pitt is fierce in this movie. It is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people. It's funny that this will lead him later to play a real dive like in "12 Monkeys" and that he is at the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher's "Seven".
