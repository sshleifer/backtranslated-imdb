Grand Canyon is part of a very rare category: it's a very intelligent film, with very intelligent dialogues and food for thought from start to finish. I have the impression that it has never been ranked as it deserved (and never will be) because of its simplicity. This kind of film needs sensitive observers. Too bad that IMDb forces me to write ten lines, because this is not necessary in this particular case. Anyway, to answer this request, I will tell you that the weak point of the film, if any, is the role played: it is not bad, but it could have been much better done. An exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect. Go ahead and watch it.
