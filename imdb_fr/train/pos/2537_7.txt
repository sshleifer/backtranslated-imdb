Boris and Bela are doing well together in this film, whether they are against each other or that they are paddling on the same boat. I saw this one in 1972 and I bought it at Borders this year. This time looking at him with my children, I took note of 2 things: He was holding the attention of a child of 3, 4 and 5 years old; and I caught a few things that I had not seen the first time I looked at them. Very fast story with an unpredictable end. A must for movie lovers !!!
