Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the main character of this fun little gothic nail. She accepts the position of secretary of a dowager of London society (incarnated by Dame May Witty) and her terrifying son (George Macready, erased and embarrassing). Before she knows it, she wakes up to find herself in a seaside mansion she's never seen before, where Witty and Macready call her Marian and try to convince the servants and the townspeople close that she is the crazy wife of Macready. Of course, this couple can only plan despicable actions, and even if we know that Julia must finally escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis arouses a real suspense by answering the question of how she will handle this. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" has nothing stylistic to distinguish many films released at the same time, but I was surprised at the quality of its maintenance despite its budget chain and his pedigree of B-movie. There are quite a few moments when you may be on the edge of your seat and I found myself really passionate about Julia as she grabbed the stratagem and began to thwart her captors. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would have fainted, screamed and shook, waiting for her hero to come and save her. So I can not tell you how refreshing it was to let the heroine of this movie use her brain and find a way to escape. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Note: B +
