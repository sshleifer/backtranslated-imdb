It took me a long time to find the title in a special video library in Berlin and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think it's one of the best horrormovies of all time. It seems strange to me that some people describe this film as black comedy. I must admit that I was not able to laugh when I first saw it (and it was the same with the second time!) Trelkovski seems so nice and even so cute in his shyness, but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that. But what matters most is of course his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he really is. His halluzinations are the most terrifying of this film. Of course, everything is in his head, but is this apartment that brings out its feminine side or was it also before his arrival? I think it's an interesting question. His shizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is horrible to see both sides or identities fighting. The result is that he cuts his hand first, then jumps out the window. But this terrible cry - does that mean that everyone will repeat themselves over and over again ... that his soul is in a cage or something like that? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian stuff? The fact that he / she looks like a mom at the hospital - it's not an incident, but a clue from my point of view.
