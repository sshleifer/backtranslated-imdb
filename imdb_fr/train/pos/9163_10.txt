When my university-aged daughter was in preschool age, this mini-series appeared on A & E from 8 to 9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we would not miss Jane Eyre for a minute and our kids were late in kindergarten every morning all week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I forgot how much I loved this movie until I recently released my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but remains perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the compelling behavior imbued with humor and tenderness were straight out of the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little landscape, I could not sit through an adaptation starring William Hurt or the grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic lies in the fact that women love Dalton and soak up this romance. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She died like Jane, silent, formal, saying volumes with only a look. The brilliance of her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spiritual nature that helped Jane survive the abuse she suffered in her youth. Criticism of his performance as "wood" is misplaced. A servant in a real English household would have maintained such behavior, but she speaks with passion when she is moved. Unlike many other Janes films, she appears simple enough to be Jane and pretty enough to allow the public to buy the Rochester attraction for her. <br /> <br /> Bronte's dialogue largely explains why the book resists the script. of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interaction between Jane and Rochester with intelligence and intensity. Although Jane seems as simple and sweet as vanilla pastry cream, she refuses to be intimidated by Rochester's dark and powerful bluff. Both heads play beautifully. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romantic novel of all time.
