I must say that Grand Canyon is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. I have looked at it several times now and I still feel the same as the first time; that this film, alone, could constitute the whole program of a postgraduate course in realization. <br /> <br /> A long time ago movie trailers used to promise, "It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry." It's a very banal and succinct way to describe what Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places in the human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is punctuated by the comings and goings between people close to happiness and the same people close to horror. It's always a short step, too. Wanting to manage this swing gracefully and without giving it a false or exaggerated appearance is the genius of management. <br /> <br /> A spoiler to come. After having accustomed the audience to swing in the spectrum of emotions, the film describes a sequence with a sequence that does not go from good to bad but degenerates into an ordinary marathoner, through an accidentally self-inflicted knife. injury that may or may not require stitches, to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house. At the moment of their relief, forgotten argument, finger cut off forgotten, the earthquake having survived, a neighbor says that her old husband collapsed. The couple rushes to his rescue. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw him. I'm crying now. It's not the sadness that does this to me. This is not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me apart is that these few minutes of film were PERFECT. It's perfect! Amazing. (spoiler end) <br /> <br /> There is so much to say about the Grand Canyon. It portrays relatively ordinary people experimenting with epiphanies and allows the viewer to experiment with them by proxy. They are neither clairvoyant nor exaggerated and there is no long pause to examine the moment carefully. The film advances to the rhythm of life. Even when the characters try to understand what happened, they do not know what to draw from their experience. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
