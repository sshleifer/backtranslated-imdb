this movie is just great. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. Although the film has almost nothing to do with his original film of 1932, Pacino does a great job as Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has this way of seeing where he can say anything and make it sound good. If you thought Pulp Fiction was good with big words (if you saw it), you should also see Scarface to see another angle as to how an actor can tell them. (that's quite nice) <br /> <br /> even if the movie has a lot of action and the plot evolves very quickly in time, not keeping the proper aspect ratio, it is Always easy to follow must keep your eyes open at all times so you do not lose anything. Personally, I found that watching this film made three hours seem like a breeze, it's really just great. <br /> <br /> this film is one of those films that is played and directed so that you not only forget that this film was shot in the 80s, but that you actually root the villain .. "So, good evening to the bad guy"
