I thought this movie was very well done, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also very good and credible. I do not know how true it is, but it showed why people sometimes became what they did. Maybe people in positions of authority have always been corrupt and I found it interesting that over 30,000 people signed a petition asking Ned Kelly NOT to be hanged, so maybe there was more of truth in this film than originally planned? In many ways, it reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical film. All in all, I would highly recommend this film and I am a little disconcerted by the fact that it did not do better in cinemas.
