Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised to find that this movie did not have ten strong, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe it's just cool not to give credit to the Titanic these days, but when it was created, it was really something. When the movie came out, people flocked to the theaters. When he came out on video, my sister and I watched him twice a day for a month. It was safe to say that we were obsessed and for good reason. Some scenes of disaster were hard to forget, like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died aboard this ship, and James Cameron took up the difficult challenge of transmitting this film with the immediacy and emotion he needed. And let's not forget the incredible love story between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was the fruit of someone's imagination, it was charming. They hardly knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. Of course, they give Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I'll never give up, Jack." Titanic is a very good movie. It's a powerful story told by brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music and a team of hard-working and dedicated workers. I'm really surprised when someone says he hates this movie.
