Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. It is striking to note that the film describes very well the original spirit, although the plot has been changed considerably. The language of the film, the rhythm, the special effects come from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese nucleus. It's amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them. The result is pure beauty.
