Well, I would consider Police Story to be one of Jackie Chan's best movies. The plot, the fight scenes and the waterfalls are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime leader was released for lack of evidence, he accused Chan of killing a police officer. For this reason, he became wanted by the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the crime chief's secretary, went to a mall and started stealing evidence from the crime lord's crimes in her computer and was preparing to send them to Chan. However, the crime leader knew that Salina had downloaded her incriminating data and hired her henchmen to capture her. Later, Chan appeared on the scene and started to fight all the henchmen, beating them one by one. In the last scene, Chan was seen hitting the crime lord. Finally, it's the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended.
