The Teta i la Luna (The breast and the moon) describes the life of a boy aged 9 to 10 named Tete, obsessed with growing breasts in Catalonia. I like this film because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters of the films of Bigas Luna (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me how life can be fascinating and exciting at this age. Being also from Catalonia (north-east of Spain), it reminded me a lot of memories. This film shows how beautiful Catalonia is, nice people, a good life and especially many people not tense.
