There is one detail, which is not very common for Jackie Chan's films, but who is here. It reigns a very hard and serious atmosphere and the amusing elements are also present. Jackie is threatening and psychotic here. It is not a hero who is attacked and only while he is fighting (in a usual casual pattern), but it is he who can leave and start the tumult. His way of hitting this bad guy in his glasses is amazing. Each time it goes "crack!" I also particularly like the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and hurts the bad guys who made the front page of his girlfriend. This is one of the best blitzkriegs on the screen. In addition, the entire scene is filmed with the background of an action character painted on the wall (it also looks like a poster of "rabochiy" from our Soviet era) and some lines in Russian on the left (I am have noticed fortuitously). It looks awesome (and nostalgic for the Russian people). I also like when the windows are broken in the movies. Here, there are a lot of these things. It's quite amazing to see the characters fall / jump / run / cross all kinds of windows. <br /> <br /> The three films are great. I had prepared to see the quality drop, but I saw a perfect trilogy with meaning and incredible stunts (and the character of Jackie Chan does not only appear in the three films - it's also excellent and maintains continuity ). <Br /> <br /> I would like to describe each film in just a few words: No.1 - awesome (in all aspects - it's a captivating story from start to finish) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous) ; No. 2 - rage (Jackie is really * beep * here) and sore (Jackie is tortured); No.3 - unbelievable (the woman who fights alongside Jackie is amazing) and bombastic (should I mention a lot of guns and explosions?). <br /> <br /> For the rest, many things have been mentioned by others. <br /> <br /> It's a trilogy that can be monitored again and again (at least by me). His place is in the top 10 action / comedy gems. Finally, it was released in Russia on DVD (the second film offers the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for your attention.
