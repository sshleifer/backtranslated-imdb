Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives an astonishing performance of declining actress, facing success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, incarnated by the specter of a girl's death. The acceptance of oneself, of the human condition, in spite of its general difficulties, is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself is disconcerting: it is as if the scene becomes an issue for the Heroine. If all American films could only be of this quality, dealing with human relations at an adult level, not seeking to infantilize and normalize their feelings ... One of the best dramas of all time. 10/10.
