An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He wanders in the woods to witness a murder but has he seen the murder or is he losing his mind? Is he just getting old? The film is great because the viewer has to make up his own mind about what's going on. There is very little dialogue in this film, but it does not need words, the whole film speaks for itself. You knew what was going on and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The other part of my job I liked, it was the plans of wood in late autumn and winter. These were pretty, but the only thing I did not like was the sight of the old man in underwear. He could tie the dress a little tighter but other than that, it was a pretty deep film.
