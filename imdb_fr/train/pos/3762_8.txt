Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves are back as the two dope of San Dimas who are sent for another trip of their life while someone of the future feels exactly the opposite of the way it was presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their trip is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends up being both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they have the chance to play against him to allow him to return and prevent two evil robots from ruining the future they were supposed to have. In addition to playing roles they have ... uh ... perfected, they also play (and revive some extra sales in the process) classic games (I even have my original Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> If I liked this film better than the original, it's because it deals with "what it could look like" instead of "what was". Without spoiling the movie, I can not give you any more information about it (I guess you just have to watch them both and decide for yourself!) 8 out of 10 stars.
