For me, cinema and games are about telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a profound tragedy that can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical story. In this film, I thought that Gregory Peck's and Susan Hayward's stories were at their best. Knowing and understanding David's story and his journey to become king of Israel made this story all the more compelling. One could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of this man who, in his day, was larger than life. The fear, the reluctance of Susan Hayward, but then the obedience to her authority while her king was beautifully portrayed by her. One could also feel David's anguish when Uria spent the night at the door rather than at home. As well as the sadness when he was killed in action. The powerful and authoritarian condemnation of the king by Raymond Massey made me feel angry. The sets were real and the atmosphere was credible. Overall, I think it was one of the best movies of its kind. I gave him a rating of ten.
