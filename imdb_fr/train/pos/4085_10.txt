If you were born around the end of the film and had an open / open minded home, I'm sure that in the early '80s you would be introduced to watching your parents watch movies for the first time. dirty or extremely dirty. movies. You know, not 100% pornographic, but rather an alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or you're delving into their collection and placing yourself in the plastic rectangle representation of such a movie in a big machine. dookie called VHS. You had to be very calm and look like a ninja, while still suffering from heart failure when loud pops of sound were emitted when you hit the tablet-like buttons for fear of being discovered. Anyway, such films have been sent to the back of your mind, waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual "art". Needless to say, this film fits the description above in "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexuality of the film but perhaps because I am insensitive, I am more disturbed by the subtleties. Did the creator speak to us at deeper levels of human charity and / or what might be considered a real abomination, interracial relationships, bed-mate, voyeurism, or could it be to act out of desperation for a social status going as far as murder, pedophilia / homosexuality, or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist women in the 18th century in France? Who can say that, but despite Borowcyzk's taste for raw, living sexuality being the "norm" for his works, I would say that this film actually speaks to the viewer at a deeper level about bestial charity. Once I learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the vertigo of the value of the shock and, therefore, it is worth checking out.
