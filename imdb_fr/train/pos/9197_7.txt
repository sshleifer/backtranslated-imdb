It is actually a small glamorous film, made with an absolutely discernable budget, with a shot on the video film. It takes a little time to warm up. The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen charm. After a few scenes, you stop to notice the annoying lines or the repeated sound of certain broadcasts. The characters all develop an offbeat charm, including "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I would hire to play a delusional psychopath. He just seems to like it so much! Really eye-catching scenes, "The Midnight Skater", fly over the campus with a black hoodie, looking around the world for a cross between Grim Reaper and scenes of zombie infestation and crazy zombies. and, say, the money surfer. These shots make the sometimes ridiculous comments of the characters on the skater almost ridiculous. The soundtrack contains some very amusing Garage-Punk tunes and its hoarse and hoarse wickedness reflects the atmosphere of the film. Thumbs up, I say.
