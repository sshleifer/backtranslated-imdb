The film was mediocre, but this TV pilot is a great springboard for what has become an ideal program for science fiction fans. The actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an interesting and intelligent script does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
