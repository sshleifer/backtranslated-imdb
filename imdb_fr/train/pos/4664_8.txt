"Hot Millions" is a delicious comedy made even better by the presence of the wonderful cast together for her. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the play on screen and who appears as the key figure of an enterprising money-changer. The film, directed by Eric Till, shows no signs of dating as terribly as some of that time. <br /> <br /> At the center of the action is a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, who, before being released from prison, sets the custodian's income tax forms, who marveled at the repayment that the government owes him. Marcus, who is a genius of numbers, sees opportunities where others could not. He starts working for a company that uses the latest computer for his accounting, but Pendleton is a resourceful man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establishes different fictitious accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus is assigned a secretary who also has an apartment in his building. Patty, inept, works as a bus fare taker who manages to ruin everything. The way she picks up a secretary's job is beyond comprehension, but things are not the same in the office when the terrifying Willard Gnatpole decides to take on her, but do not worry, Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, accomplished pianist and is a flutist and they make beautiful music together. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how Marcus was to be played and ran away with the movie. Mr. Ustinov gives an assured account of the embezzler. The excellent Maggie Smith is also at its best with her version of Patty, the lovable woman who adores Marcus and who turns out to be a genius herself when it comes to investing the money she finds in her pockets from Marcus. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as an American in charge of society. Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, the man who desires Patty, but can not convince her to return the favor. The wonderful Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith, whose identity was assumed by Marcus. Cesar Romero also appears in the role of customs inspector of the airport. <br /> <br /> "Hot Millions" will delight anyone looking for a relaxing time with Marcus Pendleton, a disreputable and charming character.
