I saw ZP when he came out for the first time and I found his major disappointment. His script seemed forced and arched and too false. It is a policy that is too straightforward and ridiculous. And let's face it, I was still under a love spell called BLOWUP: and I still have not completely shaken it. Now, "love" is twisted with all kinds of nostalgia that it evokes and, oh well. . . Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time passes and the weather has been good for ZP and the time has been for me a teacher. I revisit this film every ten years or so and it gets better and better with age. And ZP is his own "experience" and is really related to BLOWUP only through his creator, the late Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I had the good fortune to see an absolutely blank film. impression, projected to its correct size (huge), restored by a cultural agency of the Italian government who knows a good work of art when she sees it and knows the importance of the preservation of this beauty. To this day, I remember the public's breath when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand-volt visual shock that Antonioni had intentionally launched to awaken us to a new level of consciousness. And indeed, what follows is a kind of "place" quite different. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is how this movie comes into play. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time, in the early 80s, I started to feel affection for the film as a whole and for Daria and Mark in particular. While, before these two did not look like a whimsical version of Olivia and Leonard Zefferelli (read: Romeo and Juliet), they engaged me now - especially The Girl in his insistent slo-motion-ality. She took her time. . . Live. Everything, everything dies around her. <br /> <br /> In exciting theater, the light of day of reality quickly began to erase my new "pleasure". The 80s, with thick hair and padded shoulders, whispered, "But it's a hippie fantasy --- let it go" <br /> <br /> The strength of Antonioni's vision had, I had understood, already worked inside me So I answered "80s" with a "Uh-Huh" and kept my "love" secretly, possessively and jealously. <br /> <br /> But here is the good art he lives inside you and, if you wish, he has his way and you "love" in return: secretly, jealously and possessively. And you are "changed". <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see that Turner Classic Movies has decided to show ZP in its March lineup. There is no doubt that ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen to truly immerse yourself in its built environment. But, hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved on a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse. <br /> <br /> Today, ZP has been mysteriously removed from reality and replaced by the antics of ALICE'S RESTAURANT restaurant. . <br /> <br /> So it is still too "difficult", too "disturbing", also "what"? <br /> <br /> Maybe, as with any good art, he lives everything else dies around her. <br /> <br /> Peace.
