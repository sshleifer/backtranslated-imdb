SPOIL ALERT! This film, Zero Day, tells the story of two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred towards anyone and everything associated with it. <br /> <br /> They embark on a series of "Missions" Thoughts all leading to the huge mission, which is the zero day. The content at zero days is not specified until the middle of the end of the movie. The viewer knows that he is serious and full of hatred, but is never certain until the end. <br /> <br /> Now, we all know that if the film is based on the Columbine massacre, the end is pretty obvious. And the end is no different from any other movie on the attack, they will kill a lot of their comrades at the end. <br /> <br /> I have seen a lot of movies about this attack, and this movie by Far is my favorite and the most respected. It gives the viewer and the inside a look at the life of these two teenagers who hate life, and honestly, it offers the viewer an understanding and a closure on the horrible event. <br /> <br /> Events played, I never knew the gravity of the shots, until my English class was assigned an essay or story on a decisive moment of our generation. I knew everyone was going to pick the Twin Towers, but I wanted to be different, because of course the twin towers were tragic and very decisive, but I did not think it was the right choice for me because there were really had no way to report to that, I was only in Grade 3 and I had no idea what that meant. But the shots were left behind and effect. I remember interviews, views of the sky on the school, and the pain and terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This film is a fascinating, realistic masterpiece, and a horrible masterpiece I recommended it to anyone.
