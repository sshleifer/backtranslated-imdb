Finally, I could see the famous "Ice Age". Except maybe I'm not as funny as I hoped after seeing the brilliant teaser, there's no bad word to say. Of course, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production (plus, this is Fox's first attempt to make a full movie), but he's got a huge heart and on some occasions (like the look in the Manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past) I found myself on the brink of tears. But when they reunited the baby with his father, I could not hold them back. A film that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sapphires and clich√©s and manages to draw more than the best; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations I've ever seen. Great, funny characters that are growing rapidly on you (as well as great vocal talents) and many fun memorable scenes, especially from Scrat, give the movie more than good reasons to try it. In addition to the Dodo scene, which is my favorite fun scene of 2002. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not understand, but for some reason, it really seems like CG animation takes over at 'to come up . But if it just means there will be more movies like this (and who can forget about Pixar's creations), it does not really bother me, at least for the moment. 9/10
