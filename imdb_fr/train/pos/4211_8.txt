I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I must admit that the tension in this film was unmatched by most other NF era movies. I loved the way Chip would be calm for a moment, then VIOLENT the next moment. It was classic. Ah yes. Ladies, villians, cigars and rogue cops! He has everything. This film delivered me all the goods. I particularly liked the way they mixed communism in the plot, very common in this film era. Very daring since the blacklist was popular at the time. I consider this film as one of the best I've seen in the FN genre!
