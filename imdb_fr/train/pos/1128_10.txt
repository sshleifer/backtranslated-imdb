Although the recent narrative of a part of Homer's "Troy" epic with Brad Pitt has been entertaining once, "Iphigenia" with the incandescent Irene Pappas is breathtaking. Taking place in a natural setting where Greek actors speak their own language confers such authenticity. A chance encounter with this film on one of DirecTV's many movie channels has always interested me, despite my concentration problems. There is no glitter or "bling" in this film, just a fabulously rich story told impeccably by actors so real that it looks like they are spying on a real family in turmoil. I think that even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of this story. <br /> <br /> JLH
