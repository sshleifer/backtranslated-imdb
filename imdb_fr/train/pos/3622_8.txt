I knew I was going to see that when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the theme of the conservation of your dreams speaks to me. People talk about it as a children's film, but I think it's a film for the baby boomers who are reconciling with aging and disabled parents, our own mortality, our growing and leaving kids, and all the other things we had never thought of would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; it's about what your dreams mean when you have a real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher, but he makes it look good and Rachel Griffiths plays a small role as a woman in a thoughtful and layered performance. The camera work is slow and gentle. When they put together this film, they left out everything that was not necessary. Very pleasant.
