It's a great start to Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents here show that a long career awaits him. The hunt for cars and trucks is exciting for the 1937 era. This early Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. Spring Byington's performance is excellent, as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or the film rights holders, try your luck and do it on DVD. I think it would be a winner.
