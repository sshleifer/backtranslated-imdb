This film is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who love light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons, so I accept it as is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, behaves very well as a blacksmith, Hank Martin, who, by accident, is transported into another age, at the time of King Arthur. The beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking in the role of Alisande or Sandy, an object of affection for Hank although she is betrothed to the brave and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I love this episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) disguise themselves with ragged clothes and take the road with their bags back to experience the kingdom first hand. King Arthur's commentary, "I say, we're not alone", while giving a nice scratch to his dilapidated clothes, is one of those hilarious moments in the film. The portrait of William Bendix is ​​superbly ridiculous, not to mention his quaint attempts at "ye Olde English". <br /> <br /> The story is not deep but it is well done in my opinion and I appreciate it more each time I see it. It is also an excellent family entertainment. <br /> <br />
