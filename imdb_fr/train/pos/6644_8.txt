After too many years of waiting, the book "The House Next Door" of 1979, written by Anne Rivers Siddons, was finally shot. The result is a little different from the novel which, especially in the first story of the trilogy, is understandable, even unsatisfactory, as it is a TV movie, whose content is absorbing and very good, just not as impressive as Stephen's book King's Favorites and one of mine as well. <br /> <br /> With more race time and fewer constraints in the theatrical release, all the richness inherent in the original three-part story of the grim ultramodern home could have been explored and nurtured, especially the culminating revelation towards the end. <br /> <br /> Yet, all the cast succeeds well in this thoughtful story of insane malevolence. There are some useless and cheap shocks, but the atmosphere of growing fear is well developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes is an abstract painting of the house by its neighboring amateur-artist neighbor who tries to visualize his corruption on a canvas. <br /> <br /> Make sure to read the great novel.
