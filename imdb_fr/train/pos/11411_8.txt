S. Van Dine was to be a wise businessman in his dealings with Hollywood. Most studio film series were generally confined to one or two studios. But apparently, Van Dine had to sell one by one his rights on every book on Philo Vance. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and more have all released Philo Vance movies. Only Tarzan seemed better to move to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as a fashionable detective. Of course, MGM had contracted the original screen Philo at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to focus there. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is a pretty acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started big enough at the end of the silent era with What Price Glory, then with a series of movies with Victor McLaglen with their characters Flagg and Quirt. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to blend into the B-market. <br /> <br /> The murder case committed in the act involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere that reigns around the author suggests it, the mystery is in fact the link between all the murders and their accomplishment. <br /> <br /> I'll say it though. Vance has a very good chance of exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
