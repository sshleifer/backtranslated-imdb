I had seen this a long time ago, when I was younger and I never remembered the title. Until the day I went through the credits of John Candy's movie on IMDb, I noticed an entry called "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something sounded and I clicked on it, and after reading the summary of the plot, it reminded me of many memories. <br /> <br /> I discovered that he had aged well enough despite the fact that none of them meant a "big" comedy. However, it is rather nice and is a good riff for a Hitchcock formula of wrong identity and thrills around the world. <br /> <br /> The film has a host of characters, including an American couple who finds a woman's dog during her holidays in Europe and decides to return it to her for a reward - only to find her dead body at home. His arrival. From there, the plot becomes crazier and more ridiculous and they go on the run after the police consider themselves the killers. <br /> <br /> A mix of "It's Mad Mad Mad Mad" and a lighter film by Hitchcock It was directed by Eugene Levy and he was able to play some of his good friends - such that John Candy -. The film is mainly engaging because of its casting, and the end has a little fun twist that is not totally unpredictable but is also a bit unexpected.
