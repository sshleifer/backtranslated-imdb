Joel Schumacher made a big choice by choosing this casting and this scenario. The story is well written and well presented, and this brand new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. There seemed to be 6 "leads" and about half a dozen people, and by far, this is by far the best thing about the film, the fresh faces of tomorrow. It's been a long time since hollywood touched the controversial Vietnam War movies, which tell a lot about "story to tell" (as Schumacher says) and Tigerland is in this handful of great war movies. Still, it can not be called a war movie because it seemed more based on the human spirit of Bozz and others. I think anyone who just wants to see a good movie with all the special effects, but just a good drama, should go see Tigerland, obviously Best Shumachers in the last 8 years.
