A wonderful film, filled with sober performances and a lively and intelligent dialogue. However, what really distinguishes the film is that sadness is always underlying. The story is highlighted by business, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing one's job in a world where the consequences are disastrous. Above all, he was in a world that no longer existed, having been torn apart by the beginning of the Second World War. In fact, the movie is hardly a comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to comic scenes. Still, it's funny, listen to Margaret Sullivan's stern rejection of Jimmy Stewart and watch her pained expression as he responded that her comments were a remarkable blend of "poetry and meanness". It's funny, sharp and sad at the same time. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen-based comedies ever made.
