This 1939 film by director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his (literally) lawsuits and his tribulations. It is a sentimental film, reasonably well done but breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda in the role of Lincoln seems a mistake, because if the actor had the dubious qualities for the role, even with several inches of makeup and a false nose, he was too good for Honest Abe, who was famous . It's a good test of Fonda, which is nothing if not sincere, but its broadcast error puts all the film scrapped. The support cast is excellent, though, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too respectful in his treatment of Lincoln, who is portrayed as shy, but in the final scene, the film far exceeds the goals.
