I just saw Hot Millions on TCM and I completely forgot about this little gem. Ustinov creates a clever and discordant plot that cleverly takes him from scammers to the ingenious ... Well, you'll see. Maggie Smith is perfect as an embarrassing secretary / neighbor who has difficulty in a job but who has a warm and dynamic personality that is reflected in this image. It creates a beautiful representation of a warm, spiritual and real person who, in the long run ... well ... <br /> <br /> Molden and Newhart, as senior executives, take up the challenge of doing roles that could be banal and get them out in a comic life of their own. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are a pleasure to see and I know that at least in the case of Romero, Ustinov reaches out to work. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be a throw back to the era of the computer age and its problems for crooks are normal, but in reality, the characters are so captivating and so much fun to watch that the sub-plot is almost lost ... I say almost. <br /> <br /> Abandon your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the beautiful, implacable and deeply engaging depictions and intrigues of this photo.
