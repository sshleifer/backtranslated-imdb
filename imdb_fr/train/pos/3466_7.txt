it was a real pleasure of guilt ... I saw the trailer and all the advertising, so I thought, why not watch this movie in V1? and, as they said on TV, 'I can not believe I've watched all that!' Quinn and Harris were credible Beatles Boys and, although the accents are a little excessive and difficult to read from time to time, I also found the dialogue believable. the movie tackled len / mc's tenuous relationship and showed how deep down inside he was just two guys who grew up close and shared a passion for music, but with different personal problems and needs. you find yourself wishing that they get in the taxi for an impromptu meeting that would have upset the world, but you'll better understand why they did not do it.
