This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like in this piece of "Guilty Pleasure". It's easy to condemn this film for not including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick had long since passed their roles! The weather is only for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who took over her role as Lili, pushed the Big 6-0 (although she still looked good and she was still the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Yvonne De Carlo did not have a bigger share. It was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! In the two seasons THE MUNSTERS was in prime time, it was Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made the series such a success. The rest of the cast supported cast members, not to mention they were not needed. They were! The TV series would not have survived as long as it remained without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice over Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not live up to the original TV series, it still behaves very well and is one of the best TV shows "reunuin" that has affected the tube of in the late 1970s and early 1980s. <br /> <br /> '
