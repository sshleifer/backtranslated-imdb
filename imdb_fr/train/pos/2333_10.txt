I recently started watching this show and I must say that it really made me laugh. You must appreciate the unrealistic aspects, as well as everything else. Some other people said that this show should have among other things more realistic reactions of the dead. If you're going to accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept the other crazy pieces in the series. I could not help but smile after every episode I watched. I really think it's great that there is a series that can deal with a very strange subject and make it enjoyable to watch. I love narration, I think it adds a little more wonder to the whole show. We can not always compare the old series of an author to his news, we must take everything as his own entity. Give it a chance and enjoy the silly parts as they are.
