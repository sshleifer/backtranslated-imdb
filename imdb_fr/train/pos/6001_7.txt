This is certainly not a masterpiece and far from the best of Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has a lot to do. The places and the beautiful cinematography in technicolor bring us back to a bygone era. Errol Flynn shows moments of his past glory, and is well, because Jim Brennan, a pilot whose past comes back to haunt him. The photo is actually a remake of "Singapore" of 1947, and the story seems terribly artificial and clich√©d by current standards. In addition, many secondary actors simply seem to "follow the movements" on this image. Many people have also compared it to one of the largest, CASABLANCA. Looking at the movie, I could see a lot of similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take that for what it's worth. In closing, if you're a fan of Flynn, or old love stories, you might want to take a look at this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or the Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some Hollywood classics ...
