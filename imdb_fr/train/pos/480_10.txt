The main aspect of this film, which most people miss, is that Luhzin lives his life like a chess game. So many people have seen this film and do not get it, and I do not understand why. Watching this movie, I was taken on a private trip that knocked me down. I will try to explain this without problem, but be forewarned, I'm talking about things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Spoilers possible **** Be warned! **** <br /> <br /> He has a life of "big movements" as opposed to "small movements". He chooses Natalia to be his queen and he behaves like his aunt. He describes for the first time the King and Queen and their actions when he initiates him to chess as a boy. Listen carefully to this description. <br /> <br /> When a person asks him a question, he goes back and forth as if he were looking at the past movements. (The flashbacks are well lit, by the way.) The flashbacks are just as interesting, because they give not only his point of view as a child, but also that of the other character. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> Various characters become either his assistants, his enemies, his pawns, his bishops and his knights. Their actions will enlighten you on their side. Even their placement in a scene is essential to understand what is happening. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment further on what happens to the character of Luhzin, but I hope it will shed light on what is really happening in the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly working on many levels, so I approve of it. It was a treat and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only difference between these films is the use of chess and the treatment of characters as pieces. <br /> <br />
