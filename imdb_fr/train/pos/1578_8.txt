Rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity. The Reichdeutch women discover that their Jewish husbands have been locked up pending their deportation. An aristocrat repudiated by his family, Lena Fischer, is among the crowd, as is the sister of General Gudarian. But rank and privileges do not deserve any special consideration. <br /> <br /> Service to the Reich as a prisoner whose husband is on the Eastern Front will not learn either. In one of the most horrific scenes of the film, the guards take the wedding ring offered by her husband, a soldier. <br /> <br /> Lest you think this is the typical German brutality we have in America today, Lady Bush imperiously orders the arrest of Gold Star Mothers (mothers of American servicemen killed in action) ) because their very presence is shocking. Unfortunately, little has changed in the last 60 years, from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Ruth, her eight-year-old daughter, escapes capture. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold of Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is initially reluctant to welcome Ruth, who reacts in a typically German way. Even Lena Fisher's brother, Col. Arthur von Eschenbach, informed and opposed to the Holocost, warns Lena against her. but Lena chose to adhere to the idea with American rebellion, even renaming Ruth, the more Aryan name Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends favorably on Rosenstrasse but Lena is crying: what happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter Hannah searches for her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Lena on the pretext of writing a personal story of the war. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that Hannah wants so much to look for the family but never checks the fate of her grandfather known to have served on the front of the Ost.
