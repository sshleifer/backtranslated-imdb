I always enjoy seeing films that make you think and not just convey the answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of those films, and although many critics said it was hard to follow, with a little concentration and an open mind, I understood it. First time. Admittedly, this does not compare to other fools like "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", but in itself a clever and stimulating film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is its beauty. Every scene, every camera angle seems to have been thought for centuries. If you see it, you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> So to conclude ... look at it with an open mind and enjoy it. Otherwise, no one has ever said that "Revolver" was for everyone. And these are my 2 cents.
