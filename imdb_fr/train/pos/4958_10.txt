Complete Disclosure: I am a cynic. I like my sad ends and my dry handkerchiefs. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was touched. Will Smith's new film, Happiness, looks like a desperate call to an Oscar. Basically, I was born without the soul of an artist. <br /> <br /> So why did I like "10 items or less?" It may have been the double espresso I swallowed before the show. Or (more likely) maybe even the toughest movie buffs could use an occasional gentle touch. <br /> <br /> And that's nice. From the moment "He" meets "Scarlet" (a distant event of a Nora Ephron "meet cute"), the view is taken in an intimate journey with two strangers who learn to care about the direction of their lives . (Beautifully aided by Phedon Papamichael's movie-style camera work.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about the film is that it is too pushy. Is the film far-fetched? I do not know. You tell me. I have not met Adrian Brody yet at the market. (However, not for want of trying). Do I enjoy the adventures that could happen if this memorable event took place? Damn it, I'm doing it. . This is where most reviews of "10 articles or less" are insufficient. . . They do not take into account that even we cynics have fantasies. And heck, sometimes it's worth the price of entry to live vicariously, 82 minutes at a time.
