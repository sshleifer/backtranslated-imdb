1958. The sleepy little town south of Clarksburg. The bad sheriff Roy Childress (the all-powerful Vic Morrow in his vilest form) represses the speeders very hard by forcing the said criminals on the edge of a cliff to premature death on a particularly dangerous stretch of road. Childress meets his match when young cool hot rod driver Michael McCord (a splendidly smooth and dark performance of Martin Sheen) shows up in town in his drunk car with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother ( the brother or sister of Sheen) Joe Estevez in a brief cameo). The director Richard T. Heffron, who works from a complex and intriguing scenario of Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the gems of the film in the 70s "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line" ), tells the captivating story with a vivid rhythm, creates a tasty 1950s backdrop and exploits with great suspense the intense interplay of spirit and will between Childress and McCord. The uniformly fine distribution helps a lot: Sheen has a rebellious James Deanesque atmosphere in mind, Morrow makes the most of his fleshy role as a villain, in addition to the excellent performance of Michelle Phillips as a waitress at Maggie's restaurant, Stuart Margolin in as a popular MP, Nick Nolte as a friendly attendant at the Buzz Stafford gas station, Gary Morgan as Buzz's younger brother, Gawky, Janie Baldwin in Saffy's sassy pie, Britt Leach as a taxi driver endorsing Johnny and Frederic Downs as severe judge Judge Hooker. The vehicular confrontation between Childress and McCord is a real thrilling doozy. The sharp cinematography of Terry K. Meade, his well-drawn characters (for example, Childress became obsessed with speeding after his wife and child were killed in a fatal incident), the rhythmic and syncopated score of Luchi De Jesus and the beautiful mountainside landscapes further enhance the overall sound quality of this exceptional product, designed for television.
