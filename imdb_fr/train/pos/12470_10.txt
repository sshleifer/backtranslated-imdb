I just saw this movie on television .. <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young and this movie surely touched me .. <br /> <br /> I can feel the lost who the little girl Desi felt .. <br /> <br /> the feeling of wanting to see her father again .. <br /> <br /> want to talk to her .. <br /> <br /> or at least given the chance to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> and I am so touched by the letter that was written to him .. <br /> <br /> saying that his father read his letter, and sent it back to someone to answer him and buy him a gift because there is no store in paradise .. <br /> <br /> it just allows me to think that miracles exist. .
