I watched this last night after not having seen it for several years. It's really a funny little movie, with a crowd of unknown faces. Arkin shines as always. Check it out; you will not be disappointed. By the way, it has just been released on DVD and unlike its packaging, it is big screen. The transfer is rather mediocre, but at least the WHOLE film is visible. ;-)
