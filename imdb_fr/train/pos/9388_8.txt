Cage and Hopper met and, thankfully, not in a Lynch movie, because RED ROCK WEST is way better than any Lynch movie. Nicolas Cage is a third-class actor, the porcelain girl is a femme fatale and substitute, only daddy Hopper is as mean as ever. RED ROCK WEST is, despite the banal cast, one of my favorite American thrillers; in a word, a thriller with some twists. <br /> <br /> We mainly notice the good looks, the impressive rhythm, the thrills, the pleasant suspense, the pretty little tight ass of Lara Flynn Boyle, the enviable physical shape of Cage (although undeniably ugly, with sharp bird traits, thick eyebrows and thin, rare hair, Cage displayed a fine general shape ??), Hopper's consumed routine, some moderately but really fun moments, the Cage game with his intended character, the Hopper's rigid and psychopathic look, Lara's wickedness, Cage seems to be a wanderer, the archetype of the dark cinema of the black, hungry, leathery if need be, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle presents herself as the coldest seductress, Walsh as her heartless husband and Hopper as the lynchian hit that he has already practiced before. <br /> <br /> Cage actually looks rather stunned, dazed or very confused. severe hangover. But that could be his usual look.
