Terry Gilliam went again in the future (he had already done so in Brazil) to tell the story of a virus that destroys the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is totally crazy with some simple tricks but it's quite fun and Gilliam proves he has imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). As for casting, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (what's happened to him?) Are fine, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, every time he plays roles that escape him, it results in a result so forced and he is not credible in the cinema. all. He should simply play with handsome young men who have succeeded. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
