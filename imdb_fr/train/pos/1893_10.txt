While it is certainly politically incorrect to be distracted by a drunk, Dudley Moore's adorable lush portrait is so appealing that one can not help but think of Arthur Bach for this unique and wonderful character. How can you not be entertained by this contagious laugh, this laughter and this foolishness? Although I'm not really a fan of Liza Minnelli, she was really excellent as Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone else in this role. Sir John Gielgud was at the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also excellent and this excellent piece "Arthur's Theme", wow. It was really one of the best comedies of the 1980s. The big movies get better with each viewing and this is the case with "Arthur".
