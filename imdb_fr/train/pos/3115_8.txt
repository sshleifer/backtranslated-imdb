"The Bourne Ultimatum" is a breathtaking action movie, virtuoso and superb. <br /> <br /> Second, this is a silly malarky of cartoon superheroes. Third, the film has a complex and important point: that crime fighters turn themselves into criminals. Abu Ghraib and the scandalous national assaults of executive power against executive law are not necessary. <br /> <br /> Thus, the latest in the series "Bourne", in the hands of Paul Greengrass (from the 2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and "United 93" of last year) is an important achievement, can to be delayed but not mitigated by the inevitable excesses of the genre. <br /> <br /> "Breathtaking" described above both a complementary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for over an hour from the first image, the viewer apparently retains his breath, pushed back against the chair by the force of a merciless action, globe-trotting, quite suspensive. There is no pause, no variation in the pace and attraction of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and boring as some similar music videos do after only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood Closed-face cinematography makes the most of Tony Ludroy's script from Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (which does not fit very well with "Bourne Identity", written a decade earlier) ). <br /> <br /> Matt Damon has once again experienced the inevitable and irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest of the CIA's fantasy agents, this time taking the entire agency in search of its identity, its past and from the mysterious agency program that turned it into a killing machine. David Strathairn, the ever-marvelous hero of the highest office, stood up against Bourne in an attempt to hide some illegal policies of "taking not to take prisoners" and brutal procedures. <br /> <br>. "/> Joan Allen plays what seems to be the good cop against Strathairn's villain, and there's Julia Stiles as an agent coming to the rescue of Bourne again, a combination of Greengrass management and Stiles' stage produces a surprising impact due to a mostly silent character, his lack of communication and his more intriguing expression than miles of dialogue. <br /> <br /> The "Ultimate of Bourne" is so good that he gets away with it, with ridiculous excesses while Bourne defies the constraints of geography, time, gravity ... and physics in general. (Can you fly in back with a car from the top of a building? Why not - it looks great. <br /> <br /> All this magic of the "real world" - jumping from country to country in seconds, for to arrive at an unfamiliar place exactly as, when and how you want it - exceeds the improbabilities of animated effects and superheroes. And yet, only a clueless pedant would allow "facts" to interfere with ecstasy based on Bourne fantasy entertainment.
