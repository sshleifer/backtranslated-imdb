IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that challenges the greatest and deepest scientific minds of the 20th century to serve Cupid. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this film, which is both light and thoughtful. You do not know how to react because you sometimes see great scientists doing stupid things to feed a budding love, but at other times you hear them discussing some of the deepest space / time enigmas of our time. time. The end result is a fun movie with surprises. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates an offbeat and offbeat mathematician, and Tim Robbins sheds light on the contradictions of a poorly educated and fascinated laborer of science. All together, they create a ridiculous journey through love and science, mind and heart.
