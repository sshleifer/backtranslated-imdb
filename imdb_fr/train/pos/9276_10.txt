The US State Department would not want us to see this movie because they have close ties to the Iranian government. However, this shows how civilized Iran is despite the content of the film, focused on women's struggle for equal rights in the simplest terms: the possibility of watching a football match at the stadium, which is strictly limited to the male audience only. The film is hilarious funny and is in itself a proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I really enjoyed this film. Five girls try to cross the border from the police at the entrance of a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The comedy that follows is too much fun to describe, from the bus ride to the stadium, through police intervention and detention of girls, to the end that results. Do not miss this classic movie. It is to see absolutely. One of the best foreign movies I've seen in years.
