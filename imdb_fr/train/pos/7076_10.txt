A very strong film. Bruce is good and Brad too. <br /> <br /> As I think there are two cities left on the list of receptionists on the list Bruce remembers. <br /> <br /> This means that the woman was a real insurance and she did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, Novikov's property seems to me to work in this movie. However, I firmly believe in the theory of the multiplicity of worlds "Back to the future". <br /> <br /> So, Bruce could save the world, but not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds man can meet. <br /> <br /> And I think there is no problem with that. Here, I do not agree with Dr. Brown from Back ... <br /> <br /> But the story of 12 monkeys has its own beauty. In spite of all these theories about one world or many, or the continuum, one can believe that he is really crazy and the doctor - his girlfriend had just disappeared. <br /> <br /> A series of events that might make her believe is the future. The ball - good, it could be a mistake, a falsification. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie - have to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Best.
