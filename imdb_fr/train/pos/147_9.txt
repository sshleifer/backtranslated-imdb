The stories in this video are very entertaining and worth the detour! The first concerns a young couple being harassed in the woods by two rednecks, with one end, but unexplained in the end. <br /> <br /> The second is the best of the lot, and alone, it is worth watching - A man is attacked by a dog, he fears to be enraged - He finds refuge in what seems to be a hospital, but he discovers that the employees present are not exactly what they seem to be ...... Awesome Twist in the end, and this episode alone marks 10/10! If the others were up to this one, it would give 10/10! <br /> <br /> The third is the weakest in the pack - A girl meets guys and has wild sex! The story does not seem to interest until the end, with a good little twist, but it is ruined by the terrible first part! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's a fantastic movie that will not do the trick. you are wrong at all! Well worth a rental!
