I watch the series back to back as fast as possible. I try to watch everything about Star Trek. This is month 3 and I am now on TNG season 3 and I have already gone through DS9 in full. Star Trek is the biggest TV phenomenon ever made. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first episode of the TNG series. Having just watched the shows, these clips came back to my mind, but I noticed how some of them had been filmed again because the film looked better. Season 1 always seemed very dark and ugly - and the actors looked stupid, as if they were not part of their skin. <br /> <br /> The show is essentially made up of the biggest hits of the happiest and the saddest moments in Riker's life on the company until this point. The Data and Riker scene in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite is when the 2nd officer of the ship Klingon challenges the authority of Riker as the first officer and Riker beats the alive CRAP of this Klingon. Then the admiral kicks him but hey. All this episode is a horrible reminder that LOTS of crazy and fantastic things have already happened in just 2 seasons, there are still 5 and a small number of movies! At this point in the series, they really begin to develop the emotions that unite Riker with Deanna Troi as Imzadi. So far, they have mentioned the fact, but they have not yet exploited it. Let us leave for the record that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha asserts that Imzadi means "first" and indicates that she has had intimate relations with Riker and that she also remains very close from an emotional point of view. This episode also proves that there will be a strong romantic interest for each other for a long time. <br /> <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi At this stage of the series, the value of production is at the rendezvous and Star Trek TNG moved into the science fiction giant she was destined to become. Looking at this again as an adult, I now see what the Star Trek Universe Great Actors provide. They really need to create a new ST set after all the current shows. A DS9 movie would have been good too.
