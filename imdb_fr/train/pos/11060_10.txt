This film is beautiful. The writing, the staging, the acting are all fantastic. Very spiritual and intelligent script. Quality performance by the actors, Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and deliciously offbeat. Really original and unpredictable. The scenes are full of new energy and really talented production.
