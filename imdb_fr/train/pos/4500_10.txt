Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be close to his father. Along the way, he falls in love with Anna, a 20-year-old senior, who happens to be the wife of his new boss, Richard Crane. Despite the warnings of his new colleagues, Owen tries to get Anna, even sabotage Anna and the marriage of Richard cheating. It's a romantic drama with lots of humorous nuances and a quick wit. The actors are superb: Green of "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" convent on the screen as Owen, cunning but warm; Annis of "Dune" is very popular and goes well with Green; Kitchen, from "To Play The King" is the good threat for Richard, whose comic errors and snobbery underscore his mastery and hatred for Owen. It's a perfect love triangle, and despite the weaknesses and falsities of our three characters, you better get to know them and watch them.
