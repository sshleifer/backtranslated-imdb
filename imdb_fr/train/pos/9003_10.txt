<br /> <br /> I guess it's not the best movie of all time, but I still voted with 10 stars. Mainly because of my feelings in the end. Everyone around me and I were just touched. It's something you do not feel often. We all start to be a bit cynical and get tired of sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern movies. The film's story centers on Jane, a young woman in the last stages of MND, and the friendship between herself and Richard, a man on the verge of breaking up. It could so easily have been a dull and dignified piece, but it is so humorous, human and devoid of sentimentality that it wins you completely and against all odds is a film that feels good. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is superb, especially the latter who is always credible and strong in his role. The chemistry between the two also raises the film. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards' masterpiece, a jet-engine made of junk and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for Richards and Janes to live their lives fully so that one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and fun movie that I would recommend to everyone. do not let the subject discourage you.
