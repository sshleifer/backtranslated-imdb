It's not great, revolutionary or innovative, but "Dog Days" is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study. It's as if CRASH had taken a bad dose of heroin, but not really. This is an Austrian film that follows the lives of many depressed, disturbed and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other. It's annoying, but still very well played and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things of these characters. Certainly not for weak hearts, this very pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation in the end, we only see the life of these sordid individuals for two days. Category B
