The Sopranos are arguably the biggest show in the history of Dramatic Television. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of another series as proud of its intelligence, its sublime writing or its first-rate performances. <br /> <br /> epic reach, it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant high quality level. Centered on the life of a Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and the nuclear family of two children, the other is a big mafia gang in New Jersey, of which he is the boss. Played by James Gandolfini, True Romance and The Fame Mexican, Tony is a fascinating guy, scary but also likeable. We must congratulate Gandolfini for making an aggressive and frightening brute a truly identifiable and perfect leader. Contemporary American drama has never had a figure as striking and iconic as Tony. <br /> <br /> The distribution of hundreds of films never boasts of a flat performance. Characters as remarkable as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will remain forever etched in your memory. . <br /> <br /> However, the true genius of this story lies in the courage and bravery of the creator and writers, who are revolutionizing a classic drama series. Dream sequences of twenty minutes, a powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and scenes of violence really shocking. Yet, all of this style is touched by really touching themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never becomes cold or free. <br /> <br /> With a television now competitive and often poor, the Sopranos are on top of each other as the most original and convincing drama of the United States. Forget the redefined family. It's the redefined television.
