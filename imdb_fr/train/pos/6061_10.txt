I liked it so much that I watched it twice and it's something to say about a documentary. The score, the cinematography and the sound are absolutely breathtaking, as one would expect from an Imax production. Even if it was shot for these huge Imax theaters, it looks wonderful and sounds great at home. In fact, it would make a perfect DVD for demonstrating your system. <br /> <br /> The subject is also fascinating. This is Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario, because it is the best race car in history, since he is the only one to have won the titles of CART Championship, F1, Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. The scenario follows the path of two very important cars. the father and the son. The first car is found in a henhouse and proves to be the first roadster Mario has ever driven. We follow the restoration work to perfection. The other car is Michael's new race car and we have followed it since the beginning of the season. Imax lends the magic necessary to make automotive construction entertaining and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti's team at the time of the making of the film, tells the film. His anecdotes and his artistic spirit, derived from many years as owner and driver, lent a lot to the production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the race scene. Increase the volume here! There is something about riding at over 200 km / h and the music score that totally draws you to the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magic element is the humanity of the Andretti family. Mario Andretti, the god of the racing world, loves his father, who proudly watches over his son's career. They work so well together that every father and son should see him. You can tell they are a close family. I wish we could all have this experience.
