It's a movie above Jackie Chan's average, because of its fantastic finale and extraordinary humor, but that's nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool and the movie is entertaining, and Jackie Chan is just amazing! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan have great chemistry together and are very funny !, And I thought the main opponent looked really threatening !, but the dubbing was just terrible! Character development is above average for this kind of thing !, And the main fight is just fantastic!, Plus some of the moguls that Jackie takes in this one are hard! There is a lot of really ridiculous and crazy humor in all this, but it amuses me a lot and the end is hilarious! Plus all the characters are very nice. It's pretty cheap but generally very well done, and although it does not have the number of fights you'd expect from a Jackie Chan movie, it's enough for you to watch, and one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), play with a rifle and he goes away! This is a movie above the Jackie Chan average, because of the fantastic finale and the good mood, even if it is not great, it is still worth watching. The direction is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with a solid camera work, fantastic angles and a very fast movie. The game is very good! Jackie Chan is amazing as always, and here he is extremely likeable, hilarious, as usual in some zany stunts, has a fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked in the ass and played this gorgeous arrogant character, he was amazing! I just wanted them to stop doubling it !. (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I really like him a lot, he's also a very good martial artist. The rest of the cast is OK, I guess. Overall, it's worth a look! *** out of 5
