Ok, so the plot is on a fragile ground. Yes, all right, so there are sequences of songs and / or dances inserted at random (for example: Adam's concert and Henry's actor's act on stage). And Leslie Caron can not really, uh, you know ... act. <br /> <br /> But anyway, "An American in Paris" manages to get through all this as a refined and first-rate musical ... largely based on the incredible talent of choreography and Gene Kelly's dance, and loads of charms he seems to import into each scene with Caron. (He has to do it because she seems to have a ... emotional problem.) <br /> <br /> The most successful and technically impressive number in this musical is obviously the ballet of 16 minutes ending at the end of the film. It's incredibly filmed and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number should be Kelly's character singing "I Got Rhythm" with a group of French school children, then breaking into a range of American dances. It just proves that you do not need special effects when you have real * talent *. <br /> <br /> Not at the 'classic' level with 'Singin' In The Rain ', but pretty high up there anyway. It's worth checking out!
