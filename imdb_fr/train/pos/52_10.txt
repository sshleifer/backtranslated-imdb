This film is amazing. If you have the chance, look at it. Although, a warning, you will cry your eyes. Yes, every time I see it, I own it and have watched it many times. The performances are exceptional. It deals with darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you've seen it, notice the interesting use of shadows and light. Home Room is a phenomenal film, and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of its excellent acting, its incredible storyline and its heartbreaking dialogue. Very tense, very moving. Do not give all the answers, but advance a lot of good points about humanity
