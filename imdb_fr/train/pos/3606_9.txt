I really enjoyed Girl Fight. It's something I could watch over and over again. The acting was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. Very convincing I could say. The film shows how women should defend what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time. Dealing with an ignorant father did not really help her much. Even if he loved her, he was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger and it also put a little sadness in the role. The love story was a part that I really enjoyed in the movie. I felt the passion they had for each other. Then again the drama sets in and it's as if she chooses between her boyfriend and her dream. I thought it ended just right. This is the kind of end where you have to decide what happened in the future for them. For anyone who loves a sports-based movie with a good plot, I suggest you watch this one
