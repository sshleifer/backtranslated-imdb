Crush combines drama, humor and such irony that the English are very good when it comes to heart problems. Best known for leading John McKay, he wrote this beautiful scenario about three friends in his forties in a small town in England. The three women professionals, unlucky with the men, formed a ritual gathering ladies with a supply of gin, swatters and treats, as well as endless discussions about the erroneous behavior of their appointments or the needs of their libido. Andie MacDowell, once again thrown by the British (that's where I think she breathes the most), is absolutely charming as the director of a prestigious school that gets involved with a young man. The gossip of a small town and the jealous disapproving friends (large secondary distribution) are in conflict with his relationship. Deploy a series of brutal and unhappy events and show us the many difficulties in finding true happiness. Keep in mind the basic premise of this film is friendship and the end shows us exactly that. This is the type of movie you like or hate, which is why I think the number of mix reviews and success have not been as great at the release of this movie. I'm sure most are just discovering the movie now. I really liked this movie and would highly recommend it to movies like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a Funeral". Not to mention that the soundtrack is extraordinary, perfectly capturing these crucial moments.
