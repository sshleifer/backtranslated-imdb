Old People Show ???? I'm 15 years old and I watch the show since I was 12, I recorded it every day on my Sky + box from Hallmark and the BBC 1. I really wish they'd do not cancel, they have not even had a real goodbye. But what an adventure, all these episodes, I think I have seen them all, and no one comes to my mind that I have neither loved nor appreciated. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that the BBC switches between Assassination Diagnostics and 'Assassination Writes' - I have never watched it and I do not intend to do it. Anyway, the Murder Diagnostics characters are so deep and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. It was really a sad day when they canceled this show ........
