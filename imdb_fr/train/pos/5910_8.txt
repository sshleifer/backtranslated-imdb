OK, OK, do not be discouraged. I was joking. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is actually a better and more true title anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Racist and criminal dramas get the satirical treatment wanted by our friend host X-rated Ralphie Boy. And he's doing one of his best jobs here. <br /> <br /> On the crime front, it shows the truth. They build it, defend it, then boredom, and stronger rivals make it (perhaps) lose it. See for yourself what's going on. <br /> <br /> Racist? I do not know. Scatman (RIP) and Morse Lover (also RIP) being black and the main point of view, I saw it primarily as an attack on racism. The fact that Richard Pryor liked it says as much. And the youngest (before "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas had a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> This is an animated film "Blacksploitation". This is a good thing. Do well and do well. This will cause troubles (like the lynching scene), but unfortunately, this is based on facts. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie would REALLY have to rethink that title.
