Amazing effects for a movie of this era. An introduction to the futility of war and how war feeds on itself. <br /> <br /> A wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now public domain and available at archive.org. No fees, no registration required. Watch it in one sitting and you will be propelled. <br /> <br /> I intend to share this film with as many people as possible, as I have never heard of before, and I am a fan of science fiction. <I would like to see how others react to this film. <br /> <br /> Look at him. <br /> <br /> Write it down. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
