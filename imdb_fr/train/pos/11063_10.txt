I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne's "Waitress" (2007). This film only confirms what was clear in this film. Adrienne was a wonderfully talented screenwriter-director, an original and unique artist. She has managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm, optimistic and humanistic tendency. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with an extraordinary performance as a woman who has fallen on the edge. Male leader Reg Rodgers, who looks like Judd Nelson, is doing well. There is also a big cameo from Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the film "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can be considered as an optimistic eulogy: <br /> <br /> "It's a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In a sea ​​of ​​pain, <br /> <br /> No matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> You're mired by the rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not leave not the heartless Descend, <br /> <br /> Do not greet the heartless at your door, <br /> <br /> Do not live among the heartless
