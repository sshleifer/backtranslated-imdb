First of all, I think the comment below is unbecoming for a site like this. Obviously, you have no taste and you do not respect the taste of others. Not to give you a history lesson but I think that needs to be done. Black actors simply succeed, if not more, than others. If you are not part of the "black race", you can not understand the quality, creativity and vibrancy of old movies like "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Since, unfortunately, you are not Black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we look at these classics. So you have to keep your mouth fucked and stick to your non-dancing run. Thank you.
