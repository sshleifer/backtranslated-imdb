Farrah Fawcett has spent most of her post-Angel career confusing us, with an occasional noteworthy actor performance sandwiched between her Playboy antics and Letterman escapades. But basically, we can not deny that this girl can act. Far from a story with epic proportions, this well-made TV film is sweet, silent and sometimes moving. Fawcett plays the capricious girl of the black sheep who comes home only to find that she has missed the last days of her mother's life, as well as the funeral, much to the chagrin of her more stable and probably more reasonable sister. Brad Johnson plays the interest of love, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of drama drama, but there is always this Farrah that confuses to watch, and it remains, indeed, perfectly watchable. (And, yes, I admit, I had this Farrah poster on the wall a long time ago). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) at Corkymeter. Bosley would be proud.
