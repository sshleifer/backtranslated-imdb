It's a great movie for bodybuilder and female action fanatics! I think Sue Price did a great job in this movie series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be an excellent fighter. She has a very striking appearance and an iron will to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although not a high-value film and Sue Price's acting talent was not the best in my life, the film itself was something great, an invaluable gem for bodybuilder action fans! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi movies, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the goal. The fact is that A.Puyn has incorporated into this film a very talented bodybuilder who has put all his energy and talent to show us the best of what she can do. I really enjoyed this movie and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a shame it has not been shown on DVD yet :-(
