I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small cinema of 200 places at the top of the main building of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was absolutely attentive. I love the mix of superbly realized fiction scenes. It's an incredible scenography. The scenes really seem to have been shot in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so nice. <br /> <br /> I rate this experience at 9/10. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> The documentary speaks of awesome Blues men, with black and white scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. It's really unbelievable. But it also mixes new bands and maybe that's one of the things I might not like in this documentary. It is the excessive use of links with modern rock bands that play these Blues songs in a modern way. I did not really appreciate their unhinged way of playing such awesome Blues songs. It's the same kind of non-perfect musical taste that I found while watching Wim Wenders' social club Buena Vista. <br /> <br /> The documentary was such an ovation during the first screening in the small cinema that the next On that day, this documentary was presented to everyone and tourists on the beach of La Croisette at outdoor cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the poor quality of the sound are probably a difficult experience to appreciate for the thousands of people sitting in the sand that night.
