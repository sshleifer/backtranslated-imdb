What a delicious film ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by the lush, emotional and dreamy music of the composer RACHEL PORTMAN, this film remains a pure delight that deserves to be viewed more than once a year. <br /> <An incredible casting ... <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's role. Toni Collette was great like Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character who stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! She was hypnotizing to watch, we find ourselves on the edge of her seat hanging on each word and laughing hysterically WITH her. One of the most endearing characters I've met for ages. In one of the opening scenes, she thanks Mr. Woodhouse for sending "this beautiful quarter of pork ... pork, mother !!!" she shouts to her mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law), who looks distraught and has an obvious hearing impairment. She is desperate and lost. <br /> <br /> The comical ways that Emma avoids making the squeaks built by Miss Bates A truly heartbreaking scene at the picnic where Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her cruel dig into her heart. We then see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears and so crushed that one can not help feeling her heart tearing for her. It's a classic scene, to rewind and play again and again ... <br /> <br /> The end is needed with "Sense & Sensibility" and offers one of the greatest lessons of life on how to marry your best friend ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie enchants you as much as me. <br /> <br /> I loved it!
