Life in (some) colleges. Of course, artistic licenses have been taken, but some of what you saw in this film continues in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to colleges in Southern California, where the races are practically happening with theirs. It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality, and so on. and I can honestly say that it is there. But the problem is that when classes are left behind, or just waiting for the course, they (the students) seem to hang out with people of their race or ethnicity. Is it bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of belonging. But as the diary of one of the schools I attended once wrote, "we should all try to hang out with different ethnic students and try to get to know them." Otherwise, you create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly existed in one of those schools I attended. Once, someone placed leaflets on campus to talk about the glory of the Aryan race and bore the symbols of some of these racist organizations. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the film where the young white man left and started filming at a meeting on multiculturalism. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing like this will ever happen. <Br /> <br /> Is higher education too dramatic? Exaggerated? May be. Is it "off mark?" It depends on where you went or where you go to school. The race, where ethnic groups hang out with their own means, occurs. Without the Hollywood exaggerations, the race thing happened to me close to home.
