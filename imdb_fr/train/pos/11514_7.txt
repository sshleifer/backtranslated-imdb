This is not John Cleese's most successful television project, "Strange Case" gives the impression of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revision. There are idiotic ideas everywhere and even some clever ideas, but the story as a whole unfortunately does not give much to add. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is funny, however, like Dr. Watson, bionics bits and all. "Lord."
