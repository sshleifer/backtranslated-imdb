I love the TV series. Was hooked the first time I saw it. If only I were there playing with them. It's about the reality when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of your life, then you have an event that makes you meet someone else and that person is more the one with whom you want to be. You are in a situation where you have to choose one or the other. Someone will be hurt, nothing can stop him. Making the decision is difficult, but do you want to continue to be unhappy when you could have been? Why continue to live a life that you thought you wanted or think you were doing the right thing and that you both were unhappy. This other person is not going to wait a lifetime, she has a life a well. Making the decision you really want will be better in the end. To best use what you have is good. Money, cars, houses, etc. do not make you happy because you only want the one person you want to be with whom you want to share it with.
