I'm going to make it short and nice because I do not think there are many things you can really tell about this show that has never seen it, except for its funny and unique humor for me. is perhaps the most entertaining show of all time. <br /> <br /> You really have to watch it to understand his humor and it took me a few episodes to really get in but once you get in, you can not get out of it anymore. For example, the way the Hydes character always wants to see his friends embarrass themselves in a kind of trouble, the more fun it becomes, the more funny it becomes. <br /> <br /> It's a classic, I mean the cast, the writers, the director, it's just a recipe for success. Ashton Kutcher is one of the toughest actors, but I think he's awesome in this show. I do not think it's possible that Kelso's character was played by anyone else. So you need someone very smart to play someone stupid. All the main characters are great and it would not be a worthy review if I did not mention the cold fox like stone, Mila Kunis, here is a spicy encounter with a ball ha ha ha joking aside a stunning show.
