Ok, so I've come a long way from Houston, but every time I see this movie, I'm brought back to the dream of a little cowgirl to ride the bull one day at Gilley's. <br /> <br /> If you grew up in East Texas, then you know that this movie is a faithful representation of contemporary life at this time. If you did not trust me, watch the movie. Either you join all those who love it (and at the same time strangely rejected), or at the very least, you can make fun of the red neck. (There is a lot of material to have fun.) This movie does not try to be PC (what was it in the 80s) or hide the white element of the basket and it's is honest for the time and place. <br /> <br /> I have to be a 10 for me!
