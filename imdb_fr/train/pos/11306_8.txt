The catastrophe is triggered by a deplorable social situation: a poor woman, Giovanna, has ended in the bottleneck, but she always has an asset: beauty and youth. Bragana, a tenant of a service station with belly fat, who has been walking for years, comes looking for her in the street and offers her bed and house with her clumsy affection. But the physical contact that Giovanna now faces only gives her feelings of disgust and, therefore, she does not see him as a benefactor, but a tormentor from whom she must get rid. <br /> <br /> The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally gives her the long-awaited opportunity. And you do not need to ask twice: at the first meeting, she gives him the feeling of being physically wanted and a little later, she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance. <br /> <br /> Partnership development, however, must comply with the strict rules established by Giovanna. Gino's desire for freedom is removed, her desire to leave the scene with Giovanna and start a new life away from the fatso is dismissed. Giovanna has another goal: to kill Bragana, inherit and, in addition, collect the insurance premium. In his hands, Gino degenerates into a tool that sacrifices itself. Completely at the mercy of this woman, he becomes a murderer in cold blood. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanna, he questions the crime committed on the moral plane. The taking of Bragana's very place, which includes sleeping in the bed of a dead man, provokes a deep dislike of himself. And later, after learning about the next payment of insurance money and seeming to understand Giovanna's astute plan, he also proceeded to a physical separation from her lover and found solace in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <If Visconti's film ended at this stage, it could easily be classified as a condemning portrait of a cool, calculating, unscrupulous woman with a slight hint of social criticism. But then, the last sequences make collapse this construction of ideas carefully constructed. Finally, Giovanna regrets what she has done and, through the uncompromising revelation of her deepest feelings, she manages to ignite Gino's love again. His violent death by an absurd road accident does not leave him helpless in the face of an arbitrary fate. It also concerns us, as we realize that none of the characters should be held responsible for their disaster. The culprit is only the state of a society that inevitably determines the path of the individual from the beginning. <br /> <br />
