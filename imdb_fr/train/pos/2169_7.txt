OK, first, ignore the comment of the last person. They admit to falling asleep so it's no wonder they did not understand what was happening! As a thriller / horror, this film is not so bad, it is certainly very viewable. From the first scenes, you have a general idea of ​​the cause of all the madness that ensues and, in the end, you are absolutely right, everything is specified. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this experience. movie, it was pretty strange sometimes and as old movies go, it was passable. Great to watch late at night! I give it a generous 7 out of 10.
