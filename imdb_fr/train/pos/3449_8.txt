TACHIGUI: THE EXCEPTIONAL LIFE OF FAST-FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii With: Toshio Suzuki, Keno Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Ter Nada Katsuya - Ko Nachated - ----- --------------------------------- <br /> <br /> Way back in 1995 Mamoru Oshii launched his dazzling animated film Ghost In The Shell, which helped cement international acceptance of cartoons - and also immersed himself in the general concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski for The Matrix. <br /> <br /> Continuation of the film, Innocence (2004)), was the first Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and he left the head that turns so much for his style and its innovative effects only for its often unfathomable plot. <br /> <br /> Always the forerunner, Oshii introduced us to Tachigui: The amazing lives of the fast-food raiders? which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor with Japanese anime. <br /> <br /> Say hello to the "superlivemation" of Oshii's creation: not quite an animation, nor really a real action. Instead, the distribution underwent about 30,000 snapshots, which were digitally processed and reconstructed into a deceptively simple paper reminiscent of Balinese puppets. The movement itself is a stopped, stop-motion style reminiscent of Tetsuo's experimental sequences: Iron Man (1988) by Shinya Tsukamoto. <br /> <br /> "I could not think of any other method than this one," Oshii said. in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The choice of distribution is also enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic, while Studio Ghibli's acclaimed producer, Toshio Suzuki, spends his time on the screen being murdered in a weird way. Katsuya Terada, who worked with Oshii in Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi, a special effects specialist who worked on Godzilla films. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's narration sounds like a breathtaking documentary about NHK. ?? Which belies the cartoon here as well as Yamadera's long career that expresses stoic cartoon characters like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a bizarre reimagination of Japan after the Second World War in the context of various types of fast food, from soba ramen shops to gyudon bars; From American dogs in convenience store hot plates to McDonalds-inspired hamburger chain restaurants. "Food is the root of desire," said Oshii, as an explanation. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a new generation of consumers: the fast-food tenants of the title, the people who do not like to pay for their tucker and who are constantly refining their elaborate scams to score free Munchies points . <br /> <br /> Oshii said that her back-motif was a tribute to the "art" of eating food on the streets? Something still considered a little taboo in this country and that partly explains the use of the term "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> The Real Action Movie Director (Avalon, Stray Dog) Besides animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums. The celluloid result is deposited somewhere in the gray area between the two formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experience here is as exhilarating as it is exciting. Just do not ask what all this is meant to mean; Oshii's films, both cerebral and innovative, are often not very clear at the narrative level. Where Oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor ?? Here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, dead by hula-hoop, the fastest samurai burger chef in the world ?? and in the very nature of the surreal film in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a man who gives in to the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut and perhaps owes as much to Andrei Tarkovsky as to David Lynch. It is not surprising, then, that the B-52 bomber is at some point overflowing with a Yoshinoya-like franchise. The 54-year-old director and writer seemed to think this in a natural way. "The Japan I described in the film may not necessarily be true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
