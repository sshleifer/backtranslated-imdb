It's more than the charming story of a middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing (even if it is the same). It is the story of a person who is learning to love life by pushing all the pressures of work and money to find joy. The bonus of this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan towards everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact. There are scenes that will make you laugh with laughter ... some where you'll want to get up and do some tango ... and many more where you'll feel good. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent introduction to contemporary Japanese cinema for those who may feel that all Japanese films are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
