Any movie from Orson Welles' debut is a triumph to the third man with Joseph Cotton. He is also wonderful in a touch of harm. Please see them all! He tends to be pompous and selfish in movies like F is for Fake, a really stupid movie loss. Do not waste your time looking at it. it's really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone who studies cinema should see everything he has filmed. All her leaders are great but in the end, Welles became a drunkard, like her character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason, Orson Welles knew women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, nor Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on and on, but I'm moving away of the subject ... and because I am a woman, I can see the attraction for him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last real filmmakers and, unless you count the filmmakers of today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the filmmakers do not compare to the filmmakers of the Forty! I know there are many more great filmmakers today, but in such a short time I can not name them all. No offense to any of the great filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Remind me please some filmmakers in the making, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I love some of the movies, but there are few that I would put on a "Top 100" list. "Hustle and Flow" was great, as was "Fargo" and "Oh, my brother, where are you," from a line in Sullivan's travels; Another beautiful film of the forties! Can anyone give me a better list for the 90s and until 2006? I would like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also accessories for this site! Where can you hook up a movie or boo it! I love ordinary people like me, who can say what I want and I promise not to spoil any movie for someone who has not seen it yet!
