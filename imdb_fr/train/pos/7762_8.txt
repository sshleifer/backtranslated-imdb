In her autobiography, Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie told her that she should not make such foolish films as this or something like that. At the time, Douglas Sirk was referred to as "weepies for women". In fact, he was restored to favor, and when he turned "written on the wind", Sirk had only three films to do: "Tarnished Angels", "A Time to Love and a Time to Die" , his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally "Imitation of Life" (1960). Then there was silence. In fact, the characters of Bacall and Hudson do not interest Sirk. They are too straightforward, they are too virtuous.Dorothy Malone - who was somehow a substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander - and his brother Robert Stack are the main interest of the plot.A conspiracy built continuously, the major part of the movie being a long flashback. The instability of the brother and sister, from a family of wealthy Texan oil owners, is evidenced by garish clothes and shiny cars that run at full speed in landscape derricks. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the film is staggering: suit and bun, playing with a little derrick: she's ready for life, the rebel is tamed. Now alone, because she lost Hudson (but anyway, he was not in love with her). This end is a little reactionary, but melodrama is par excellence reactionary. Three years later, in "imitation of life", Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be blamed because she does not know her place.
