I just released a preview of this movie. He made me laugh every 30 seconds. The end was so funny that tears ran down my face and I wished I had not bought that big coke. There are certainly lulls, but overall very entertaining. The film allows Steve Carell to shine after stealing the spotlight from Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their films. Paul Rudd is hilarious, as always. I like the fact that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in independent dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should have more work, because he is so whimsical and talented. Leslie Mann also had incredibly fun moments. I highly recommend it to anyone who just wants to laugh like crazy. However, if you are easily offended, do not see this movie. If you are a rabid feminist, do not watch this movie. And, please, no matter what, even if you think you're one of those "trendy" parents, do not take your kids to this movie. Of course, you should let your teenagers go to see this movie, but do not watch it with them. It would be incredibly difficult times.
