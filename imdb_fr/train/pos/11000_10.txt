If you are in the film with expectations, throw them out now, as no hype will do justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> To classify this film in a single genre would be criminal. It's a spy thriller, with elements of black, action pieces, science fiction and cyberpunk, all linked together by brilliant narrative, intriguing twists, and superb cinematography. <br /> <br /> the comments here have focused on the fact that it is derived, positively or negatively, from other films. But as they say, every story of Shakespeare is told, so once you get past that, you'll find yourself in a hell of a lot of adventure. <br /> <br /> You will have to suspend your disbelief at times, and while the whole thing never becomes incredible, some parts (read: the elevator) suffer from a limited budget and somewhat tacky graphics. Do not misunderstand the fact that it means at the same level as Sci-Fi channel movies, because the level is much higher. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action, you should turn one way. It's pure psychology. But if you're ready to sit down and spend a good 90 minutes of your life on an unprecedented cinematic experience, by all means, MAKE IT NOW! Watch this movie before it's too cool to have seen it!
