This film kept me constantly entertained. Comparing this to Serial Mom, Mr. Waters returned to his more granular side. It's not so polite. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side here. A message about how success and notoriety is changing a person - but more importantly, how does this change the people around you? <br /> <br /> There is no wrong time in this movie. <br /> <br /> the characters are a little caricature ... but I want to believe that this is what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... that's really his best job.
