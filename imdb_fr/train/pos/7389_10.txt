No show can please everyone. Clearly, if your favorite movies have not won, you will say that the show is not very good. This is understandable. <br /> <br /> However, the 74th Annual Oscars will remain in the spirit for a magical moment in Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> The first appearance of Woody Allen at the Academy Awards. <Br /> <br /> Allen has often dismissed rewards as self-fulfilling and useless, and has never attended - even though he has won many of the coveted awards. <br /> <br /> At the 74th Academy Awards held, the nation was still mourning the loss of life caused by the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. As a tribute to New York City, they decided to show a video of the city's great cinematic moments. Then the announcer simply stated: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, the Oscar-winning director, Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> The place has had a very old ovation. The entertainment industry has finally been able to applaud the Man of New York, which generally avoids the Hollywood scene. As the applause died down, Woody applied some of his legendary spirit to the situation. <br /> <br /> SOME STRONG POINTS: <br /> <br /> "Thank you very much - it compensates for the strip search." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted to get back their Oscars "he joked. "I panicked because the pawnbroker had been bankrupt for a long time and I had no way of recovering anything." <br /> <br /> "But that was not it, I could not do it because of my movie He was not nominated for anything this year, and then it hit me. Maybe they called to apologize. "<br /> <br /> Allen also explained why he had left off all his life the aversion to the Oscars for that special night. <br /> <br /> "For New York I would do anything, so I put on my tuxedo and went down here," Allen said. <br /> <br /> "It's a great film city, it's been a fantastic, moving and exciting backdrop for the movies and it's still a big, big city." <br /> </ p> >
