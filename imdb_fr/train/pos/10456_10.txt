This movie is not about entertainment, or even a movie you want to see to pass the time. This film is a real show of true love that can only come from God. One can not help but be deeply touched while watching this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is the divine love of God which is beautifully described. God's love transcends the heart and the spirit and lasts and is eternal. There is love in a marriage. While the main character is struggling with his wife's illness, he realizes thanks to the love of God that he loves his wife more than he could have imagined. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have the love of the child and the parents. The children of the family get together and realize that nothing matters, except that love triumphs over fear. Dear friends, love is not love if it does not come from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and tell them you love them. Love is useless if it is not given to another. I pray that this film will inspire and change the lives of all who see it. Amen!!
