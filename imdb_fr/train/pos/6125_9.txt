Ok, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the transformation box for the VHS tape and thought it looked interesting. I rent it and bring it home. I was right, it's interesting. They put the spirits of serial killers in dreams, in walking corpses and in everyday machines. But this must be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the friendly snowman images that dot the landscape, the flowerpot, the snow globe, and so on. I like the actor who played the role of Jack. That's right, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's this level of "cool". I would like some puppet effects to be better, the movements of the mouth could have better matched. But I'm afraid it's a small budget. The casting does a great job, there are some great liners and scares to blow up any fan of hardcore horror. All in all, a beautiful story, good effects, a good dialogue and a superb distribution. I give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
