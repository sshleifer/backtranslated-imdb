Greetings again from the darkness. Superb photographs highlight this Disney documentary and give a glimpse into the hardness of animals living in nature. For people over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha 's Wild Kingdom have provided us with a great deal of our vision of wild animals since we were children ... at a time when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic, Nature or Animal Planet. What always fascinates is the difficulty of the circumstances for many of these majestic creatures. Watching elephants walk for days, almost delusional by the lack of water, is so painful. But their night battle against lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some of the underwater shots are out of breath. The mother and her baby are beautiful and watching the great white shark attacking its prey is as scary as "Jaws". The most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I had never seen such a detail of the vastness of the range. <br /> <br /> I do not think most of today's young kids will be too excited about this one, but it's definitely one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries I've ever seen. have already seen.
