Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to have flaws - The back window sometimes looks a little scenic, Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day does not work, the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too old-fashioned, the beginning Nights of Cabiria is a bit too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The scenario is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (even if Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are extraordinary, the whole cast shines), the staging and the photography are inspired, and the Partition is touching without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. It's really one of the best movies I've ever seen and I wish there were more. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that Reese Witherspoon has become a star after this movie, but I'm sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more avoidant and ridiculous than this serious movie that talks about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! A must see.
