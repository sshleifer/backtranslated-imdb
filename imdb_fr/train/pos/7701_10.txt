This has always been one of my favorite movies and will always be. In the last few years, I became a science fiction maniac of the 50s / 60s, trying to collect all the best that had been made at the time. I like a lot about them, from the way they might be tacky to the technical correction of some of them. The beautiful colors and scenery allow me to go there too. It's a shame when they redo some of these good old movies; they do it almost always, - look at the recent repetition of the day when the Earth came to a standstill, it's the trash !! Forbidden Planet is one of the most famous space films of all time, and now they are trying to do it again, and I shudder to think about what the new one will be! In my opinion, some things, such as fantastic classic films, should be left to their own devices, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and thrill the process. Once they have added all the techno bullshit we have now, the movie just seems to be more dog meat from the Hollywood sausage factory, nothing special. By the way, I notice that the Forbidden Planet astronaut uniforms were also used for "Queen of Outer Space"! It just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower then, right? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... <br /> <br /> The great performances of this film by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been 'one of my favorite comedians), Earl Holiman and of course Robby the robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic and the scenario is not exaggerated. It's a great science fiction experience!
