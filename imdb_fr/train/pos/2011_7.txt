If you have never seen this movie and you like old actors, this movie is for you. See Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin, hollow cheeks and a wonderful voice singing beautiful old songs. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) gave an outstanding performance with many dance and music numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played a leading role alongside Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor), who played classical piano and did not play the comedy at bat as he did in his career . This is not an excellent musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see him at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
