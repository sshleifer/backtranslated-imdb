James Michener's books taking readers to far-off places with strange names were probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His South Pacific Tales became a major Broadway success for Rodgers & Hammerstein. The South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and it was natural to make the film adaptation of another success of Michener, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade before US films from the Second World War did not represent the Japanese. nicely. I'm sure the people who fought in the Pacific War did not have the opportunity to change minds overnight. This and a general policy of non-fraternization with the occupied peoples in general are at the heart of this story about the interracial romance. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is a relevant film nowadays. The military has always played in the personal life of its personnel so that no civilian employer can legally escape. At the time of Sayonara's creation in America, there were still laws on miscegenation in many states. Today, gays in the military are a big problem. Someone might someday make a film similar to Sayonara on this issue. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on a well-known course. South Pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. With a sure hand, Logan has assembled a big cast and a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith and some of the Western players are doing a great job. But the picture is stolen by the Orientals here. Miko Taka beautifully hits the mark as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two people who are supporting the Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> The buttons are the members of your air force. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi, played by Miyoshi Umeki. They get married and the army does everything in their power to separate them. They presume to know what is best for pimples and Umeki. Buttons was a television comedian and talented, but he never had a role as brilliant as the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> The oscar Miyoshi Umeki was the first to be attributed to an oriental. This attracted a lot of attention, because at the time of the Oscars, Miyoshi played the main role on Broadway in Flower Drum Song. I had the privilege of seeing it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I have ever seen. I always remember it. <br /> <br /> This Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw Sayonara as a great nation with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays the role of Nakamura, a Kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara had finished today, Logan would never get away. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and a great story. This film should be resurrected more often, it has a great moral.
