If Dick Tracy was in black and white, the pope would not be religious. Giving a new meaning to the concept of color in a movie, we live a unique experience in the world of comics. It is one of the few films to have managed to do it, thanks to a serious scenario, a good realization, superb performances. (Al Pacino is breathtaking) and above all a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costumes. Using only primary colors, the experience is quite different from anything we've seen before. And there is also a fairly successful tribute to the whole genre of gangster film, virtually disappeared from modern cinema. Overall, I consider this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality for a cinema that relies more and more on old formulas and already seen. 7 out of 10
