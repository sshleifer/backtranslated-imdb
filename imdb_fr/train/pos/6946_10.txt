24 must be the best spy / adventure series that TV has ever shown. The whole idea of ​​telling a story in 24 hours is dazzling. The style of filming and rhythm is what makes us look at it. And Jack Bauer is one of the biggest protagonists of a longtime TV series. I like it, as well as the Simpsons and X-Files, my three favorite television series. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate US Senator David Palmer, who is also running for president. Bauer is called to his office to find out who is behind all this and, at the same time, determine the path his daughter will follow to become unknown after fleeing her room. Thus begins an adventure on the best political style and, the best is that it always takes place in real time, which makes this TV series a real work of originality at a time when almost every TV program seems to be broadcast. we do the same things over and over and over again.
