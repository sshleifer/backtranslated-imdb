Then you have to see this movie, to understand the reality. After reading the book, Ms. Duke now defends the rights of people with bipolar disorder. formerly labeled manic depression. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that today people continue to criticize people with emotional problems or those seeking psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thoughts still exist, which is regrettable. <br /> <br /> In this film, the public sees the pain and suffering that Ms. Duke endured, particularly as a child. Many of us may remember her since the teenage girl "Patty Duke Show". She was known in America at the age of 15. <br /> <br /> You learn from his exploitation by Ross (well interpreted by Howard Hesseman). As she grew up in the 1950s, stigma was in full force. However, as his career progresses, we see the disease worsening. She goes through episodes of drug addiction and promiscuity; even marry a person with whom she divorces next week; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and her elderly mother. All these problems occurred before she received adequate treatment, as well as medication. <br /> <br /> A recent survey released by the National Alliance Against Mental Illness (NAMI) found that a majority of American adults do not recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. It was also reported that one in five respondents felt that people could control their disease without drugs if they wished. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) If you watch this movie, you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not "help herself" and "heal" until she was informed of his disorder and receives treatment. Thank you, Ms. Duke, for defending ignorance and prejudice.
