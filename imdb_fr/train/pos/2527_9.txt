This is what I call a "pre-Sci Fi, Sci Fi" movie. He is no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredible animated film of "mood" type. These two real artists are at their best, just like the story. <br /> <br /> Karloff does a remarkable job as a scientist caught in the trap of vanity, pride and scientific competition. I was caught in the idea of ​​watching a drowning man in the three concepts mentioned above. I was both saddened and fascinated by both stars. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that requires a remake. This time, Harrison Ford plays the role of Karloff and perhaps Kieffer Sutherland as Bela Lagosi. It might be possible to do it almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best products ever produced by Hollywood. As I said ... it's not better. No way.
