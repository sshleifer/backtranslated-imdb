I love this anime! I did not care about all the jokes and the violence (mainly about the reluctant but moderate "fiancee" of Akane Ranma), but Ranma deserves it, but he does his best to fix the lack ... clumsy . The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed spring of Jusenkkyo and turn into a girl when she is splashed by cold water. From there, it's pure chaos one after the other. The deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy shampoo, the evil Happosai cause problems to our hero / heroine. However, it is Genma, the selfish father of Ranma, who ends up being the culprit of the disorder most of the time. If someone wants an anime that's funny, that's it. It's cute and better with the Japanese dub.
