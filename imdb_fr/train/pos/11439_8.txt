OK - as far as the 2 versions of this film. There were 2 people involved in the making-of - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really had no say then in the movie - just helped with money) - the 'version Adult 'was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). Thanks to Ladd's films, they did not advertise this film and spent all their advertising money on "The Right Stuff", in the hope that it would win them over; ... and that was not the case. SO, this movie has never really had a chance. When "Twice" managed to switch to cable (HBO) - they showed the reels with Bill's version and John threatened to sue if it was shown (did you notice that the "adult" version was not very long?). Showtime got the "clean" version. The version on the videotape and laser disc is the version approved by John (who holds more power than Bill). Too bad, really, because the "adult" version is actually better and makes more sense. But it is VERY doubtful that it is published in this version on DVD (or any other format without bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information because I was president of the Twice Upon A Time fan club (there are still many elements of the film), which previously had a mailbox version of the "adult" version, but it was stolen - only have a partial copy now). 8 stars for the "adult" version - 5 for the "clean" version. Any other question, just ask.
