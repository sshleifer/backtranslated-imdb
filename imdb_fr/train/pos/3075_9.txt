A brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks like a neurotic sex object but can not afford to work with him at the level required by the script. But he is such a good actor that he played to his level for the scenes to work. I warmly applaud Tracey Ullman's cast as a neglected wife. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character look bigger (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy's representation of the only situation in which her character can not pay attention is nothing less than total control.
