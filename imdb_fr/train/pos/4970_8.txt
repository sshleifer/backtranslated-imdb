Some critics have found this film dark, but for me there was enough humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the discreetly positive and stoic character of the girl is the center of the film, often offsetting the unfortunate aspects of the setting and the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the end result is not predictable: I felt it would have worked anyway. <br /> <br /> By the way, many reviews I've read mention the effective use of black and white, but the impression I saw, aired on the SBS television network here in Australia, was in color. <br /> <br />
