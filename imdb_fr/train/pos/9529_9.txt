It's one of the best films made in 2002. It may not be the best film, but it looks great, it has great acting and is perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with "American Beauty". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things are going to be fine, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), puts his father and Michael on the stage, resulting in the death of the woman and the second son of Jennifer Jason Leigh. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose himself and sends a hit man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to complete the job. Since Michael is a respected man in the organization, he tries to win friends who can help him, including the mafia boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In a way, "Road to Perdition" is a classic gangster movie. but it is so well done that you can hardly see that. This film is good in its conception of production, artistic direction, sound, music and especially in its cinematography. All these elements can surprise and create suspense even if the result is quite certain. The fact that Hoechlin is not an annoying child and that Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act is of course useful. <br /> <br /> This comic-based film is much better than you would expect and, despite its flaws, is one of the best movies of its kind. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for whatever reason, it also seems fresh at the same time. The scenes between adult man Hanks and child Hoechlin help in this area. See this film that will seem familiar sometimes but is totally new in many areas.
