The 1967 movie In Cold Blood may have looked more like the "real thing" (think, would we really like to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a colorful world, and many people do not even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to do it again for television. Also, if you do it again, you can show things that are not shown in the original. Truman Capote's book In Cold Blood was the first "non-fiction novel". Truman's book was actually not faithful to reality. I thought the Canadian site was enough for Kansas for a TV movie. Look for elements of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: the feminization of Dick, Perry being a drug addict with aspirin, Perry playing blues guitar.
