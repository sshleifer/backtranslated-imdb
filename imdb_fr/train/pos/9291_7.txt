An interesting look at Japan before its opening to the West. John Wayne, First Consul of the United States in Japan, arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne finally wins his meeting with the Shogun after mastering a cholera outbreak, introduced by an American ship. Then comes a colorful procession in the capital, which includes gifts for the shogun, including a bottle of old tanglefoot. The encounter with the Shogun, the debates between the Japanese nobles and the assassination during an archery exhibition offer an interesting look at the politics of the time. In short, a rather nice film and in addition how many times do you see the duke lose a fight against a guy twice as small as him?
