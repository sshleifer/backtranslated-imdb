I first saw Thief as a child, which makes me almost as old as the Jinn, I suppose. Like any child, the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film delighted me. Several years later, I realized how much the satire and the spirit of the script had missed me during this first viewing. I have never missed an opportunity to look at it over the years. In addition to the screenplay, the production transcends the fantastic genre. It's Korda, the storyteller at his best. When you see Thief as a child, you know you've had a good time. When you see Thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It is as timeless as the story he treats. An amazing job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
