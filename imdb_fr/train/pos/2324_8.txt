Watching this movie, I started to feel very nostalgic. Growing up in a rural area, I felt like a child again! The swimming pond (called "reservoir" in central Texas), which crosses the countryside like a free and wild spirit! The story was very believable and I totally lost it and cried towards the end. Through the pain we live in life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
