This film tells a moving adventure of 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an incurable disease that killed his brother at the age of 19 and is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. He and a few close friends roam the country in Los Angeles to personalize his wheelchair on MTV's Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. The gang is heading west for a trip that all of its participants will never forget. Darius gets on a boat for the first time, rides a hot air balloon, swims in the ocean and visits tourist sites he has always wanted to see, such as the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection with the material. They do not make money with sales of $ 20 DVDs. $ 17 go to research on the disease and $ 3 to make more copies. The film has won more than 25 awards in festivals and I share the quote given to the film by Variety, "Certain to thrilled hearts".
