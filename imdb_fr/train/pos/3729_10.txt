Although I suppose this film has the status of anti-Vietnamese, I did not think it was, because it was simply an honest look at the perspective of war-trained young people. that the public did not support ... it showed their fear, their despair, their will ... all this, in the open air, naked. As a soldier, many themes have remained faithful to my experience in the military - especially the training camp. Overall, the film, although shot on a very small budget, looks great, is very well mounted, and has great actors and directors. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for another great Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
