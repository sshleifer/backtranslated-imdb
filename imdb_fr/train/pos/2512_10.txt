As a big fan of Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I learned that they had made a film together and that my mission in life was to see him. I was not deceived. In fact, this film has far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for courageous performances but not really fulfilling, but I'm delighted to say that they both managed to keep me captivated and believe in the world. 'history. Moon Child has just the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious, heartbreaking moments. I can not say that I have never cried so much in front of a movie and these tender moments are admirably interpreted by the couple, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. The fight scenes are absolutely superb and although there is some uncertainty to begin with, you quickly get into the movie and start linking to the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
