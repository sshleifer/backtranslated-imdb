Like many of you, I'm a big fan of the real thing - the 1940s black movies - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us who aspire to the past. The term "neo-black" has been so often inappropriately used over the last decade that it has lost its meaning and impact. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserved to be described as such. The cast is perfect all around and would feel like home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you are hooked in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have appreciated. Many contemporary movies let me wonder why they do not do them as before, and I'm not even so old. Films like Red Rock West give us hope for the future while paying homage to the past.
