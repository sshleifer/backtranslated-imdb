Extremely interesting and intriguing film. The similarities with David Lynch (who is even literally quoted by the presence of red curtains in the film) and novels Franz Kafka (the housekeeper in this film is called Mrs Grubach, like that of Der Prozess ... ) are clearly present, but in this case are accompanied by clear references to Belgium's colonial past in Africa. The exact content of the film, I can not describe it clearly: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are also a central issue and his quest of the society. contact and love. These are the symbolic themes that I deduced from the film, but in reality they are just impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you simply try to follow the linear history without these symbolic backgrounds, you will still discover an extremely fascinating film filled with beautiful images (close-ups of beatles, larvae and other nasty insects alternate with beautiful dream sequences and a dark atmosphere that gives the movie an extra style). Maybe you can say I did not quite understand the movie, but it's been an hour and a half that I look hypnotized, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the mysterious fascinating.
