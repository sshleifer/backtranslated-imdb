I waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of H.G. Wells' classic novel, "War Of The Worlds". Timothy Hines finally did it! I could not believe how good it was! From the game to the special actors out of the ordinary, I can not say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performances of a first-rate cast! You have to see it to believe it. I'm sure that it's not the case. And I read all these negative comments from others and I can not believe what they were saying. We had to watch a different movie, huh? And those very bad comments of that vepsaian guy, whoever he is, well, well, he just does not know what he's talking about. Hines.
