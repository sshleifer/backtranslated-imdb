Freebird is the perfect marriage of the comedy road, the movie "Stoner" and the British film "well-being". <br /> <br /> These are the brilliant main characters who distinguish this film from other films of this kind. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and make their characters extremely likeable and realistic. The main story centers on their car trip from London to Wales, as well as on adventures and incidents that happen along the way. This little movie also has a big heart - it's not just for bike fans, it's based on the relationships between characters, including dreams and regrets, like Fred, Gary Stretch's family-seeking he left. Cinematography is also excellent - a love letter for the Welsh countryside, as well as capturing the rough character of London's streets and the typical bar life in Welsh country towns. <br /> <br /> An elegant, sleek, fantastic soundtrack, friendly characters and fun storyline - I would recommend Freebird without hesitation!
