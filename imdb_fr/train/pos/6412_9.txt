I'm certainly happy that a film was made about Carl Brashear's amazing life story. As in the civil rights era, Brashear became a source of inspiration for members of all minority groups who did not want to be content with the expected status. <br /> <br /> Brashear, interpreted by Cuba Gooding, Jr. the conduct of the life he has chosen. Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated baseball and made him stick by his character and his conduct. As a Brashear, Gooding knows he does not want the farmer life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly clearly explains how to make the most of his life. <br /> <br /> But while Harry Truman joined the Armed Services Group after World War II, the navy still has its restrictions. A black man can only be a cook or an officer's valet, the real parties to the fight are denied. That's not good enough for Gooding who wants to become a deep-sea divers. <br /> <br /> Once at the diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Gooding is defeated, mostly by the master grandmaster. in charge, Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may have some remnants of prejudices, but he is a hero who can inspire if we can push the racial gap. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding. They certainly come from different places, but as they know each other, they are both men of honor. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted good performances: Charlize Theron, wife of DeNiro, and Hal Holbrook, responsible. of the diving school, a man that the navy would like to retire for reasons that you will see previously. <br /> <br /> Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people who have the courage to spare and who have the ability to change.
