I was very moved by the story and because I saw something similar with my own parents, I really connected. It is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they made and with which they have to live. I loved the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? She is fantastic! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown - it was so beautiful. Overall, the film's appearance was breathtaking, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very very good in this picture, he humanizes a man who turns spiral. I liked the way the director approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hang on, but not enough to bog us down.
