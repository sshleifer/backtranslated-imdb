After all these years, I still consider this series as the best example of documentary filmmaking on the Second World War. Interviews with the many participants from all countries distinguish this project from any other project. Would it be great to see a contemporary documentaryist (Ken Burns?) Tackling this and trying to gather information from veterans before they all left. With modern technology to enhance the old archive footage and much information that has been unearthed since 1974, the year of the creation of The World At War, an updated version of this series would be welcome. History Channel has produced good shows dealing with many aspects of the Second World War, but a series as complete as World at War has not been successfully tested since the original. If you are interested in this era, do not miss this series. It is mandatory to watch.
