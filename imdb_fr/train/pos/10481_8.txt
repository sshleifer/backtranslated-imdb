A nice little film that would not even offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to have been cut from the same fabric as half a dozen other British comedies in the last two years ... the oppressed is confronted with adversity, finds the strength to challenge learns something about himself in the process. <br /> <br /> Widowed and therefore mowed, Grace is a master gardener and is responsible for helping her friend / employee Matthew grow a potted plant. He's all wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize that she is the ideal person to harvest the pot, which they can take advantage of. He likes to smoke, she needs to raise money to pay his mortgage. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the evening is Grace, who travels to London to take care of some of her wares, dressed in what looks like a white suit worn by John Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever "and therefore comes out as a thumb wound. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always visible, and so can not be said of many people ... well, I can not, anyway. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo, whom I liked in "The Nikita Woman", is memorable. <br /> <br /> Not very moving or insightful, but immensely entertaining and, after an hour and a half, it's like taking a walk with friends. 8/10.
