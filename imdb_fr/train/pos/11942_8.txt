At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how stubborn he was to look for a scoop. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of the serial killer of London tarot cards. He deceives the Reaper and appears to the American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on the scene in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells him that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in his investigation, looking for evidence that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and wonders if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great comedy from Woody Allen outside Manhattan, again in London. His ironic and witty remarks are simply fantastic and I laughed a lot with his fate as a hero in a country where people drive "the wrong way". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in excellent shape as a comedian. However, his current muse Scarlett Johansson, of which I am a big fan, is over-acting and annoying at several points, changing his inclusive accent into a histrionic pronunciation. His character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and I was quite disappointed with his performance (probably for the first time in his filmography). But this supernatural comedy is always a hilarious and useful entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
