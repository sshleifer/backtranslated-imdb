I saw this movie when I was little on television (thanks to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I had nightmares for years afterwards. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors of Bratislav Pojar, one of Canada's Best Animators at the National Film Board. Pojar was in turn mentor and collaborator of the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The symbolism is obvious, but cleverly used. The story of beauty and life (the plant) opposes the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite the lack of political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I remember most was the feeling of oppression that reigned in the set. The small room where the action takes place is the whole world of the character. Invasion by the hand is a total violation of this world. <br /> <br /> A magnificent and haunting film. I found a copy of this beautiful Trnka short film in the public library and showed it to my own children. A must see.
