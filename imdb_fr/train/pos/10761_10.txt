My roommate bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her. She comes from China and has heard so much about 9/11. She wanted to know the hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary. I felt very bad looking at this documentary, it was like reliving the nightmare and it always made me cry. <br /> <br /> But I'm extremely grateful for watching this documentary, because on September 11, I'm sure we all remember where we were and what we did when we heard, we could not all what about some questions: "Why?", "How?", "What's going on?", "Oh, my God!" Almost all Americans were grateful to the firefighters and brave police who risked their lives to save others. But I do not think we thought about what they were really going to do. It was not supposed to be a 9/11 documentary, the cameraman was just filming a typical work day and they were just a few blocks away from the World Trade Centers and they had everything outside and outside. inside cassette. <br /> <br /> On September 11th, I said to myself: "It does not matter, the police and firefighters will bring out the people who have survived." To be honest, I thought it was an accident, I was in my first year of high school, I changed my gym and I was getting ready for my science class. Someone entered the locker room shouting "A building has just been bombed in New York!", We all dressed quickly and ran into our classrooms watching the first tower burning on television . Fifteen seconds later, live on television, the second plane crashed against the World Trade Center and we knew it was not an accident. A few minutes later we heard about the Pentagon and the fact that a plane was heading for Chicago but was shot down. So many thoughts ran through my mind and I kept asking myself, "What are the firefighters and police doing?" But that's the procedure I thought, they would know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower collapsed, we knew it, so many lives are now gone, the second tower collapsed, things would never be the same again. even. The firefighters of this documentary showed courage, confusion and strength, real raw human emotions. They did not know what to do, they were as marked as the other people who were in the towers. They heard the bodies collapse on the floor as a result of people jumping out the window. And I was in a classroom crying when I saw everything that was happening on television. I was amazed by this film and I just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all the Americans were for their help. I know they feel like they're just doing their job, but they did more, they were heroes. Every day after September 11, they continued digging for three weeks, knowing that there were no survivors, but they continued to hope and pray. May God bless their kind and courageous hearts. <br /> <br /> As for my roommate, she cried and admitted it was the first time she cried at these attacks. She could see the truth about what happened on that tragic day. She asked "Why?" I did not know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be so perverse. "It sounds like a clique," but it was a normal day for everyone, "said one of the firefighters in the documentary, no one expected that to happen. people from the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon, or hijacked planes simply did their job, were there, or even were there for just a second, they were not just murdered, they were hijackers did it with a song in their heart.See, seeing in the Middle East all people celebrate, why do people do that? They celebrated the death and loss of: mothers, fathers sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Why? <br /> <br /> Thank you to these people for making this documentary - you really think of firefighters, police and troops in Iraq and you keep hope that there are good people in this world, thanks to all these people , you are our heroes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
