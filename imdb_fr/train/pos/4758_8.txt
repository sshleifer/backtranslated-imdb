After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft crashing into a frozen wood, two police officers found evidence of the occurrence and apparently a Martian had moved away from the scene. They go to the nearby Hi-Way caf√© and find a stopped bus and seven passengers waiting for the reopening of a snow-covered bridge. However, the driver says he only had six passengers when he parked the bus. While questioning the travelers, strange things happen in the restaurant: lights on and off and platinum on and off. When the passengers are released and the bus follows its route, a passenger returns to the restaurant and reveals an invasion plot of the Earth. <br /> <br /> "The real Martian, please, stay up?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The fascinating story features ironic and witty dialogues, amusing characters and situations, and a surprising and unexpected plot point at the end. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("The Martian")
