I consider myself a great movie buff. I was sick on the couch and jumped in this movie. From the beginning to the end, I watched with admiration these great actors, I had never seen say a great word. The shooting was magnificent. It was just what I needed. I hope this message will be heard after all the bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout. Thank you for making a movie like this. Just wonderfully clumsy, nice, kind characters who are defective and gracious at the same time. Just awesome. I can not submit this without 10 lines in total, so I'm just going to say that I want more from this director, more from all the actors in this movie and more from the writer. I did not want it to end. The end
