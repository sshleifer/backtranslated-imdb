My watch came a little too late, but I'm happy to have watched this together and the rest together ... which allows me to congratulate the authors of this film for treating in a pure and fundamental way the idea of romance ... and separating very marginally is the idea of ​​relations! As many things have already been written on the film, it would be fair to highlight some passages from the film that I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think Jesse and Celine make phone calls to their phones. The respective friends were a very clever way to tell each other what they meant for each other during a trip that did not extend even over 24 hours ... the curiosity of two people who think that the other had a foolproof impact on the other was treated very well ... <br /> <br /> As for the plot, make sure that a romantic story focuses on a conversation pure is not easy to do .. <br /> <br /> I believe in romance romantic Thus, the characters are not clearly designed, even in the mind of the author and the director. What the actors bring out is what they become. True or false, even the carriers of ideas would have difficulty to justify themselves ... to become the character, the life that the actor gives must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here the two actors just do the right job! Kudos .. !!! and Before sunset is another feather that makes this one even more beautiful!
