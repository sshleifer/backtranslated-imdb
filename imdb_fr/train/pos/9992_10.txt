... it's a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes that no one should miss. Beautiful story, fun situations between riches and rags, Mel Brooks is not a bad track, maybe not perfect, but it's funny; D Do not pay attention to the odds, it's BS. Look at it, then look at something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you do, I do not think we can be friends. XD At this point, I recommend the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to all Brooks fans;) Vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms! I have to do 10 lines here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
