A beautiful film that deeply touches the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This film was almost perfect, and as nothing in this world can be really perfect, it's pretty good. The only minor thing that I subjectively oppose is the rhythm at times in the middle of the story. The acting game is also very good, and all actors are easily the best actors in high-profile films. The staging seems to have been well thought out and the script must be incredible. There are truly breathtaking moments of prefiguration and an absolutely magnificent circular composition of history. <br /> <br /> The moment in the film, where the main character realizes that the feeling of being in paradise is the perfect ending for a truly brilliant thread.
