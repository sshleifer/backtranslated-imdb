Jim Belushi's entertaining vehicle, a fun and modern version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a sort of angel that lets Belush see what his life would have been like if he had made it "big". Jim is at his best with a good story and a support cast; seems to be a real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar nominee, but a warm pleasure.
