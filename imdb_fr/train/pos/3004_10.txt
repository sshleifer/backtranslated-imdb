Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve several murders among the rich after a dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate overly complicated mysteries (like this one), but I LOVE this movie. It moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that speed up the story), has a very ingenious story (including an incredible solution to a murder in a closed room key)) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is very sweet and great because Vance - he does not seem to play the role - it's Vance! Mary Astor does not have much to do, but she adds class and beauty to the production. Everyone is very good too, but the best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious. <br /> <br /> Basically, an excellent murder mystery in Hollywood in the 1930s. Worth a look. <br /> <br />
