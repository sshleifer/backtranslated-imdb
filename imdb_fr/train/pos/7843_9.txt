I can not believe they removed it from the air. Especially when they only had a few episodes left. My daughter, sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show. We were so angry when they stopped showing this because of the so-called notation. It's not fair to people watching this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I hope they get a global vote of all people with a voting system 3 times a year. They could send papers in the mail and we, the viewers, could vote globally on all the programs we watch or have heard about. It could also help promote a new show. People would see it and wonder what it was. You can not only see what viewers are watching, but you can also use it as a free advertising tool for TV channels and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back !!
