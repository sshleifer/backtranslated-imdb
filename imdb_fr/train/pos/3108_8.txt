This payment is reminiscent of the CIA as a very stupid organization. In reality, maybe they are. After all, depending on the scenario, a man has the power to sanction the murder of everyone, including his people, to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon does a very credible job. Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of the entire movie. He always tries to remember who he was and how he got where he is. He is helped by a few people and it seems like every minute of the movie is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time to rest in this film and the action sequences seem very real. . There are many chase sequences filmed with the shaky camera that, in a way, add to the realism and make it look less Hollywood than many images. These sequences add realism to the film. <br /> <br /> The suspense in some sequences is brilliantly realized when you wonder if a person will die or if Bourne can dismiss them. This is the kind of action thriller you will see when you want to be entertained and I'm sure this one will lead to the next movie in the series.
