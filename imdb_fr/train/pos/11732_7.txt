OK, I saw that in the theaters when he came out and I do not know why. I have not seen it since, but I ended up on this page because I was thinking about this movie - again, I do not know why. But the fact that I remember it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult - much more difficult than any other drama. Doing things right makes things easy, but doing things wrong ... is there worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, be careful, you fall into this category again for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark had to do the right thing so I could remember the film with tenderness. Made at a fast pace, with tongue in the cheek and knowing that this is not the story of Philedelphia, he entertains from start to finish. Brain Donors is another solution that fits this category (without most free jokes). <br /> <br /> A point of contention - the end. It seems that writers / directors have no idea how to finish a comedy. The ending is trying to be a love story, somewhat sapping the strange and fast dialogue so far. Then there is the scene "tassle". While this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so exaggerated and misplaced that it's like a shock. Another rewrite of the end was needed. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect it and let puns and lousy pleasure come to you, you'll laugh, I guarantee you.
