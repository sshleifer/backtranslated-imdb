** Spoiler possible *** Adam Sandler is usually portrayed in Comedy, but in "Reign", the show is deeply upsetting. Although there are some people who showed Courage in the face of September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a Lonely widower and "lost in his own world" .Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his former college boyfriend (Sandler) and wants to catch up on "The good old days" .We see, as in Rain Man ( Dustin Hoffman), Fineman Oldies' music appears as a "psychological" crutch on which he can lean. <br /> <br /> Johnson is looking at Fineman for that certain pleasure and ease that he misses his family.He also feels unhappy and dissatisfied in his work.In the same example, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not not fall into the "cracks" social. I came out of this movie, with a different perspective and more sympathetic Compassion for families in mourning.
