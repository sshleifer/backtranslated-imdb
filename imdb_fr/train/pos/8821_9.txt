The question is whether such an entertaining film can really be considered a "bad" film. My husband and I took this from a used video store at a price of 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box bore the words "Vestron Pictures" (Vestron is still considered a quality brand since the first has acquired the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984"). We did not expect a film as winning as this one. Your basic plot is this: Grange, this Goombaesque thug from Planet Earth, steals "the shore of the Moon" and is sentenced to a prison colony on a distant planet (I do not even remember his name) at the bauxite and other minerals. The "governor" of the said colony and the owner of the mine exploit the prisoners for work. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the entire planet) reminds prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one shuttle on the planet and they must take charge of it. Then there is the unnamed "colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting nightmare. Much of the film is centered on "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped on the sides) with explosions galore. The planet itself is strangely similar to Hemet, California or to one of those dusty outposts of the Inland Empire. But what makes the film really brilliant is a surprisingly impressive soundtrack with several LA punk bands from the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack has ever been pressed for vinyl, but it's definitely worth the worth buying the movie only for the soundtrack. I do not even remember the names of the groups (mentioned in the credits) other than Exploding White Mice, because it was the only one I heard about before seeing this movie, but I'm really looking for them . <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie is certainly not a waste of time and would be better appreciated with a pack of 12 beers and some of your closest friends.
