Unveil the funniest parody of pretentious art movies ever made. <br /> <br /> This movie exposes all the clich√©s, and more! Incredibly bad actors (Downs syndrome!). Terribly heavy self important dialogue. Scenes meant to shock but fall flat. Jarring edition. Plot points not applicable. All wrapped up in a sort of mocking miasma of disrespect for the public and vague psychological thoughts. <br /> <br /> It does exactly what it was designed for. A hilarious satire of these tedious movies made by spoiled teenage treats, to show their parents when they ask them what they do for two years! After "what is it?" Received his prize in Cannes, the presenter Werner Herzog would have been informed that the film was actually a parody, in part of his own movies! He supposedly exploded on the info. To date, he refuses to discuss the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, see it and laugh, it will be a classic of humor for many years.
