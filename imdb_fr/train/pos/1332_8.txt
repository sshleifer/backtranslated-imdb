In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the French and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portuguese. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás and despite his trial to convince them that he is French, they believe it to be Portuguese. The French becomes their slave and lives maritally with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he uses powder in the guns left by the Portuguese to defeat the Tupiniquins during a battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso or Meu Francês" is another excellent low-budget film by the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The scenario is very original and the story is told in Tupi. The film is shot in natural light most of the time and is very realistic. The actors and actresses play naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is gorgeous, showing a wonderful body and offering amazing performance. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by the Europeans, concentrating on the Portuguese and the French at the time, trading with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors with our natural resources. This film has been awarded in national festivals, such as the Brazilian Film Festival of Brasilia (1971) with the best screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), the best dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and the best repository ( Régis Monteiro); The Association of Art Critics of São Paulo (Philippine Association of Art Critics), with the best revelation of the year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other awards. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The period that preceded Gostoso or Meu Francês" ("How tasty was my French")
