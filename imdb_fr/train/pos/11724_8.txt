Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the host of a cheap horror show. When she discovers that her dead aunt has left her objects, Elvira goes to England to pick them up, hoping it will be money. But to her horror, Elvira discovers that all that her aunt has left her is her house, her dog and a cookbook. Anyway, Elvira decides to settle in the house, but she will not be able to live in peace thanks to her dark and striking glances and her breathtaking features. All the neighbors are now turning the entire city against her, and with Elvira's outrageous attitude and look, everyone should be careful, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to see Elvira dive into all these adventures, she's just great. The whole movie puts you in a Halloween mood, of course, it's silly and the jokes are cheap but it's a pleasure to watch it. I would give Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark 8/10
