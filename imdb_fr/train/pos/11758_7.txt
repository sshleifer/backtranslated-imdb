Spoiler This movie talks about such a concept. Williams will go out of his way to replay the football game that haunts his life. Russel plays the ex jock that culminated in high school. Finally, the sub-dog gets his shot, and Williams can save the face instead of being the clown. A great tragedy reversed. 7/10
