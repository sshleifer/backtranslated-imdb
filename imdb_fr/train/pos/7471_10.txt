Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I expected to be disappointed by the film because I had heard that he had not received excellent reviews. However, I left the cinema completely impressed by the quality of Vanilla Sky. <br /> <br /> There was no bad action in the whole film, each character is credible. The romantic moments between the character of Cruise, David Aames and the character of Cruz, Sophia are realistic and intimate (probably because they formed a future couple). <br /> <br /> The intrigue of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there is very little chance that you will guess the end. However, the ends are tied towards the end, leaving you with a strange mix of feelings of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention. It's not that difficult, because you risk being completely absorbed by the film and not leaving the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> I usually leave cinemas, forgetting any movie I just watched. But Vanilla Sky remains etched in my memory a few days after watching it. I recommend it to all those who wish to change simple and superficial films.
