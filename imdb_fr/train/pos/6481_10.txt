I saw this series when I was a child and I loved the detail in which she entered without ever forgetting it. I finally bought the DVD collection and that's exactly what I remembered. This is exactly what a doc should be, unbiased and factual. The film is amazing and the interviews are fantastic. "Die Deutschen Panzer" is the only other series I have found. <br /> <br /> I would only like Hollywood to sit down and watch this series. They could then make great war movies. <Br /> <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Save Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of our Fathers and When Trumpets Fade, I Recommend
