Although I can understand the bad things that someone has to say about this movie, I still found it absolutely amazing. It will affect you, and unless your critic deepens the flaws and misfortunes of each film, or you are simply not touched by anything, it is worth seeing. Do not go into the movie without expecting anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. It's beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, despite playing another lonely and depressed player, is incredible. I think a good actor is someone who can truly describe the feelings and emotions we all experience in our worst / best experiences in such a way that it touches you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give him a chance.
