Another remarkable foreign film that analyzes in depth the endless harvest of crud emanating from Hollywood! It's a story of life and life. No, certainly not the perfect little life so often portrayed in totally artificial Hollywood movies, but rather real life with real characters each with their strengths and weaknesses, just like real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamic of all these lives, intertwined in the walls of this public bath, and especially its old owner, is beautiful, touching the heart and causes a lot of thoughts. <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax and let your life be simple and beautiful. There is real wisdom to learn in this film if you do not open it. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
