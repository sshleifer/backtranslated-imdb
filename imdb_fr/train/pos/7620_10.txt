Lost is the best TV series ever. First of all, she has very good actors and a wonderful staging. Writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary, but after the third season, the writing became extremely complex. For example, who is Jacob, why is there Polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that writers are lost and that they have raised many questions and mysteries. I believe that if the mysteries are revealed, all the charm of the series will be gone. Anyway, lost is undeniably the biggest TV series. and it will continue for a long time.
