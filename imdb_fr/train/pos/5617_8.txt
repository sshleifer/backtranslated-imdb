After his homage to classic black film, Chinatown, Roman Polanski, returns to the themes that earned him his greatest success in the 1960s with this terrifying psychological horror that, like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, deals with paranoia and claustrophobia generated by living in an apartment. <Br /> <br /> Claustrophobic environments are the ones that Polanski is best able to create, and this must be the most suffocating and confined image he has ever created. The emphasis on sidewalls and distant vanishing points is more important than ever and even in the few outer scenes, the sky is only rarely seen. But the tenant is not only confined to space, but also in the intensity with which he focuses on his protagonist. Trelkovsky, played by Polanski himself, does not appear only in all the scenes, he is practically in all the planes. When not on the screen, the camera becomes Trelkovsky's point of view. And of course, almost everywhere he looks, he sees his own reflection looking at him in a mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any film that speaks more about the internalisation and loneliness of a character. Some psychological thrillers, like M or Peeping Tom, make us complain for the protagonist with mental illness. Others, like Psycho, attempt a thorough scientific analysis of his mental state. The tenant does not fit any of these categories ?? it simply plunges us completely into Trelkovsky's experience without requiring us to really understand or appreciate what's going on in his head. One feels his paranoia and his obsession, even if it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational. <br /> <br /> Polanski was also a master of the horror movie that was unfolding slowly. Often, in its horrors, there is an ambiguity as to whether something sinister is actually happening, but they are among the most effective to scare away audiences. Why? It is precisely because they unfold so slowly and they invest so much time in carefully preparatory situations that they plunge the viewer into paranoia. The ninth door is a horror much later, but at least she still manages to realize this terrifying feeling. <br /> <br /> It's a rare chance to see Polanski himself inside. a major role. His talent in front of the camera was as good as behind, and he is absolutely perfect like the sweet Trelkovsky. Another remarkable performance is that of the neglected concierge Shelley Winters. In fact, it is more of a stellar cast, although many familiar faces seem out of place in this strange European Gothic film. In addition, unfortunately, many French actors playing supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the English version. <br /> <br /> The tenant is more polite and less pretentious than Repulsion, but lacks the suspense and character that makes Rosemary's Baby. so captivating and entertaining. The tenant is good, with no major flaws, and Polanski was really fit as a director, but it's not one of his most captivating works.
