I would love to give Kolchak a higher score, but the series went from fear / suspense to ridicule. The fault of ABC. They moved the show on Friday night at 8:00 pm, then known as "family time". I should never have been on Friday in the first place. I was in the second year of high school and I loved the first episodes! It was first against Police Woman on NBC. ABC had huge problems with Friday night. Bad season for them until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT make their debut in January 75. Kolchak should have been a success. Darren McGavin begged to withdraw from his contract to end the show. Too bad the writing did not live up to Richard Matheson in the original TV movies. Yet McGavin has made Kolchak his own, as the actors can. We think of Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker. This INS set with manual typewriters and slamming teletypes seems today strange and old, but it was part of the call. They were very lucky to see Simon Oakland take over "Vincenzo" in TV movies.
