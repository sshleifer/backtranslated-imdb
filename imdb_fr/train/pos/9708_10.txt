I had never really watched this program before, even though it was highly recommended by my family members. Curiously, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (the filming location) and she pointed out some landmarks on my first visit. <br /> <br /> This sparked my interest, so I bought the first series on video and sat down to watch. In addition to recognizing some of the places, I was not surprised at all. Once again, the BBC has been commissioned to produce another example of the world's finest comedy. TLOG easily ranks with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I'm addicted to the program now. The characters are beautiful and show an unusual depth while maintaining a frighteningly realistic edge. The appearance of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes dark sensations of the North (no disrespect to Hadfield for which I found a very warm and welcoming place). <br /> <br /> I only hope that it will continue the originality throughout its course (based on the 2nd series which ended last night in the United Kingdom, it is certainly the case) . <br /> <br /> Well done the BBC !!
