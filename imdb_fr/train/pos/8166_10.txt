This movie is really great! The role is good, with an excellent cast of Corbin Bernsen as a perfectionist dentist who panics and tortures his patients. At first, he sees his wife with the man by the pool, then he goes crazy. He also takes revenge on his wife and the pool attendant, alongside the patients he tortures. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really false (like a pierced tongue, which has spent a night outside and is still red in the morning). But the scenes of torture are absolutely well done. Although this film has the weak point, it is very slow; between the heavy parts are sometimes only extremely boring parts. But for real horror / thriller fans, it's a must!
