Panic is a sneaky gem of a movie - you think you understood it after half an hour only to report with pleasure that Henry Bromell is a writer / director much better than this one. <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly, scene after scene, perfectly performed by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most remarkable children actor I 've seen for a long time David Dorfman, Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they had created completely black thoughts in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this film will remain long after the credits.
