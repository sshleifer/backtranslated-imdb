Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) banished from his kingdom because of the murder of his father (the king) by the clich√© "advisor of the devil". This film talks about Simon's adventures. The special effects, the plot, the acting and, generally, everything about this movie is BAD. However, it's so bad that it's funny. You will continue to watch this movie simply because it's so bad that it's funny, and, as the other reviewer of the film said, it's a shame that it's a good thing.
