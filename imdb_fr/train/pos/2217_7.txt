I'm normally skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on novels, because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I guess the author was a producer and executive writer, huh?) <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional. I can not describe how much I enjoyed seeing so many actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> The filming frame ... I was expecting to see the houses and cottages that I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the screen was slightly different. However, that was not enough for me not to like the miniseries. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have it. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
