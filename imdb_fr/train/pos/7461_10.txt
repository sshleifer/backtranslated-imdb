Similar to Fight Club, Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche as never before. The first 30 minutes are an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is confusing, you will choose more each time you watch it (I went to the cinema to see it 3 times now)
