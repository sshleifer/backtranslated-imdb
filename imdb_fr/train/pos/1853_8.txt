Well, it's still a movie that plays with your feelings and you get out of it as opposed to a rock movie. But I'm a con for those so I gave him a good score ... the acting was very good and there was a lot of feeling. The violence is reduced to a minimum, which changes. I would have given a 9 if there was no salvation at the end! All in all, it's a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
