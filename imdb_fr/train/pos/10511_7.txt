"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, she paints, goes with her friends on her chariot up and down, says hello to the people of the city and tries to make match everyone she knows. I guess there were no movies, no TV at the time, and the girls had nothing to do except gossip. I wish she had read a little more. I love Gwyneth and think she is a beautiful young woman. She has talent and in "Emma" we have the privilege of hearing Gwyneth sing. I can not wait to see "Duets", where she is supposed to sing. She is brave to speak British English with all these British, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dancing at Lughnasa). "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the royalty of American cinema and is none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St Elsewhere) and Tony Winner of the Blythe Danner Award (The Myth of Fingerprints). I hope she will be here for a very long time. We are lucky! I liked Emma and I recommend it too. This is one of those old stories that are still relevant today. Favorite scenes: Emma singing and playing the piano. I particularly like when she sings a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you did not ask me to make an enigma." Emma: "Your whole personality is an enigma, Mr. Knightley, I thought you were overqualified." Miss Bates: "It left us speechless, very speechless, I tell you, and we have not stopped talking about it ever since."
