I must say that Higher Learning is one of the 3 best films I have ever watched. He has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director. Singleton shows how much life at university can be. There are 3 main lines, skinheads, African-Americans and homosexuals. All the stories intrigued me, but the one that touched me the most is the story of Kristen, who fights her feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After watching the movie more than 25 times, I'm still crying. I would have given this movie an 11, but I have to settle for 10/10.
