Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is responsible for New York's oldest floating craps game, and he needs $ 1,000 to move to a new location. Sure of his chances, he bets on Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), the most prominent player in the city, on the impossibility of seducing missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). "Guys and Dolls (1955)" is an excellent musical because it skillfully blends the contrasting styles of the film and the stage. During a dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move rhythmically, stopping and starting as if they were responding to backstage signals. Even the walking movements are stylized and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. The city of Mankiewicz in New York is a shimmering mix of colors and art deco movements, an imaginary world so far removed from reality that even the underground gaming and criminal gangsters trade looks perfectly awesome. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review, I just learned that Jean Simmons died at age 80. It's amazing, it was the first time I saw her in a movie, but she was dazzled. me from the beginning. Sarah, his idealist and sexually repressed, comes out of his shell after a frenzy of alcohol in Havana, indulging in an adorable rendition of "If I had been a bell". Although Simmons and Brando are both non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn has decided not to double their voice, saying "maybe you do not sound so good, but at least it's you." In spite of Goldwyn's self-confidence, both of them do well to bring themselves whole musical numbers. Simmons suggests the same childish vivacity that Audrey Hepburn could have brought to the role, and Brando has such an assurance and such a charisma that it does not matter that his sung voice is not quite there.
