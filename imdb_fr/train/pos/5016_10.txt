This film is one of my favorites. It's hard to explain why. It may be Corin Nemec's innocence and clumsiness associated with Cheryl Pollak's daring, but it certainly has something to do with the soundtrack. In addition, some characters have small lines, movements or fun moments in themselves. Finally, history is one that always touches my heart, and the last scene is so sweet-bitter. Overall, I love this movie. it's perfect for a gooey and sentimental night between girls.
