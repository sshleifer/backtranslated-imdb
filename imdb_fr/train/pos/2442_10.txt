This film talks about one side of Ireland that the Americans do not normally see, the narrow-minded side, the religious prejudices of the "world's most friendly race". The film, admitted by the inhabitants of Fethard, old enough to remember the events, is quite precise (although they insist that the filmmakers have invented some of the most violent scenes simply to spice up the action). <Br /> <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it portrayed the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church * organized * the minority veto (before Protestants it was the Jews). <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole question of religion in Ireland
