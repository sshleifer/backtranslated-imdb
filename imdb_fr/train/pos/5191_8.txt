Scott is right. The best duel duel ever seen is in the middle of this movie. Sword fighting with several fighters is not the best, even if they are good enough. However, the fight in the middle is the best compared to Japanese samurai movies. In my opinion, Chinese sword scenes have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where a guy has to fight a group of enemies, the excellent Japanese movies, for example the Lone Wolf and Cub series. Even if the duels in Japanese cinema last only a few seconds, or even a minute, their intensity makes them better. But this is an example where the Chinese sword surpasses the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five-minute fight with the most amazing choreography of all time. The other fights of this movie are good too, but even if they failed, this movie would have a 7 for this scene. If you have not seen it, you must do it. John Woo is the man.
