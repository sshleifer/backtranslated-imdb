Before watching this movie, I thought this movie would be great as Flashpoint, because before watching this movie, Flashpoint was the last film of Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong that I had already watched. As for the sexual scenes, I was disappointed. I thought that Dreamquest's sexual scenes would be excellent as Flashpoint sex scenes, but I was disappointed. Except the sex scene of Asia Carrera, no sexual scene of this film makes me feel good (you know what I mean). Great Jenna Jameson does not do that kind of sex scene she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, these two pretty girls disappoint me as much regarding the sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Although this is an adult film, but apart from that, this film is very good. If the typical adult film standards are concerned, this film definitely raises the standards of adult movies. The stories, the actors, the staging, the sets, the make-ups and other technical elements of this film are really great. The actors in this movie played very well, they all did a good job. Dreamquest has definitely raised the bar for the quality of adult movies.
