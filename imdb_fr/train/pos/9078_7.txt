In general, the plot was much better than I expected. The laughter track was a little annoying at times and tended to hinder; however, there were enough real laughs in this episode to catch up. My biggest surprise was that some of the best lines and situations are not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in his best light during previous promotions, but his character behaves pretty well in the pilot project. There are enough treats to please almost everyone and all the ordinary characters seem to be up to the task ahead. Now, if writers can just live up to what they started.
