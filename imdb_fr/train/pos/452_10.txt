"My child, my sister, a dream <br /> <br /> That everything would be good <br /> <br /> If we were in this kind of land to live together, <br /> <br /> And there slow and long love, <br /> <br /> He loves and dies among <br /> <br /> These scenes that represent you, this sumptuous time. "<br /> <br /> Charles Baudelaire <br /> <br /> According to Elizabeth Von Arnim's novel, "Enachanted April" can be described in one sentence ?? it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women and four foreigners decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. That's the correct description, but that will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - an ultimate film "feel good" is the perfection of the genre. Charming and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it's like a ray of sunshine on your face in the spring when you want to close your eyes, smile, stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. It's the movie that really affected my life. I watched it during the hard times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with sad and tragic events and accept an unflattering truth about myself. It helped me regain my optimism and hope that everything can be changed and anything is possible. I then promised myself that, whatever it was, I would come out of misery and self-pity and I would enjoy every minute of life - with its joy and sorrow ... I promised to go to Italy later that year, I did it and I was not alone. <br /> <br /> Charming, enchanting and comforting, "Enchanted April" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of the highest quality.
