"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast, exuberant and wonderfully entertaining Warners comedy that is sadly overlooked. Remember, if only for providing the official theme of Tinseltown - "Hooray for Hollywood". The score by Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer, however, contains a number of other gems, including the charming "I'm like a fish out of the water" and "Silhouetted in the moonlight". The best musical number is "Let That Be Lesson To You", in which Dick Powell and his company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves "behind the ball at eight", a fate that literally hits Edgar Kennedy, who is slowly burning late . The photo celebrates Hollywood glamor and punctuates it at the same time, as pompous and selfish actors and studio executives often make comic kilometers. The cast includes a plethora of great comic characters - Allyn Joslyn as a cunning press agent, Ted Healy as future director of Dick Powell, Fritz Feld as an exciting restaurant boss, Glenda Farrell in sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy sarcastically Mabel Todd, the awkward sister of Mona, and Hugh Herbert, his father even more awkward. The "racist" element mentioned in another review is a ten-second excerpt in which Herbert appears in black during a pseudo sequence "Gone With the Wind". His taste is questionable, but that should not stop you from seeing the other delights of this movie, including the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I believe to be the only available sequence on this incredible jazz combo . The sequence "Dark Eyes" takes a little too long and comes too late, but otherwise, "Hollywood Hotel" is a jewel that is well worth your time and certainly a film that should be considered for the release on DVD.
