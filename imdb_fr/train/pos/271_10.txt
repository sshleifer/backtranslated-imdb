It's all about Mitzi. I loved him in that. And does not she look fantastic ?! I love these popcorn movies from Sunday afternoon to life. It's like one of those nailers where they always go to the commercial at the most annoying moments. Richard's character was completely scary. I went out with guys like that. Well, not quite like that lol. I wish Zack was not killed. He was cute and very sweet to the eyes. I LOVE these stalker-like stories. It always makes me stand up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband does not usually like these types of movies, but in fact, he spent the whole evening with me and really enjoyed it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi will do next!
