One thing I can say about this movie is long, VERY LONG! In fact, I recently bought this movie a few months ago seeing that a new version was coming out. I was happy to see that it was made in 1978 because The 70's (although I never lived there) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! When I watched this movie, the story was very good at first, but after about 50 minutes, it started to become very boring and repetitive. I will admit that the animation impressed me! I had never seen anything before and it was pretty cool to see. but honestly, the film could have been a little better, it would have had a lot more words and stories than simple scenes of 15 to 20 minutes that had just quarreled. then, during the last 5 or 10 minutes, the film resumed and got good again, but ended unexpectedly. In my opinion, I thought it was extremely long. I know it's 13 minutes on 2 hours and it's still long for a cartoon, but as it was boring for most of the movie, it felt like it was 4 hours !!! but overall, it's a decent film, I suppose, and I'll watch it again during one of those "days with nothing to do". I'm going to see the new one and I hope it's better!
