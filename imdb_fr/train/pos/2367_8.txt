I could not leave the eyes of this movie when he appeared on a cable. Dialogues and costumes are of a quality that is easily associated with soft-core porn. In this case, the expedient conspiracy serves as a vehicle not for sex but for series of beating with nunchuks. (Maybe for sex too, but not on Indian TV, anyway.) <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of the genre, I could not put Jeff Wincott, and I do not. had no track to look for. It's only once Brigitte Nielsen traded her futuristic nurse's headdress (so much mayor!) Against the soft focus we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II, I made a positive identification about her. <br /> <br /> doubt all the admirers of the early 90s couture or schink-to-wink schlock at the Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for "so-bad-it-good"?
