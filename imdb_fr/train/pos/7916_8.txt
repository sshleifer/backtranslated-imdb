Well, well ... Roeg touched his nerves a little, did not he? He was a genius as he cataloged for several decades the descent of his various characters in psychosis, but as soon as he had the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) can be found in the bad old Catholic church, the crowd of alternative films hipper-than-thou becomes extra vicious. Even worse, the character of Theresa Russell - confronted with experiences that nothing in her rationalist avowal attitude has any explanation for - is reluctantly forced to treat these experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know, the domain of the ignorant and the superstitious, the kind of thing that art-house moviegoers are supposed to be above. Oh, the horror ... So, she's getting married again - the idea that it could be a capital commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like a divine intervention. People who find this idea offensive at first glance might be wondering why they are instinctively jumping into attack mode to be invited to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably will not do it. Of course, this movie has some problems, including the work of Talia Shire's delirious hamlet as an overworked nun, a 1950s style outfit and everything. And the dialogue between Mary Davenport and the young priest in their last scene comes straight from Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (although Hitchcock's film has escaped similar accusations because of the source of wisdom with impeccably secular references to as a Freudian psychoanalyst). Unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have been criticized as much for asking the question as for the possible answers presented by this film.
