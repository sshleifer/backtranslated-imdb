I am totally surprised by some comments on this forum, as well as by many critics. I think Tony Scott did a good movie here. Yes, it's very stylized, flashy and on the top, but it's a lot of fun. I'm happy at least that Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) <br /> <br /> This film may not be for anyone, but if you like comedy, black humor, cool action and dialogue, you should see it <br /> <br /> I've already seen Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - good movies, but I like this one Furthermore. It's like a roller coaster ride, with excellent selections of soundtracks, visual styles and at a time when all movies seem to be pg13, it's nice to see that someone is not afraid of the nakedness, bloody violence and has an explicit dialogue. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt that Keira is super hot, and even shows the nipples in it, either ...
