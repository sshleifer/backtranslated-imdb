Unlike Tellseltown's version of HELLO, DOLLY !, the screen adaptation of Broadway's blockbuster Broadway thriller, Ira Levin, could not wait for his performance to appear before posting it on the big screen. The producers have therefore wisely decided to make the most of White Way run! The opening and closing scenes of the film are shot in the intimacy of the Music Box Theater in New York, where DEATHTRAP played for nearly five years. Even the final fade of the movie on the theater marquee is a version of the famous logo of the stage. (Although marketers have decided to use the Rubik's Cube icon more fun for the movie.) <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP now looks as fresh and inventive as ever. The cast is right (better than their counterparts in the scene) and the local scouts should be commended for finding a scary enough house for our one-act, two-act thriller. Opened in a surprisingly simple and innovative way, director Sidney Lumet wisely labels all "new" material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves Levin's crooked and sinister center. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the film is a major Hollywood departure from the boards and lightly mine one of Levin's earlier narrative in the film [Helga (about a dagger): "Will be used by another woman BECAUSE the game was played".] Like Robert Altman's THE PLAYER, however, our new finale allows the film to fold back on itself and erase the boundaries between the scene, the screen and (could it be?) Real life!
