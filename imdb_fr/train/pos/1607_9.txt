As someone else has already said here, every scene in this film is a jewel. Most of the movies are lucky to have a perfect scene, but the director Jewison has hit home every time. The cast was perfectly interpreted by the excellent script. In addition, the musical parameters of the opera and other music of Dick Hyman were perfectly coordinated. Hard to imagine how they maintained the precise mood throughout the long production of a film. The comedy is subtle (most of the time) and the work of the camera reflects each emotional inflection of the story. Cher is such a natural comedy. Vincent Gardenia (whom I know most of all by his role as Frank Lorenzo in All in the Family, the unfortunate losers are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to congratulating this formidable cast.) Jewison has he already written about this film? <br /> <br /> I would love to read it.It's hard to understand why the average rating at IMDb is so low ...
