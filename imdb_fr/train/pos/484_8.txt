Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former senior chess player who was trying to return to a tournament in Italy. His genius is indisputable, but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who came to the same place as her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to find possible marriage partners. Vera leans towards a handsome count but, surprisingly, Natalia is more fascinated by Sascha, whom she met during a walk. Sascha is also taken with Natalia and offers the wedding at their second meeting. But, with the concentration that Sascha has to give to chess games and, with other events in his past that are still problematic, will he win Natalia's heart? Oh, and can he become the chess champion too? It's a beautiful film, based on a novel by Nabokov. The acting is amazing, with Watson very much as a beautiful and rich little girl, and Turturro perfect as shy and clumsy enthusiastic chess. James gives a pretty nice turn as a dominant mother and the other cast members are also wonderful. As for the look of the film, it could not be better. The landscapes are of a great variety, the period costumes are magnificent and the cinematography deserves applause. Yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, making it a movie that everyone will not enjoy. Then, the end is bitter-sweet. However, if you love romance, vintage plays, acting, great sets or the great art of movie making, do not miss this one. You will be defenseless by resisting his multitude of charms.
