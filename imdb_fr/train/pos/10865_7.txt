This movie is very entertaining to watch if you like organized crime movies. Those looking for a detective film featuring a charismatic actress dreaming of taking control in a bad way may be slightly disappointed by the way this movie is progressing. <br /> <br /> It's a crazy pleasure through a criminal world, however, and if you're not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you may be pleasantly surprised by it. I was somewhat disappointed by some of the historical choices, but overall it's a good detective film. Some things do not make sense, but that seems to be the norm for Eastern movies. <br /> <br /> People do things randomly, regardless of how their personality has been configured before. This is a slightly boring pattern that permeates even in this movie.
