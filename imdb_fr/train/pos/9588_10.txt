When Paris is Burning came out, I totally rejected it. I did not like the whole Madonna and Vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be campy and silly. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after ten years of film release and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of entertainment and excitement. I felt like I knew all the characters personally. The '80s were spectacular and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a great job! I went on the Internet and discovered what some members of the original cast were doing now, but I have not been able to locate them all. If anyone has information about any of the cast members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they will do another documentary. I LIKED IT
