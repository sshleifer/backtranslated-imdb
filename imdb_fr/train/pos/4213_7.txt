Director Samuel Fuller concocts a brilliant visual installation: an arrogant pickpocket unwittingly removes a microfilm from a woman's handbag; it turns out to be a mail to the communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police. The Black Film formula has all its brilliance - before the ingredients become clich√©s - including riparian areas, floozies, saxophones on the soundtrack and a fierce fight. The performances of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters go straight to the point, and the smart and clean scenario is quite colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter has been nominated for the Oscars for her role as "professional stoolie". Exciting, atmospheric, hard as nails. *** of ****
