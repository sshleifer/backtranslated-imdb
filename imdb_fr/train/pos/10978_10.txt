Several years ago, when I first looked at "Gray Gardens", I remember laughing and finding this hilarious camp. Years later, I still laugh when I watch it, but after many views, I came to see the beauty of the strange and twisted relationship between the inseparable "Great" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Petite" Edith Bouvier Beale . The mother and daughter who live together in the 28-bedroom East Hampton mansion add a new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic". With countless cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates, this aunt and niece of Jackie O. has allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles to visit their home to film them daily. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving tale of true love and the rule of anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie testifies to the indestructible bonds of love. And their lives are an example of dynamism, determination and free will. This film has more to recommend it than I can say. It's a rare experience that you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br />
