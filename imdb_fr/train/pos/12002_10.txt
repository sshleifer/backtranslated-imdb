Despite reading the "initial comments" from someone who, oddly enough, did not like the movie - (WHY THE ONLY THE NEGATIVE COMMENT FIRST ON THE LIST?), It was very nice to note that virtually everyone loved him! Clearly, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and portray the Prophet Joseph Smith positively - that's the whole idea. And in fact, these points have been extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... but in spite of that AND all the horrible negative attempts made by the adversary, it showed how much he was able to carry out a remarkable work, given by God. I would recommend it to anyone!
