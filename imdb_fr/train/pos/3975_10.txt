If you went through the '60s, this film can sometimes be painful and others very happy. Everything is there except the small print in the counter-culture tabloids that prevailed at the time. These are the roots of a social revolution that is always played out: "do not talk too early because the wheel is always turning, because it is changing." Although the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its diffusion at the time, this alone has played an important role in the evolution of the intelligentsia, influencing engineers, scientists and contributing to the extreme development of the activities related to the computer. Hi to the filmmakers of one of those who were there: you captured this era better than I saw before.
