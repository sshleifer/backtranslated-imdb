This film has its ups and downs, but for me the good things in this film far outweigh the disadvantages ... <br /> <br /> What is not so good in the film, it's sometimes the dialogue, the sounds, the lighting (am I the only one to have noticed that the decorations were illuminated in an amateur manner, and the actors' play .... <br /> <br /> What is very Well, it's the very original scenario, the very intense atmosphere, the factor that's very high, and the effects that are done supremely. <br /> <br /> So, it's really worth watching, or maybe to be even a must for all fans of horror and gore ....
