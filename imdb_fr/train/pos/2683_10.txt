Franco proves once again that he is the prince of surrealist and erotic cinema. While much of his work can be considered an entertaining film, but with Succubus (Necronomicon), he shows what he is really capable of when he lets his distorted creativity go wild and offers us a film both hypnotic and enigmatic while maintaining delirium. eroticism intrinsic to his work. Jerry Van Rooyen's beautiful score vibrates as the viewer is projected from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic or perhaps (as a mysterious character) to be a devil, an attempt to deal with the world she inhabits. A beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anyone, even passionate about alternative cinema.
