The title sequence shows the credits written on a rain-soaked sidewalk as people walk on it. the music is provided by someone who whistles Alfred Newman's Street Scene. Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be what his old man was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But he's pretty mean to a good guy. After several complaints of brutality, his boss, the insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), the retrograde. Foley tells him that he is a good man, but he needs to keep his head upright and look more like Det. Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden), who has just been promoted. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a superb slimy performance) has an illegal dice game and is looking to suck up the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), led by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She understands too late that her husband uses her as a lure and Paine hits her when she refuses to play. Knight Morrison steps in but Paine knocks him cold. This seems to be the worst, but later, the guy is dead; and Paine looks guilty. <br /> <br /> But it will not be Paine's story. Soon Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but not before getting angry again and committing a terrible action that he tries to conceal. Morgan's father, a taxi driver who has stories to tell (Tom Tully), could do well. It's up to Dixon to try to blame Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger conducts a script credited by Ben Hecht and three others of the novel "Night Cry" by William L. Stuart. It's a solid black film with excellent performances and all the dark photographs and morality we expect from this genre. It holds up to the very bright end, which looks like something the studio had filmed to appease the censors. Of course, the classic black directed by Preminger and starring Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You will appreciate that, but you can not miss it.
