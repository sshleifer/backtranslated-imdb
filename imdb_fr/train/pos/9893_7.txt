Poor geek Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is horribly burned by a cruel April Fools waterfall that went wrong. About ten years and the actors involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to horror fans for her turnings in Maniac, Faceless and the latest horror movie) to joke are excited for the next 10-year high school meeting that do not know that a masked court jester the killer is hiding in the school (now closed) and is seeking revenge. <br /> <br /> Chaulk this one up to be a guilty pleasure, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the characteristics of one. Yet there is just something about it that makes me feel obligated to watch it from time to time (preferably with a beer in hand). I'm even ready to forget the absolutely horrible ending (which, I must say, I hate it), I guess I like it because it has a fun atmosphere and makes some pretty cool victims. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager become both topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for women): a free shot of Simon Scuddamore at the beginning of the movie <br /> My Note: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional Track-Answers; trailer of this movie; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
