Holly addresses the issue of child sexual exploitation around the world (approximately 2 million children are trafficked each year) and does so with tact and without manipulation - a challenge that the team of Priority Films is very successful. American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together, they highlight what is commonplace for the people of the famous district of K11 Redlight in Cambodia. Although it tackles a thorny subject, the film keeps moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters closely, preventing the two-hour film from being too hard to watch. I'm happy that a film like this catches the world's attention to the problem. We must put an end to child prostitution and it is a very good first step. It's BIG and a movie that everyone has to see.
