I did not think this movie was as smart as it seemed to think but appreciated it nonetheless. <br /> <br /> It's original, although it reminds me a bit of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mainly for the coloring but also for the edgy quality of the close-ups of the characters. <br /> <br /> Placed in a jail cell but do not be discouraged, this movie apparently goes further than many multi-site blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with the perpetual 'Black Arts' in the foreground and a very good characterization making some too credible! <br /> <br /> Scary with a bit of gore it's well worth a visit.
