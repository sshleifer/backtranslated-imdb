OK, let's be clear. I'm really not in science fiction, but for some reason I like Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his SG-1 team through a stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. This gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like your usual sci-fi series, but it's not! The plot takes place today, not in a distant millennium, unlike many other sci-fi series. I think it's great. It gives you things, events, and events you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn a lot of new terms and names of all the gadgets. They do, of course, but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there are not many. <br /> <br /> The series combines action, humor and drama. If you like a lot of special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use a lot of bad but a limited amount of well done special effects.
