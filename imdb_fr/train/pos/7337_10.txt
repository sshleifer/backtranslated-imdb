Good story and excellent animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that's a good thing. Anyone who loves Conan the Barbarian or the game Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear even though it may seem that our hero is sometimes neutral. Most often, in fantasy movies, elves are usually described as having white skin and fair hair and goblins and orcs skin and dark hair. Anyone who knows the work of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows they are not racist. Anyone who loves fantastic movies should love this movie. This is not for young children because of violence and sexual innuendo. The casting was well done and the scenes and the music are first rate. I hope someone will soon put this jewel on DVD. I consider myself lucky to have a VHS copy in good condition.
