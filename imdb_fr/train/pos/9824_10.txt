This movie is a great example of the state of erotic B-movies: bad porn movies without hardcore sex. The plot in this one is not so bad that these things are going; she is a lawyer trying to prove that her friend is innocent of the murder of his wife. The rest of the film leaves something to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad woman, bad scenery, bad cinematography, bad sound and scenes of bad sex. Filmmakers should learn the difference between sizzling and erotic. They do not even have the common sense of having Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How is that stupid?
