I have seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will still be classics (like Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them, my favorite is this film (maybe it's not the best - but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I watched it on IMDb, I noticed that I immediately burst out laughing because the movie was terribly cute and well done. Marion Davies proved with this movie that she was very talented and that she was not the mistress of JUST William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> The story features a man from Georgia who goes to Hollywood with the hope that she will become an instant star! His experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the time make it a real treat for moviegoers and a must!
