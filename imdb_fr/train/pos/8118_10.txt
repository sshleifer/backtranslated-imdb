The film was first seen in 1975 on a German television channel and was hooked immediately. Then, I saw this film about 12 times in cinemas and, nowadays, I have a videotape that I watch at least once a year - this film is excellent in all aspects (direction, play, cut , sheet music ...). The sets are remarkable and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating world war beginning in the late thirties seems to be a prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "Everytown" is purely Mussolini and Raymond Massey is charming, credible and ideally interpreted as "the hero". The positive tone of technology and progress is quite refreshing by today's generally pessimistic standards - especially the final scene that always gives me one or two tears in my eyes, even after watching so often movie. <br /> <br /> This film is good on television but it's made for the big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see it in some cinemas. please, it's overwhelming.
