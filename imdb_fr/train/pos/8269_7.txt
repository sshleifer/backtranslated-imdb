This film intrigues me for a while, partly because of the extremely high score obtained here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 with over 300 votes gives it the highest score among all the silent movies available! How did I not hear about this movie before this site? Well, you can not always trust evaluations. It's actually a very good film, pretty well preserved if the good VHS transfer I rented is an indication - great acting from the main actors, including William Haines as Brown, and good filming work in Cambridge with some beautiful action scenes in the culmination of Harvard / Yale Football Match - but the story must have sounded like a horse chestnut even in 1926. This unpleasant, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and puts himself in his place, thus becoming a caring and sacrificing friend; I doubt that the people of 1926 found a lot of really exciting things in the last reels, the predictability factor is high. Nevertheless, it starts very well and certainly deserves to be remembered, if not praised in heaven. Maybe the last 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now over 600 voters and the score has climbed to 9.2! Seriously, my friends, he's stuffing himself with ballots - I challenge anyone to explain why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
