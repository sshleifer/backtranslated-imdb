"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" in tribute to a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all aged 15 to 17 in 1953. Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are engaged friends and jazz fans, blue jeans or anything that seems American. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship between teens is poignant, and finally a sacrifice is made to try to help one of the group who came across unexpected difficulties. Following the evolution of communist politics, they separate and meet in 1985 (the year before filming). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the film with some reservations. Subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially at the beginning, there were a number of dialogues that had no subtitles. Maybe the pace of conversation required it, but I could not always read the text or assimilate the scene, which made me not always understand what character was involved. I watched the movie (a video of our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This film about the coming of the Yugoslav age is well conveyed the sense of invulnerability, idealism and strong and loyal bonds of adolescents. There is a main flashforward and it was intriguing, leaving me guessing until the end which characters were vis-Ã -vis the 1953 cast, and what had really happened. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
