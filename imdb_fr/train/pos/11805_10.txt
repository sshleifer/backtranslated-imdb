Fragglerock is excellent in that Schindler's list was excellent. An excellent watch for children and adults of all kinds. Big noses can be seen as allusions to phallic symbols, just as H.R. Puff N Stuff had suggested that marijuana should be smoked. Your children will love this movie. I loved it as a child. My father showed me this movie when I was a child. He also took the opportunity and pointed out that exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although at the time I had no idea what it was. The film is comedy and adventure. The scenario is wacky and happy. You and I will enjoy this together.
