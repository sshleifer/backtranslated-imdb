Oh, yes, it's missing. intelligence that Paul Verhoeven is known for in his sci-fi films. I admire the way Verhoeven portrays the characters and their sense of humor, but unlike most of Verhoeven's films, the film itself does not have enough humor to fall into the genre of comedy. All of the actors were above average compared to most slasher movies. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not the story, nor the cast, nor the characters, but the amazing special effects that would otherwise make a movie. like this impossible. The crew has truly made an invisible man, without using objects such as a floating hat suspended from piano strings and other practical effects (effects made on the board). Scenes with the most amazing effects are not visible until Kevin Bacon is invisible. They are when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this story of an invisible man deserves to be more imaginative. Here, most of it happens in a laboratory. I would have liked to see the invisible Kevin Bacon rob a bank and get away with it, or steal something from people's purses, or something. But what is shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining film. Category B
