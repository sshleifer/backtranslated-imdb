A wonderful, fluid and often lyrical film that always makes you smile, even if there are really shocking incidents along the way. Women are stifled by the way they are treated and yet, in the end, they seem to be doing very well and it is commendable to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes work so well. This is probably the best performance of Depardieu, certainly the most natural. Jeanne Moreau plays remarkably well in a role that must have been very difficult to play and that includes vigorous sex scenes with two or three guys at least half his age. Miou-Miou is beautiful all along and still has very difficult scenes to play. At first, it sounds like a misogynistic and disgusting speech, but as the story unfolds and the characters unfold, a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end, this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.
