I thought this movie was great because Corrine and Sean are new to the business. It's full of action and a bit of romance, but there were times when Corrine did not speak very clearly (when she threatened Sean with I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were very well portrayed , and there was an obvious contrast. Also, because I watched the next star of the action, I'm sure Corrine and Sean did his own stunts, which were very well executed. I'm looking forward to seeing another movie of the couple, because they make up a great team, or maybe a sequel to your life, maybe called "getting fat in the big apple", this could be this time about Carmen ..If your life is EXCELLENT!
