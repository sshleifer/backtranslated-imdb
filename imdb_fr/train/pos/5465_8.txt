This is a hard film of Warner Brothers starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck portrays Lily Powers, the beloved daughter of a violent big city owner in a suffocating steel city, playing the Machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in "Double Indemnity". She became cynical and numb after being offered for years as sexual favor to her father's clients. Once her father died from an explosion in a distillery, she boarded a freight train bound for New York and literally slept on a bank scale. work here. With his lost gaze and his methods of amorous seduction, it is easy to understand why men become dependent on his aggressive charity. One of the young men she seduces on the way is a fresh-faced John Wayne, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama becomes heavy towards the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a job in Paris to keep Lily silent and the new president of the bank, so addicted to Lily, that he diverts the funds of the company to keep it. luxury. A sharp end is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwyck lights up the screen. The film has curious touches like Lily's friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches him Nietzsche's philosophy about the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
