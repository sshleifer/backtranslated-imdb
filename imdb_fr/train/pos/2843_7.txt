If you're not in the mood for more than an hour, this movie might give you some variations. What I like are the surprises in progress. It's not just once that you want one or more of the short films from "New York, I love you" to be pursued. Some short films intrigue you, some are very short, others longer, others have definite ends, others do not. <br /> <br /> Most stories present the sad side of the capital. It shows a lot of different nationalities. Many of them give the same impression as when, once, I went to a capital of other countries for a year, where many people came from different countries. The project explores many types of things you may have known, but for all your characters, this is a new thing! Some of you may have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new and meet new people; Feel dreamy, sad, but the kind of sadness you are looking for, because you are so bored that you were at home. You may want to relive it, watching this.
