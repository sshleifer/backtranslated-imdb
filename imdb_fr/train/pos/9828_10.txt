I'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie. This is a great zombie movie full of action, original ideas, good acting, but also bad effects of zombies. The fourth part entitled "After death" is also valid. I would recommend this movie to horror fans around the world. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this should go to The Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, The Slumber Party Massacre, Away Camp Sleep and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
