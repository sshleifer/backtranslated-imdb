A family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) go out for a family reunion in an isolated house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This angered some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and everything is going very slowly (VERY slowly). <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started looking at this. Most of the reviews on this site are extremely negative. Well ... I do not agree. First of all, it's not a horror movie. The horror does not even begin until the last 30 minutes. He plays more like a family drama with elements of horror. At this level, it's damn good. <br /> <br /> First, the bad things: the pace is WELL too slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actor. Too many fake dream sequences are frightening; the wendigo barely appears in the film and the unobstructed view that we get from wendigo at the end is laughable. <br /> <br /> The right material: A very good dramatic scenario; Clarkson is excellent as a mother; a good direction with strange sound effects that are a little scary; a pretty explicit sex sequence between Clarkson and Weber (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot!); very good role play of Sullivan (only 10 at the time!) and Speredakos and a tragic end quite unexpected. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are annoyed by this movie because it is portrayed as a horror movie - which it is not. So, if you can ignore that, I think you might like it. I give him a 7.
