"Written on the Wind" is a melodrama by Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by the "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc., who hailed him as a great director. I think it's because of the sophistication of his cinematography. "Written on the Wind" offers sumptuous color images and sumptuous decors. But I wonder: is it enough to wear a movie? The game in "Written on the Wind" goes from weak to righteous (with the exception of Robert Stack - he is convincing as a weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, usually very present on the screen, is misinterpreted in this film. Dorothy Malone as a seducer, the carefree "femme fatale" is fine, but she lacks strength for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient but tasteless. <br /> <br /> The plot contains some very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A rigid patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by the disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustrated and her nymphomaniac babe Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a principled woman, former secretary and now married in Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought together with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets behind the door, love triangle, frustration, fist fights, laughs, death, etc. - Well, when I read the summary of the story on the back cover of the DVD, I thought I was dealing. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "Written on the Wind" is taken seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before, the acting is usually not enough - it lacks intensity. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors are just doing an effective job. I think that perhaps with Italian or Spanish actors these scenes would have been completely explored - they would end (for us) by an explosion of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> What we have left is Douglas Sirk's beautiful cinematography. For me it is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
