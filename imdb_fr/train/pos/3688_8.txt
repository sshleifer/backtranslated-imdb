Delicious movie directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film also presents some of the great actors of our time, not only of France, but of everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14th District: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and get an idea of ​​her life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: There was probably no better way to start this film than with this segment devoted to romantic Paris. <Far from the 16th: an image of Paris that we know better since the riots of the cities. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's child (nanny) than hers. <br /> <br /> Latin Quarter: the pleasure of seeing Gerard Depardieu as the barkeeper with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Eiffel Tower: Do not tell me you did not like these mimes! <br /> <br /> The Tuileries: what a pleasure to see Steve Buscemi as a tourist who establishes privileged contacts (no) with a girl in the subway. Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is awesome. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this film makes me want to go back! <br /> <br /> Seen in Barcelona (another big city), at the Verdi, on March 18th, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
