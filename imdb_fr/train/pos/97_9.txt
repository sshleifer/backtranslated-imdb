It was a Christmas special that I wish I could publish on vhs or dvd, because my 33 turns were lost and all the tapes I made also left for a long time. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big John. Denver fan, but was very impressed by the music, which was mainly a traditional favorite with a muppet effect (especially Little St. Nick!). It also contained some little known songs (original?). <br /> <br /> Even though it was done in the late 70's, this show had a timeless atmosphere. Hoping to find a copy soon !!!
