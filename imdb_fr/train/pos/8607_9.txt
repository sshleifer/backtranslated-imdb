I have never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song has always been treated mercilessly - not just by their detractors, but by almost everyone. For me, "I Married an Angel" is more alive and imaginative than all the more famous outings of the duo. The sets and costumes are as sumptuous as in a MGM musical, the script is written by the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), the Rodgers and Hart Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for "The Wizard of Oz") gives celestial treatment to celestial tunes (albeit slightly modified by the usual MacDonald-Eddy Bob Wright and Chet Forrest). in their contemporary clothes and seem to have fun with the weird procedures. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Lovers" to the uninitiated today and they might very well have trouble sitting, but this quirky and fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain.
