I could not believe the comments made about the movie. <br /> <br /> As I read the terrible opinions on the film, I wondered if you had actually watched the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> What I saw was amazing! I think the actresses and the director did a fantastic job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I have never had the pleasure of seeing any of the actresses before and I could not have been more upset about the amazing work I would have had to say is the most credible movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> What I do not see is why everyone has a problem with the choice of Deanna's drug in the scene of the suicide attempt. From the comments, it sounded like it was the choice of actresses and his stupid choice. That, I do not understand it, it's a movie written by someone else and made by someone else, so how is it that the mistake of actress that I do not see not. I think it was a real credible movie that I would see again and recommend. Opinions are what they are and it's a pity that so many people are so close to mind. I hope to see all the actors soon. I think everyone has played a big role. <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps will one day be the best paid actress and I hope she can laugh in the face of all those who criticized her! Go, girl!
