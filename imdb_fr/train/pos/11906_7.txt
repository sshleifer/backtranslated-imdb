This schlockmeister documentary, William Castle, takes some inexpensive shots in the naive environment of the 1950s-1960s in which he did his most characteristic work - look at funny and stupid people with ghost glasses - but he's also affectionate and animated, with particularly brilliant comments from John Waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and Castle's daughter, who adored his father and who is also quite insightful about how he has exercised his talent. (We never know what happened to Castle's offspring.) The films were not very good, but their marketing was brilliant, and he seems to have been an adorable and hard-working family man. Fun people continue to make their appearance, like Diane Baker of Straight Jacket, who looks great, and Anne Helm, which she replaced at the instigation of the star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman explodes with laughter remembering the happy memories of working with Castle in "The Tingler", and there are enough video footage to give us an idea of ​​Castle's level of talent - not very high, but very energetic. A pleasant look at a time when the audience was more easily satisfied, and this makes you nostalgic for simpler filming days.
