Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie! I did not even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the son of the main characters. It was an excellent experience and I loved every minute. During the shoot, they needed me to be in two places at once. So they used my twin sister as a liner! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car does not belong to him. I always act and do television, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is the first at the top of the roll. <br /> <br /> Summary: I thought the film was fine, but if I was not there, it would not be one of my favorites. I thought the acting was really good, but the scenario was not great.
