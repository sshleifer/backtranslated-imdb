Maleficent is a very interesting film. It is an impious combination of triumphs and failures. The central concept is great: three inmates with strange personalities are joined by a fourth (to which the public identifies) and they try to escape from their cell using a magic book they find in the walls of the cell . <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is well woven, it reminds me of the reading of the stay in prison of Edmond Dantes at the castle of If (before becoming the Count of Monte Cristo). The director gives the impression that the characters are related to the cell, especially the character we are supposed to identify with (Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it is indirectly suggested that would be a fraud). On one occasion, Carrère relaxes leaving the cell to exercise and is closed the door; we never leave the cell, claustrophobia is intact. There are also no shots from the prison outside the cell, and the view through the bars is a sunset on a generic prison wall. So even though the film seems to be very modern, it has a very old sense of incarceration in the world. <br /> <br /> The characters intrigue. We have Marcus, a violent preoperative transsexual who plays an abusive mother of Daisy (a young man with intellectual disabilities). Daisy likes to eat everything he finds beautiful and, unfortunately, that included his little sister, hence his current situation (I like this comment on internalisation, very primitive). Lasalle is an elderly man, retired and possessed, for murdering his wife brutally. <br /> <br /> The central message of the film is that your desires will annihilate you and that there is a ritual that goes with it. I think that's what bothers me the most, to see people destroying themselves ritually. It has a real life. The fairly simple soundtrack confirms that, each step forward in the quicksand is accompanied by the muffled sound of a gong. I hear gong now whenever I do something self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think that one of the problems of the plot is that the extremities of the characters do not really reinforce the message in a coherent way, especially with Carrère, the concept of the book also seems to change everything at the same time. along with the film, not in terms of successive revelations. I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more by design than by execution, like the famous "vaginal eye" and Lasalle's sodomy, for me totally empty images. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we have the impression that the director is in a hurry to finish, and some things do not seem logical, for example, we have been clumsily led to believe different things on the child of Carrère. That does not change the fact that what we have here is this rare bird, a "pure" horror movie. There is no comic dross or discordant genre, like Cube (1997 / Natali), the obvious movie to compare, it's a total immersion experience, where you feel like you're in the cell with characters. This last comment I make on the fact that it is a "pure" experience, in my opinion, is something that others have also mentioned. So it's a fairly unanimous point. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, my favorite part of the movie is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. He describes very clearly a scene in which he goes to work one day and sits in his usual place in the center of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. The books seem to tell him that he will never contain their knowledge. This makes Lasalle go crazy. This is really the problem of an obsession with understanding and knowledge. This is something that I myself have felt. <br /> <br /> A final comment is that two of the very well received comments on the board confuse the names of the characters. To convince you that Lasalle is the former librarian, just click on Philippe Laudenbach's page and you will see that he was born in 1936.
