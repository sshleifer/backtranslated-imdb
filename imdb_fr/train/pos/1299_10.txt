I caught a little of this concert on public television and I knew I had to have it. The boys give everyone at the Royal Albert an excellent performance, often exciting, complete in every way. Pure too - no synths, no smoke-wrapped lasers and stroboscopes, no grand entrance (and an astonished, serious and grateful audience, all of whom left their bottles at home). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Cream (or if you've only heard about it); if you are a fan of blues; if you are a fan of rock 'n' roll; you will not be disappointed when you watch and listen to this DVD. In addition, you will never lose this DVD because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get theirs!) It's too beautiful and too replayable. you will want to keep it handy.
