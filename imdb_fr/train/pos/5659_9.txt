AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller so rare for American television. Sheriff Lucas gave the willies to many spectators. We sought Caleb to resist Sheriff Lucas' attempts. We became preoccupied and fearful when we learned of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that the weekly made fear what Lucas would do next were really surprising. This show lived up to the nickname "Gothic" of the way American entertainment has so rarely attempted, let alone mastered. The costumes certainly made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show shames the current glut of "reality" programming that is so unsatisfactory as ever. The call to a DVD box is well founded. This show is a quality view for an enlightened market that is hungry for quality viewing. A public tired of an overabundance of agonizing prices in reality will welcome this jewel of the true narration. Bring the DVD box!
