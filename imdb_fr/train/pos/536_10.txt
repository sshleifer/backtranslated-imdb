Few films can be seen nearly 60 years later, but remain as captivating as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. The special effects used are remarkable for a film of 1946. The acting is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do a remarkable job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are aware of it. It's my favorite movie of all time. To wait and hope for the release of this film on DVD for so many years is, in itself, "a question of life and death".
