Among the first five episodes of Hammer's "Hammer House of Horror", this fifth episode with the wonderful title "The house that blew to death" is probably the scariest. A big fan of Horror's gothic films from Hammer Studios for many years, I wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the show quite recently. So far, I have only seen the first five episodes and I feel that the best is yet to come, but even if the series remains as entertaining as the first five episodes, I will be satisfied. While the second and third episodes were interesting to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is unquestionably that of the first five that delivers the most authentic Horror. The episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife for unknown reasons. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) move into the house with their granddaughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). Shortly after moving in, however, the family must discover that there is something terribly wrong in the house, which is apparently haunted ... The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his previous mediocre entry, "Growing Breads "(Episode 4), and the relatively unknown actors offer good performances. The film is also well done in terms of effects, cinematography and scores. "The House That Bled to Death" is a solid episode that provides the elements that my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in a Short Horror story. The film offers a frightening atmosphere, real moments of fear and intelligent twists, and is full of suspense and very entertaining from start to finish. Overall, this is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
