I saw that many years after the television series and at first I did not care. Then, as my memory of the show dissipated over time, I looked at it again and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on Neil Simon's play, he was not much "open" to the big screen, and that's one of his strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant in the role of Oscar and Felix, and the supporting actors are wonderful, especially John Fielder in the movie 'Vinnie'. Even now, some moments can make me cry with tears - Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a football game with a request for dinner, Oscar cracking and chasing Felix around the apartment, the "Pigeon Sisters" chuckle muted by the bloody stories of Felix and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene (later ripped off by Nora Ephron's When Harry Met Sally). Dialogue sharpened too. When the boys think Felix has overdosed, Oscar says, "They could be vitamins! He could be the healthiest in the room!" Fantastic!
