I am in favor of any film that depicts a lush image of Italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, exceptionally for a period piece, and a bit skinny on the cinematographic aspect. However, the excellent story makes up for it. The four ladies embark on a much needed relaxing vacation with problems in mind. Over the course of the film, they realize their problems and begin to solve them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle in which they stay, has an enchanting effect on people. "It's a bath of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can witness the gradual change from their dissatisfaction to their exuberance as the Italian littoral applies their magic to them. <br /> <br /> All their problems and solutions are plausible. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very appropriate for a romantic Italian venue. In all, a 10/10 movie for me.
