When this movie was released for the first time in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest bands of the moment. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was little more than a video clip. The acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians playing on the big screen for the first time? Despite that, it was still a very entertaining movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton offer a classic comedy of all time, especially their rendition of "The Password", which will make you think of Abbott and Costello playing their first baseball game. <br /> <br /> Appolina (who wore only one name at the time) provided beautiful breasts, so you covered the brief nudity. Plus, she is very attractive. And of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later had problems with Warner Bros. He changed his name, but at this point in his career, he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie does not rank in the very early super category, but it's pretty amusing.
