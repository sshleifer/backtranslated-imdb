Weird horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines (later "Flamingo Road" on TV) as a pretty but a little unstable with a gummy smile that has to pay for her suicide attempts by protecting the Gateway to Hell! The scenes with the Raines modeling are very well captured, the background music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming like Cristina's girlfriend, but when Raines settles into a scary brownstone of Brooklyn Heights (inhabited by a blind priest at top floor), the kitchen really begins. Neighbors, including Burgess Meredith, a nasty super villain, and Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, a nasty couple, are evil and Eli Wallach is very entertaining as a police detective. The film is almost a cross pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Inspired by Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, "The Sentinel" is an entertaining spooky movie, full of shocks well underway by director Michael Winner, who makes a thoughtful late-night out with talent. *** 1/2 of ****
