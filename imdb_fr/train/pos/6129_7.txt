Note that I did not say it's better ... just nicer. The absence of social commentary and realism helps to move things forward. <br /> <br /> I was kind of surprised that it was not a Troma movie, because it contains all Troma trademarks, including acid sputum, naughty after every murder, a scene of ridiculous rape in the bathtub (quite difficult to upset because the rapist is a snowman) and dumb deputies. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, about whom it is pointed out to him that he has neither legs nor feet, drives a police boat in town. <br /> <br /> 2. Even though it is supposed to be close to freezing (or below), no one is blowing and nothing lets out the exhaust of the car when it is running. <br /> 3. Snow is more like polystyrene flakes or peanuts than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenager is angry at her boyfriend just hours after her brother's murder. She convinces him to force his way into the sheriff's house, wherever he is, to bring him in. But first, she tells him that he must light a good fire in the fireplace and open wine. <br /> <br /> 5. When a teenager, Jake, has his head cut off, his father chats with the sheriff to find out if Tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. The sheriff argues that Tommy would not have fought with Jake because Jake "is at least two feet taller than Tommy". At that moment, someone in the background rings: "Not anymore!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the bad snowman finally starts to melt, the sheriff fights with a flat snowman made in some kind of fabric for a long time. It's much better than Tarzan fighting with rubber crocodiles or gladiators fighting with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I could not have kept my face straight at this point. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a funny movie. There is not really even a lot of blood.
