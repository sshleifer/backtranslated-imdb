"Most of us live in at least two worlds, the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the inner world, the unconscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With these words, M Gone introduces into the world of "The Maxx" a fascinating world where fantasy and reality combine. Inspired by Sam Kieth's comics, "The Maxx" is very faithful to the material in which he was inspired, not only in the story, but also in the graphic style, which resemble the pages of the comic book, giving it show a surreal and unique appearance. But also, the story is interesting and fun. At times, it can become too strange, but when you enter it, it's hard to get out of it. The story and the characters are wonderfully developed. The music fits perfectly with the style of the show and gives it an appropriate atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this one was short lived. "The Maxx" is a must. It's one of my favorites of all time.
