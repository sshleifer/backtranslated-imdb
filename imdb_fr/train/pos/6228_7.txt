Another fun and witty musical from RKO with Astaire and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming movie. Even if it lacks the great airs of SWNG TIME (although the last issue "Face music and dance" is one of the best and rightly of the team), it is extremely enjoyable because they could hardly do anything bad the 1930s Once again, the plot is light and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is a real paradise. These two conveyed more romance and magic in the dance than many couples of films in a huge love scene. While there are better Fred and Ginger musicals, it's definitely a must.
