Perhaps the most refined and successful of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the pitfalls commonly associated with Bollywood film (ie Tackness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of themes / genres Western movies). Pakeezah is native to the subcontinent and authentic, almost like a butterfly in his plot. The characters are well developed, the direction, though sometimes unrefined by current standards, insightful and convincing. Urdu-speaking circles in Pakeezah's day were masters of the understatement and the way in which dialogue reflects the subtleties of the time! The acting of the actors (especially the "looks" and the dynamics between the characters) is a pleasure to watch although the nuances can be lost for the contemporary television viewers or those who are not familiar with the manners and the customs of the Muslim India. <br /> <br /> Coupled, with a captivating storyline is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist displaying an eminent mastery of Indian classical dance (kathak). As in most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not take leave of the audience without the viewer having the feeling that he / she has already participated in a memorable film experience. Pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled.
