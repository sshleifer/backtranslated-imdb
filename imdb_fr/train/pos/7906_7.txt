Gus Van Sant has made excellent films. I am really a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can not help but think that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins' book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in translation on the big screen. Only Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and talented tricks. In the end, it just did not work. <br /> <br /> This is not because the characters are not well developed or the plot and content are not alive. It's just that our imagination is much more powerful when we read a book like this. We are taken to a different place and time and we sometimes think of the worst and / or the best. This adds to the roller coaster of the book to the extent that it unfolds perfectly according to the accuracy of the author. However, movies can leave someone with less imagination and emotion, which is detrimental to the overall experience. That's what I think happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
