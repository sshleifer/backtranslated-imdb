Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful supermodel. She lives in her apartment with lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon). She has attempted to commit suicide twice in the past: the first time when she was a teenager and her father cheating on her mother with two women at home, and then when Michael's wife died. Since then, she has left Christ and the Catholic Church. Alison wants to live alone in her own apartment and with the help of real estate agent Miss Logan (Ava Gardner), she finds a beautiful furnished apartment in Brooklyn Heights for a reasonable rental. She sees a strange man at the window of the top floor of the building. Miss Logan announces that it is Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest who lives alone and is supported by the Catholic Church. Alison settles in her new workplace and receives a visitor: her neighbor Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith) greets him and introduces his new neighbors. Then he invites Alison to the birthday party of his cat Jezebel in the night. The next day, strange things happen with Alison in her apartment and with her health. Alison searches Miss Logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. Further investigation shows that all the people she knew in the evening were dead criminals. Frightened by the situation, Alison kisses Christ again, while Michael investigates the terrifying events. Alison realizes she lives at the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Although underestimated in the IMDb user rating, 'The Sentinel' is one of the best horror movies ever made. I saw this film at least six times, the first time in the 70s, at the cinema. On September 7, 2002, I bought the imported DVD and saw it again. Yesterday, I reviewed this film. Even after so many years, this film is still fantastic. The scary and sinister story is scary even nowadays. The cast is a constellation of stars and starlets. You can see many actors and actresses, who became famous at the beginning of their careers. Fans of horror movies certainly revere 'The Sentinel', and I am one of them. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sentinela dos Malditos" ("The sentinel of the damned") <br /> <br /> Obs .: On September 2nd, 2007, I saw this film.
