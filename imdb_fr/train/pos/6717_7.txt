This documentary was very complete and revealing, and at the same time entertaining, which seemed to me rather impressive. I felt like they had covered the sport from the very beginning to the present day, but there is one reason why I do not give this movie a high score ... <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the story was sometimes too centered on the "proper names" of the sport, so to speak: too much on individual sites to surf, and especially too much on individual surfers. I felt that the documentary had more to do with the nature of sport, the ideology of sport, and so on. It would have been better (although it was covered, of course, I do not think he had the time he deserved). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not absolutely ferocious surfing, it can be boring to hear them constantly. Although the video clips and the extensive research are well respected, they could have been presented in a way that would be better for those who are not passionate surfers. <br /> <br /> In addition, my biggest disappointment was the time they talked about the extraordinary and miraculous that some events in the history of surfing were not yet, they did not have the sequence actual events unfold, and all the time you wait to see on the big screen this amazing and amazing event men talk like life-changing moments, and in the end all you get is that many men speak about it, not the images themselves. It was too tempting for me to hear these stories and not be able to see them later. I understand the difficulty of getting images of everything, but I beg you: do not brag about an event, but do not show it. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very recent documentary that I liked to watch; This is not the best documentary for the reasons mentioned above, but as it is very recent and it contains extremely exciting sequences and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that I would advise everyone to watch.
