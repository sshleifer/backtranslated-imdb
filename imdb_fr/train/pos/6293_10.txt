Buster shines absolutely in this episode, which is the only vehicle I saw towards the end of his career that allowed him to do the physical comedy (and silent!) That made him famous. It's always a shock to hear his rocky voice in the walkie sequences - his voice is pretty much the only thing that matters to me, as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to deal with the breakage is always unmatched. He even repeats some of the gags used in his first two tourniquets with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting this episode and for giving Buster's genius a whole new dimension. He did not have much time (an episode) to do it, but it's a moving tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
