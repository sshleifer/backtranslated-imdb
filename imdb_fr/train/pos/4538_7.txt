I did not even want to watch this movie after reading Maltin's reviews and 1 1/2 stars. I looked at her on the advice of my son and I found it much better than I expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars on a 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand everything. If you do not know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I had my high school diploma the year of the film's making, so maybe I can understand better. Yes, there is a pretense in the film and it's weird to a certain extent, but it was the 70s so what are you waiting for. I can see why people might not like the movie; However, I can not understand people saying it's boring. The film is anything but boring. You will hate it or love it. If you find this boring, you are probably dead brain.
