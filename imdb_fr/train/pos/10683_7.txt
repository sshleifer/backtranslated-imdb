It's a better than average silent movie and it's always worth it if you're a fan of silence. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other movies before watching this one. This is because the plot just seems old fashioned and hard to believe in spots. But, despite this, it's still a good movie and it kept my interest. <br /> <br /> A nice lady unfortunately found herself with the wrong man and ran away to marry her. The film begins five years later after she realized he was really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to make the most of it and not dwell on the quality of her life before this jolt entered her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich woman whose husband tries to negotiate a deal. Unfortunately, the lady with whom they were trying to meet a potential customer for a dinner could not go and the seamstress is generously paid to be the man's rendezvous. Like Cinderella, she cleans pretty well and the man loves it! What to do now - since she is married and the new wants to marry her ?! Well, see the movie yourself to see how everything is solved. I did not like the way they treated the husband because it seemed terribly predictable and clich√©d. However, once it's been eliminated, I really admire how the film did NOT give up a final in numbers and left the film with some outstanding details. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very good movie to see, but certainly not great.
