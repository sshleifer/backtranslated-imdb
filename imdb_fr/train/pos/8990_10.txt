The film is about Anton Newcombe. The music and careers of both groups are just a backdrop. It's just that Newcombe has the last word about the movie, which you can find in the "news" section of the brianjonestownmassacre website. I would link it here, but IMDb will not allow it. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are limited by what the camera records, as well as the need to gather a coherent narrative from somewhat random occasions placed the lens of the camera on a line of sight with relevant events. In Dig !, Fortune smiled on the Dandy Warhols, claiming that they had become pop idols, while they were making smooth pop for mass consumption, including "Bohemian Like You," a song that was a favorite worldwide thanks to an announcement on a European mobile phone. <br /> <br /> No luck for the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The film captures few things that have made the original BJM scale funky, with the sole exception of a one-minute, unique set-up, showing Newcombe the creation / recording of brief, instrumental, remarkable parts in itself, and concluding the sequence by reading the lush, shimmering sounds that must have been in Newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world. <br /> <br /> Three comments accompany the film; one by the filmmakers and two by the band members (the BJM track is only former members and without Newcombe). The Warhols and BJM alumni view this montage sequence as the "best" part of the film, and I agree that, given that the film is focused on Anton Newcombe, this is the only part of the film who correctly illuminates his purpose. gift, and seems too brief to strike a fair balance to this attempt to portray the "tortured artist". <br /> <br /> What's interesting about the comments is that, unlike the movie, they're recorded in real time - a long shot - that can be more honestly telling than a documentary that takes shape mainly by mounting. <br /> <br /> The Dandies do not show themselves well in their comments. If the world of rock and roll extends the experience of high school life for its inhabitants - as I believe it - the Dandies are preppy types obsessed with popularity, those who listen to rock because that's what they do their peers, while the BJM crew presents itself while the half-exiled and half-exiled outsiders (to insiders like the Dandies, the "losers") constitute the true rock spirit. BJM's Joel Gion, who speaks MUCH, tells me the message of the film when he says (paraphrasing): "You can not forget that Anton was able to do the only thing he ever said he wants to do great music. "<br /> <br /> The Dandies, for their part, laugh too easily at every scandalous show during the collapse of Newcombe (all BJM sequences end here in 1997, before Newcombe leaves the heroine). Courtney Taylor-Taylor summarized Newcombe's commitment to her vision. "He is 37 years old and still lives in his car, you can download all his work on his website, he was so fed up with being ripped off by giving it all, he could make a mint." to hear him shake his head in disbelief. <br /> <br /> The defects of the film can not be attributed to the filmmakers; it is rather the difficulties of the documentary form and the loss of cooperation of the subject of the film that make this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary. But it's probably the best we can get, apart from his music. <br /> <br /> I only rented a record, which has this function. Most extras are on record two. I do not rent this, as I already ordered in my order.
