Very funny. I went with 8 friends to preview this film in preview. We came to see another one, but after 10 minutes we wondered how we were stung. The jokes became funny and they remained funny throughout the film. In the first part, you just keep asking yourself about this kind of 'malinski' and 'bellini' (there are many more examples of this jargon) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists), they become more and more fun. In search of this malinski, all the main characters are presented the first even wackier than the next. Until half of the movie was over, we did not even know the name of this movie because there was no opening credits and we went to see this movie, but we had a lot of fun. The house was full (about 250 people) and I think about half of them did not like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange movies with good dialogues, you'll love it. Apart from Clooney, this movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 IMDB score it had when I write this, but when more people have seen it, I'm sure it will increase. 7.0 is reasonable, I suppose, I would give it a 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
