It's a slow-paced film, slowly building the story of an old stripper who begins a new family life with a stranger. The viewer slowly gets the impression that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really liked this film even though it leaves a slight bitter taste at the end. It's smart, well paced and very well played. Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply attached to their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very touching. <br /> <br /> A thriller that does not seem to be one. A very unconventional film, a very special atmosphere throughout the film even if you can feel embarrassed several times with some scenes. <br /> <br /> I'll give him a 8/10 !!
