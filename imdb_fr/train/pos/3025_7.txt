Bacall is doing well here, especially since it is only his second film. This one is often eclipsed, because it is between two great successes: "To have and to have" (1944) and "The great sleep" (1945), which associated it with Humphrey Bogart. Admittedly, this one is not up to the other films, but I think it's not his fault. I think there was some confusion in having her portray a British lady. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were entertaining - Boyer was definitely not Spanish. It was difficult to know which country were the inhabitants. <br /> <br /> I really liked black and white cinematography. The mood is used to a lot of effect - I particularly liked the fog scene. Lighting also adds a lot to intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is simply beautiful. Boyer just does not fit into the main role of the romantic man - so Bacall and he were a bit strange. No great chemistry - and certainly no magic Bogie and Bacall. But I have always loved this picture. There is a lot of tension and it is going well enough. I must say that I found the murder of the little girl quite audacious for this period film. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as a secondary cast. Paxinou, as owner of the hotel, is absolutely naughty and perverse in his portrait. Her only scene where she laughs maniacally while Mr. Muckerji leaves after exposing him to the murderer of the child is quite disturbing. Lorre is also doing very well in his murky snake portrait of Conteras - a sleazy coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix is ​​also very good at representing the child Else - especially since it was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (although she looks much younger ). It turns out that she later married Auie Murphy, who turned out to be an ephemeral and stormy marriage.
