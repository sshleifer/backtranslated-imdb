"Eddie" was introduced for the first time by "across-the-pond" friends who know that I love intelligent humor. I prefer comedians that one can think of while entertaining while entertaining, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In 'Dress to Kill', Eddie offers the same kind of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject while causing your side to split at the same time. There is a wide range of topics in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. The piece on how to choose Englebert's stage name will leave you in the assault! <br /> <br /> Thank you Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
