I really enjoyed that. I thought it would be a documentary, but it turned out to be a good language to amuse the cheeks. <br /> <br /> I think it was done well, about a long TV show in a movie, but because of the willingness of the characters or the original actors to have fun and have fun , this work is of great purity to the old innocent style. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the original TV series, then I'm sure you'll enjoy that. <br /> <br /> Q
