When people ask me why I like movies so much, I usually say, "did you see the sequence of the art gallery in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" This scene alone is about everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a director, that would be the kind of thing I would like to do. "Pure cinema" is a way of describing this sequence, and it is truly amazing to see how De Palma's entire film works at the same artistic frequency of this scene. It is a dreamlike film, as smart as hell, and with more zeal and intelligence than a dozen films together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be the subject of lively discussions: can a film rely solely on technique and be considered an artistic success? The film has no message, the acting is great but it is at the service of style and the scenario lacks logic. De Palma's film is a very good example of how style, when handled properly, can be used in a feature film. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative performances, but this is a director's film to the point. This is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of film support. I will not tell you which Hitchcock movie the film pays homage to (I do not want to spoil the surprises), but I think De Palma transcends the arc of history and manages to create a film that pretty much sums up his whole career. . Not for the faint of heart!
