It was really good for a low budget movie. I put this well above your average B-movie action. Sean and Corinne intervened in this film and they did not seem to be afraid of the camera. Watch the cameos of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think the producers would have even considered it, but the finalists deserve it. <br /> <br /> I hope Sean and Corinne will be more involved in the film entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed very authentic, and Corinne's sexy character was rather hard and sharp. She was well connected to the action sequences and executed with confidence. It was a great idea to make Billy Zane the smart and witty villain. His charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane's character and Sean's was pretty good. The action sequences were not lame and seemed to connect throughout the movie. Of course, there were flaws, but that comes with the territory. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was designed for television. Sean and Corinne have done a good job considering that they are new to the sport. I hope that Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star cast will have the chance to join their co-stars in the success of the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: *** / ****
