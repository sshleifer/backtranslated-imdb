I saw "El Mar" yesterday and thought it was a good movie. It begins with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. After that, we spend about 10 years in a hospital where the 3 friends meet. <br /> <br /> Religion, disease, love, violence and sexuality rage throughout the film, creating an intense and energized film. <Br /> <br /> I see people complaining that the movie is too bloody and I think they missed the purpose of the story. It is a violent, intense and sad story. People should suffer. Cry. To hurt yourself. Bleed. And I think what the film shows, is not made for a pure shock value or presented in an unpleasant way. I know that some people like their "clean" movies, even those that contain violence. But sometimes, a movie should make you feel uncomfortable working. This is one of those movies. And a good movie is. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I noticed was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details of the plot were not clear at 100%, and only after thinking about it end of the movie, everything made sense. But the story was not very important, so I give a 9 to this movie.
