It's a hilarious film. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who has signed a sponsorship deal with Ned Beatty Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract contains all sorts of humiliating clauses, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken costume during the race! Jim Nabors is his chief mechanic (not quite convincing). Beatty has assigned Loni Anderson (oh yeah!) To keep Reynolds honest and to scrupulously respect the contract. It's a funny movie in which Burt proves he's not too proud. I love it!
