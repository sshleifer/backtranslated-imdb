When you usually watch a short film, you are always afraid that the creator of the film is trying to say too much. This is not the case with this one. A beautiful story about a girl who has enough and about other mundane forces trying to help do things right. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari does a remarkable job representing the twisted sense of justice and helping to understand the complexities of the A blurred line between good and evil. <br /> <br /> The girl and the father give great results in this wonderful short film, but Eric's show is without a doubt the thief of shows in this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this film for its complexity, performance and excellent sense of history.
