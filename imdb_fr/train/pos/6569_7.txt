"Jake Speed" is a good movie with a wonderful message. He has his faults, of course. Sometimes it's a bit slow. He introduces his villain too far into the story. Its action is punctuated by the rhythm of the heartbeat of a snail. He has a grade Z cast (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who has the good appearance of Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all that going against it, "Jake Speed" is really inspiring, thanks to a charming screenplay by Wayne Crawford (who plays the lead role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> Why is it so inspiring? Because it tells me, "Hey, why do not you try to be a good person?" <br /> <br /> The story is essentially a "foreigner in a foreign country" premise, that is, Jake Speed ​​is good and heroic placed in the real world where bad things happen to the right people. Jake is more than a scout. He is more than a knight in shining armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, evil and evil world. <br /> <br /> It is for this reason that "Jake Speed" really had to be a success. It contains an excellent message that should have been broadcast in Hollywood, then in the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that really cares about portraying good and honest people. I'm not saying we should be watching Walton in all theaters in Cineplex, but it would be nice if more movies like "Jake Speed" had a chance. ("Due South", a TV show about a Canadian policeman, is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Of course, "Jake Speed" has violence, the blood and firearms. but the general message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you will defeat the forces of evil every time. 14/10/99
