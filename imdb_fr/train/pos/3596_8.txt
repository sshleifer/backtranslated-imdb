I finally sat down and saw this movie throughout the movie, and I must say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my favorite new actresses - it's not just that she * can * play, but that she chooses the roles that suit her best, that are more meaningful and important than which would seem at first sight. I read a few comments expressing their relief that it was not a terrible feminist thing, as they previously thought, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself, contrary to what everyone around her thinks (except her caring brother Tiny and her coach and director, Hector, who turns out to be more of a father figure) than his true parent). the word "feminism" is all about it. It's nice to see movies like this showing the true side of feminism - they're not a bunch of losers - but they have dreams and can do it all. Diana is true to herself while falling prey to love. She and Adrian have a more realistic and complicated relationship than something that happens magically. Girlfight is a real taste of reality and has given back to my perception of people. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important film that concerns not only young women, but all people who want to go far in their lives.
