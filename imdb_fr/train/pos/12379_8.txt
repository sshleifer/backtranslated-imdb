I was an usher in an old theater in northern California when this movie was released. As good as on DVD, it is even more strange and terrifying on the big screen. Although it's been around 9 years since I saw it, it's still one of my favorites. At the risk of seeming banal, "They do not do it anymore!" If Sixth Sense has panicked you, this movie is definitely for you! Great scenario, incredible character distribution, disturbing setting; even the soundtrack has a haunting quality. I strongly recommend that you do not look at it alone. What a brownstone apartment rented in 1977 alone will make you gasp (that would be at least 10 times this price today).
