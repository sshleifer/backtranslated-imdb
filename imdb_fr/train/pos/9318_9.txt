Red Skelton is yet another major star who has successfully transitioned from film to television. <br /> <br /> His shows have certainly made Americans laugh in the past. <br /> <br /> start the show with an opening monologue. Then we would have a variety of characters. Do you remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red? I remember an episode where, as a king, Red introduced his queen by calling it your size. <br /> <br /> Go know that Red would use his comic talents to hide from his tragic life. He lost a son with leukemia when he was about 11 years old. His wife, Georgia, committed suicide.
