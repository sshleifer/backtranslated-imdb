My dog ​​has recently died. It was a movie I loved being a kid. So I had to see him to try to cheer up. <br /> <br /> (Watch out for the dog, I mean Spoilers.) This movie is not just for children and it's far from ordinary. It was held in New Orleans in 1939. Above all, the dog was not described as an additional member of the family in this film, but as an adult with his own complicated life to manage. <br /> <br /> In his early days, Charlie is not much different from his dishonest and brutal business partner, Carface. He is motivated by money, greedy and has just escaped the death row, as he says at the beginning of the feature film. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others; Anne Marie and his sidekick, Itchy. Carface will not even listen to the big ugly dog ​​with the big glasses that happens to be closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carface is trying to murder the hero because he wants 100% of his company's profits and do not settle for 50% - a very unusual way for a German Shepherd mix to die. In addition, being eaten by a prehistoric-sized alligator that ends up saving your life because you know how to sing is very unlikely, whether you're a dog or not. It's a caricature, that's why it's logical here. <br /> <br /> Carface's method of revenge is murder, while Charlie believes that success is the best revenge, financial success. After surviving his death, he starts a business by taking the funding source of Carface, a very talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win many races, and Charlie tells him that he is going to give the money to the poor - hint: Charlie and Itchy are living in a scrap, and so are poor. He uses the money for his casino / bar / theater and not for the other "poor". Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals because she has compassion and listens carefully. She teaches ethics to Charlie by showing him that he plays, that he lies and that he steals. Charlie tries to catch up by buying his dresses. She added the ethics that her company needed, while Charlie was in charge, and Itchy ensured the construction. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to destroy Charlie's business, which is not protected by the government. Charlie loses everything and he only has that little girl left. Finally, he had to choose between his life and his. He first took the watch to protect himself and put it on when the girl started to sink. The girl and the watch were sinking and he had to choose which one, and he had chosen the girl. <br /> <br /> The big part of this film that focuses on a person's ability to learn good from bad over time and a child's ability to cope with natural death of his pet is that it never shows anyone's death! The watch symbolizes his life, and the watch is immersed and stopped. All the dead were suggestive, even for the wicked. So far, I have not cried during this film, and I have shot so much more than I had to write it and share it with you.
