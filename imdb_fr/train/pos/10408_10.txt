I saw this movie for the first time when I was little and fell in love with it. The sets are breathtaking and part of the scenario is perfectly hilarious: "You, son of a thousand chips". <br /> <br /> It's always on TV late at night or very early in the morning I woke up around 3 am once and it had just started. Television stations need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time on Sunday so everyone can have the chance to see this great job. <br /> <br /> 10/10
