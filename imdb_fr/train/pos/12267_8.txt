Tintin was one of my favorite heroes when I was a child. I used to borrow books from the school library whenever I could. My favorite was "Red Sea Sharks" - lots of action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant presentation of the story of Herge and her development of Tintin. The filmmaker's personal experience in his interviews with Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who inspired the character of Chan were very moving. <br /> <br /> A great documentary about a very talented and appreciated artist. . An excellent example of someone who has gained international fame and brought the joy of millions of children (and the youngest at heart) around the world.
