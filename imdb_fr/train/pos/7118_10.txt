It is a great classic film of the 40s and well produced. There are very dramatic scenes in this film with John Garfield, (Al Schmid), "Force of Evil", '48 and Dane Clark, (Lee Diamond), "Last Rites," '88, fighting the Japanese during the Second World War being completely encircled. and with a single machine gun. When Al Schmid was able to return home after being hurt by a horrible injury, his problems began to begin with his family and committed girlfriend. Dane Clark played an exceptional supporting role in the role of Lee Diamond, who did everything possible to help his friend Al take back his life. There is never a complete victory in the war and let's not forget all the brave military personnel wounded in hospitals for veterans of all wars and our Iraqi veterans!
