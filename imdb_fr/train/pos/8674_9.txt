This is a typical case of Tom and Jerry: a situation is conceived, a conflict arises and chaos ensues. The characters behave appropriately, the natural tensions between the characters lead to general chaos. The most interesting part (and the funniest part) takes place when the peace treaty is in force and respected - all kinds of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning: It's unwise to let Tom help you do your morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended.
