While I wanted to watch this movie since the first time I watched the trailer, I had a deep surprise with this movie. Although some elements and actions of the characters seem a bit too caricatural, the dark character of the film makes it a very different experience. Instead of the story of the well-being-happy, this film takes you in another direction that is uplifting, but also disturbing. Most children will not understand some of the darkest moments of the film, making it more watchable for adults. I was also impressed by cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and flip-flops. The score is solid again, which proves that Hans Zimmer is the essential specialist in the field of animated scores. I never thought I could say that I enjoyed the music of Brian Adams.
