This film must be one of the most beautiful, moving and stimulating films. It's a good entertainment for the family and at the same time, it makes you think very seriously about the problems involved. Whenever I see "Zac's ghost riding the bike in the puddle at the end, I can not help crying my eyes. John Thaw's performance is so touching and it's a pity he's no longer with us. forgot an exceptional movie.
