Kim Novak is a witch looking for a lover of mortals, and James Stewart is his choice. Glittering comedy of morals, of the Broadway scene; shot by James Wong Howe in Witch Color, and played by an outstanding cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as a perpetually disheveled writer, Redlitch. I love this movie, even if few others seem. Kim alone makes it a winner in my book. Ha! My film n Â° 5 of 1958.
