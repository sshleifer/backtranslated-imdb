Writers Perry and Randy Howze have written a very engaging story in "Chances Are". <br /> <br /> Recalling a reincarnated man returning to his ex-wife's home several years later, the plot turns unexpectedly and delightfully. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, twenty-four years old, Jr. performs a delightful performance, brilliantly assisted by Cybil Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has good chemistry for this caper, playing each other with a graceful style. I watched this movie several times on TV and every time I found it very enjoyable.
