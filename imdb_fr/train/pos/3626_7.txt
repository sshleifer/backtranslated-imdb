This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, high school science teacher / baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to get into the pros game and realize his dream of playing in major tournaments. Dennis Quaid, a sports film lover, interprets Morris with enough conviction that his role is effective and producers are able to credibly reconstruct the real-world events that led Morris to a brief incursion as a relief thrower for the unfortunate Tampa Bay Devil Rays. . The first half of the movie, about his group of High School Baseball players (who all look too old to be in high school), is less effective and probably a bit too long. Overall, the film suffers from rhythm problems and some additional secondary intrigue that we probably could have done without. However, it's still a pretty engaging movie with an inspiring theme that proves once again that baseball is the national hobby for a reason. CATEGORY B-
