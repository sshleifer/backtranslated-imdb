I saw this film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival, and I had the privilege of meeting both directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are lively and frank New Yorkers. The title of the film in Amsterdam was "Keep the river to your right", which somewhat lessens the sensational aspect of cannibalism. Tobias Schneebaum had romantic and homosexual relationships with members of the groups he had studied as an anthropologist. His reunion at almost 80 years of age and his inevitable holidays were very moving. I can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story, far from being pedestrian.
