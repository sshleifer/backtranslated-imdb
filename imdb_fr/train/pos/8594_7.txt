The Sentinel I was hoping to be a good movie and I was right. A beautiful story first taken from a novel and I thought it was an original story, but I guess it was not the case and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland too, but it's very difficult to take off his role of Jack Bauer in 24, but you finish it well and he is very different from The Sentinel compared to 24. He's also Eva Longeria.It was not very good in the movie and had a back seat in the whole. After watching the movie, I always dreamed of The Sentinel and I could not sleep.Overall Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
