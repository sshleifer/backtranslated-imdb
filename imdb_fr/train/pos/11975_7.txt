Full House is a great family show. However, after watching several episodes again and again, I realized that they were incredibly boring and that they seemed to be shielding themselves from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly old-fashioned. It's not like I hate it, but just do not look at it again and again because they're getting old fast. The best season is probably the first. <br /> <br /> Full House is talking about widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and her three daughters, D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. So, his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and the uncle of the girls Jesse (John Stamos) move in with them. Once they live together, they realize that they can not live one without the other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you how important family is and you can always go home.
