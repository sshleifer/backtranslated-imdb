This independent DV function, in black and white, shocks, amazes and constantly amuses with its ability to create the most senseless situations and then find humor and interest. All this is hilarious and ridiculous, but as absurd as the film can be, there is a heart and a reality here that keep the film on the ground, prevent the whole piece from sinking into complete madness and that's where the true message. This film tells how we all survive in a crazy world. This seems to be the heart of the film. As crazy as possible, Leon, 30 years old. old paperboy protagonist, always try to keep it together. He is like a child who is always trying to catch the balloon that floats so that everything works for the better, so that everyone can have what they want. <br /> <br /> The action in the film could have gone far but the exceptional distribution really keeps the cohesion of the piece. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the group here with a performance that shines through his absurd and sick tics. As the movie characters do, we forget his sudden explosions to see the real person underneath. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a real genius here. It takes the most ridiculous twists and keeps them real. It's his script and cast that help keep everything afloat. It's a real testament to the skill of Majkowski and everyone involved: this film, with its intrigue and characters, never works our nerves once. Majkowski took a film that could have been abrasive and disgusting, and gave him heart and humor. It's a unique film. Do not miss. <br /> <br />
