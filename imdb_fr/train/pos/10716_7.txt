I'm watching this on the Star World network overseas buying American and Canadian one- and two-season shows like The Jane Show. I thought about the number of female comedies that I'm able to watch for myself, there's Lucy, Bewitched, I Dream Of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes blank, I can not think of it to no other, women all play a supporting role and not the main role. So for me, the Jane Show is in very good company. One thing I just thought about though. I watched several movies made in Canada and I do not remember anything that was filmed in a regular TV series that features SNOW! Everything is done at the height of summer, LOL! While it's a great place to live in the summer climate, but you think, they would show Canada a little bit in the winter, because that's part of the lifestyle too. I mean, SCTV, Just For Laughs comes to mind as two long-running comic series in Canada where very few, if any, are filmed with snow, even though they're doing a lot of scenes in outside. I move away from the subject, but I laugh a little while watching Jane and his visibly liberal ways of being accused of racism towards his neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his madness, I found him tied with a British series entitled The IT Crowd (I Think), another office comedy with a female role. Not at all the best comedy of all time but for a guy to say he can look at him alone, that's saying something. If I was with my wife, she could really enjoy it because it's about office sex and stuff like that, so it could be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 out of 10
