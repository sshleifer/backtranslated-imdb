A quirky and rather entertaining sleeper about two very different brothers who are not only so-called "firelighters" (imagine Stephen King's snoring book of a book of the same name), but also always disagree with a woman who has the bad habit of being an arsonist! Good special effects (especially towards the end), unusual performances by a trio of talented actors and a really interesting and strangely appropriate soundtrack finally make Wilder Napalm a unique treat for a movie to watch .. if you can find that! On a personal note, I was lucky to get it back (so to speak) in the two dollar bins of my local video rental store. (*** out of *****)
