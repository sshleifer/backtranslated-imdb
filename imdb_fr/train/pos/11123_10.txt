Greetings from this Portuguese. <br /> <br /> I think the Sopranos are one of the best productions of all time. They mix reality and fiction so that it is difficult to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini goes like a glove to paper! I would love that the Sopranos never end at all. It's perfect! This should be a subject at school :) I saw sopranos when I was a child, but I was too young to stay awake until the end of the episode. So I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I watch them all at home before. and after dinner, I get hooked, as I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best television series ever made. The arguments of both are splendid and the actors are perfect. Congratulations for such work. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my english. Thanks for reading.
