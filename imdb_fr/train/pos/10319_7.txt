After reading many other reviews of this movie on IMDb, purists seem to agree that this movie is nothing like the books on which it is based. On this point, I can not comment, having never read before any of the adventures of the protagonists. However, what I can say with certainty is that it seems to me that many of these reviewers have surely suffered a bypass of humor; Let's be honest here - this movie is so much fun! <br /> <br /> OK ?? .. then I must admit that the film is apparently not representative of the character (s), but let's put this in a clear perspective ?? .. do the same people who are talking about this movie also deplore the fact that the 1960s Batman series does not stay true to the original comic character? Or maybe there are STILL worries in the same people as the 1980 version of Flash Gordon in the movie is a break from the original series? <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is incredibly camp, but charm! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Ely, plays the role of the eponymous hero (and looks more like Gary Busey!) and is backed by a support group that seems to want to have a ball with their respective roles . Also look for a very brief but very welcome appearance of the favorite of horror movies Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Far too many, but take a look at the server's hilarious facial expressions when Savage and his men make the ultimate faux pas of ordering coca, lemonade and milk on a formal occasion! Also the scene often noted towards the end of the film where Savage approaches his nemesis, Captain Seas, using various disciplines of martial arts labeled on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> In simple terms, the film is not taken seriously at all and is all the more fun. Very fun from start to finish! (and you'll sing John Phillip Sousa's adapted theme song for guaranteed days!)
