I saw this film in sixth grade around Christmas and I was really excited to see it. And when I heard that George C. Scott was in, I was really excited, because I really like George C. Scott! When my class and I were watching this movie, I was really in the movie and when it was finished, I was really impressed, I thought it was totally fabulous! It's the best version of Charles Dickens classic novel I've seen so far! The performance of George C. Scott as Scrooge is something else, I thought it was the perfect choice, it was Scrooge, it was the definitive Scrooge! I saw two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other with Patrick Stewart, but it's the best! <br /> <br /> What's really great about this is the acting, I thought the actors were fabulous, everyone was, minds, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, they could not have found better than those. they had the roles! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw it, I thought it was the absolute best! Ebenezer Scrooge, it's definitive, I do not think they could have found someone better! I do not think they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the definitive adaptation of Charles Dickens classic, and I really think you will agree, you will think this movie is fabulous! I will probably have to buy this movie on DVD because I thought it was totally fabulous! I totally recommend you to see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
