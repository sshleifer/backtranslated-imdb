Well, it's really different from everything Lynch directed. No supernatural substance, no violence, no blasphemy. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful film. It's a little slow but maybe it's intentional because it's the story of an old man's six-week trip (that's what I think best for his duration). The characters are ordinary people and they are therefore credible. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Everyone who has a brother or sister can understand it. Lyle and Alvin have nothing to say. For a moment, they are back in the old days and all fights are forgotten.
