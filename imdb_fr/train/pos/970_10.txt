Today, I saw a lot of movies during my day, but there were very few that were very good for me. And I am 16 years old and I am impressed by this film aimed at a younger audience. It is a very underrated jewel for those watching foreign films. Almost all actors are credible, the graphics are correct (for which you will not even care when you watch the movie, believe me, it would be stupid to get excited about the graphics), the story is well written and C is a movie that everyone can enjoy, not just children. <br /> <br /> Basically, that's what this movie did to me. It's one that made me laugh ... a lot, two, that made me feel the characters as you suppose, and it's a very uplifting story. At the end of this movie, you will feel good. Of course, what anime there did not see a young boy become a great warrior and anything to defeat a great evil. It is a formula that is used a lot. But, in this case, it is forgivable, because even if they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics that you would see 5 years ago, their appearance is not to judge. It's very touching, the end is original and allows you to stay in the film as it should. If you try to compare that to other movies like "The Never-ending Story" or whatever it's going to change, it will diversify your opinion. Look at it as it is and you will appreciate it. <br /> <br /> I have not been impressed that way for a long time. The only other movie where I had this feeling is when I saw TMNT a long time ago when it came out. There is something in this film that I felt about TMNT that really made me love. So, do not over-analyze and do not take this movie too seriously, enjoy it.
