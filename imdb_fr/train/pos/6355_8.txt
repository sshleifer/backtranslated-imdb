I had already loved "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released and I still love it so much, 5 years later. Many people still seem to disagree with my opinion and this film has never really received much love at the time of its release. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is sumptuous and campy but for the same reason is also why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All sets, costumes and characters are superimposed in a fun way, without ever becoming ridiculous. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's a camper movie at its best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this funny little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey in the role of Grinch. He really wears the film with his good and funny role. He is of course helped by his compelling composition, which also received an Oscar. Of course, if you're an enemy of Jim Carrey, you should not even think about watching this movie. This film is really his film and it makes it all work and so much fun to watch. Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as young Grinch also play other fun and memorable roles. <br /> <br /> The film has a good morale, but it is a bit dark for me. It may be because I'm Dutch and we do not really celebrate Christmas as enthusiastic and big here as in the United States or England. For me, the movie was just fun and entertaining and the mood left me cold enough to be honest. <br /> <br /> The musical score of James Horner is good and fun, even if it's your daily average in Horner, it still works perfectly for the film and helps to make some of the work of the stage. <br /> <br /> Perfect entertainment for Christmas. <br /> <br /> 8/10
