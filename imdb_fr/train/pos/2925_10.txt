During Edie Murphy's turn, a public woman shouts after Eddie and a man from the audience answers him. what is said is, women - DO MR ROB (it's a live Saturday night character), meets the man with SHUT UP BITCH. unlike the previous post that said that the women had shouted not to eat hair, it is incorrect, although the post-er said he was there, he must have a hearing problem! despite what the post-er says about not being able to read it on DVD, listen to it carefully, as you can hear on the DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this will help anyone curious to step out of the exploded joy! !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
