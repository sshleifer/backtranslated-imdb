David Duchovny plays the main role in this film. Now, many people who discover this fact would not even bother to watch it.Very unjust, it's the least we can say.Avid has made himself known on x files and is a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict doctor who has been struck off for malpractice. By simple accident, he becomes a private doctor for criminal billionaire Raymond Blossom.However, the FBI is closely interested in Eugene to trap Blossom. Angelina Jolie plays the lead role of clare-the gangster moll.She achieves a solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immerses himself deeply in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as one might think and in the end I would say his performance is believable. His familiar monotonous tone and impassive face are present, but do not interfere too much with the film.
