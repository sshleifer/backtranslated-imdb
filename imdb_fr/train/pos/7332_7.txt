I watched some footage of this film when I was a child, but although I immediately buy the Blue Underground set because of its limited edition, I'm only doing it now - and that's mainly because the POP American from Bakshi (1981) has just arrived on Italian television late at night (see the review of this film below)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found the film very epic as an animated epic of witchcraft with particularly impressive backgrounds (rotoscopic rather annoying characters were, it is true, less) , with a drift if derived Goal. The plot, again, was not entirely original, but it proved undeniably attractive and the main characters quite well developed - the naughty ice lord Nekron and the enigmatic Darkwolf warrior are particularly interesting. the hero and the heroine, however, are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta describe the well-endowed girl (her bra can be torn from one second to the next) and half naked to start (her panties are eternal) disappearing in her ass)! That said, it is clearly an action-oriented action and it is certainly a problem (the one in which Darkwolf is particularly savage); The final confrontation, even brief, is also well managed and sees our heroes ride pterodactyls attacking the den of villains in a cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, with the exception of the Frazetta funds mentioned above, the main recourse This film is for me now a factor of nostalgia, because it brings me back to my childhood not only watching films like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but also animated TV series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (1983-1985). <br /> <br /> With regard to accompaniment, THE MANUFACTURE OF "FIRE AND ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> A featurette vintage on the sword-ritual animated film that is only available via the washed-out VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! He discusses in detail the technique of the rotoscope and also shows several examples of live "performances" (in a studio) of segments of the script - which would then be drawn, merged with the background and filmed. Yet, after watching many of these behind-the-scenes reports on the art of animation (on Disney Tins and Looney Tunes, for example), this is not a very convincing piece ...
