it is by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I have ever seen on screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of endangered man. he sees the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in a good way. his purity, honesty and kindness clearly exude when you watch him work in momentary works of art that are as simplistic as they are full of life. I was amazed at the patience with which he created his pieces and his patience. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor brilliantly conceals his disappointments. the film is shot with elegance and contains the same flow as the art of Goldsworthy. it combines nature and art in a minimal way, as such. Fred Frith's score is organic enough to mix everything without interfering with the naturalist sound. It's an excellent job overall. there are no boundaries as far as age is concerned.
