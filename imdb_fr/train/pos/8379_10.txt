I remember this movie of when I was 12 years old, it was amazing .. I remember it until the day when it was not most of the things I had watched at the time, I I even tried to buy it but it's like a rocking horse sh * t! Anyway, the acting is a bit chewy, but the story is amazing considering that it was a real B-movie with a small budget and that the fighting scenes were incredible to watch. It was a very well done film and I loved the idea of ​​fighting robots controlled by a giant man. Too bad they had to spoil him by making a crappy scenario of "Crash and Burn", do not look at this film by its total! If you're a true fan of sci-fi movies, watch this movie, if it were redone today, it would be a winner. I would really love to see a remake or even take out a DVD.
