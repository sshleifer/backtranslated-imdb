Directed the same year as "Vertigo", this film is just as mesmerizing, but in a vein much lighter. It takes place in an enchanted New York during the winter: Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell on James Stewart, but is caught instead. What is interesting is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, the origin of Madge's role in "Picnic" on Broadway (the role that Novak would make famous in the cinema).
