I managed to record this on my satellite, but I would like to get an original version in a format that we can use here in the United States. Eddie is really glorious in this performance of San Francisco. I do not remember laughing so much in a standing routine. My wife and I enjoyed this tape and her work on Glorious. I wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially with my purchase. We need more of his shows available.
