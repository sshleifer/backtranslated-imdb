When will people learn that some movies are made for pleasure and are not necessarily ready to change the world? If you realize it, expect to have a lot of fun while watching "Bill and Ted's bogus trip". It's a very funny movie to watch. Keanu and Alex form a fantastic team that reproduces their characters from "The Great Adventure of Bill and Ted" with even more style in the manner of the first film. It's not rocket science, but it's great to laugh, the characters are extremely capable and the scenario is so radical that we have to laugh. Do not expect deep and meaningful words, expect pure pleasure!
