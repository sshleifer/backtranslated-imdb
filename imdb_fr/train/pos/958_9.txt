Wow! I have seen so many bad budget movies lately, but this one is great. The very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the East German coast contrasts sharply with other films or criminal series. I loved the lead actress and the absolute rejection of any clich√© about the police. This film is realistic as a documentation and entertaining as one drama at a time. A perfect compromise!
