I am surprised that many viewers have more respect for the rest of this brilliant film ... I saw all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best. <br /> <br /> Even though I have already seen the "making of", I still have doubts when I look at these 35 minutes of pure torture: it's as powerful as that. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 because this film has perfectly achieved its goal: to be the best fake snuff film of all time manufactured.
