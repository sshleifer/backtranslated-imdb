A recent screening of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT made me want to watch many of MGM's classic musicals from the 1940s and '50s. ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a film of lesser quality than ON THE TOWN. The songs are not so good, nor the chemistry between the characters. But the film mixes wonderfully classics such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl, with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above, then going down the steps, while dozens of pianists play at the piano, is the best scene in the film, even if the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music lovers will undoubtedly identify the music played by pianists. Sinatra then believes: "I fall too easily in love with me" before having his epiphany on whom he loves. The color is beautiful, Hollywood is pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air (can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, not to mention the mid-1940s ?!), and the music on the piano is absolutely glorious. MGM certainly had the gift of creating lyrical moments like these.
