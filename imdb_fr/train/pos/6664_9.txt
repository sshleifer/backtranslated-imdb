I just do not understand why this movie is being beaten up here. Jeez. It's stupid, it's not polite and it's (as I read it) wasted on some people. The actors of this movie play their characters in front of the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a fan of Ben Stiller, then you will be disappointed). They are misunderstood and well-intentioned misfits who try to save the city / world with courage and determination. The problem is that they do not realize their limits before the big confrontation and that's the goal! This is 3 times the movie that says The Spy Who Shagged Me is still treated by the same demographic, probably the same people who feel pale compared to the first AP movie in relation to the sequel. I just do not understand. Jokes work at more than one level; If you do not get it, I know where you are.
