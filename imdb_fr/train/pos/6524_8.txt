<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate movies, the American history of New Orleans / early 19th century, or by Yul Brynner, watch this movie and make your own own idea. Do not be put off by various mediocre reviews. My reaction was that it's entertaining, well done (usually), that he has a very spiritual dialogue and that he does a great job in describing the charm, the attraction and the legendary fascination of the privateer Jean Lafitte. Although not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me a successful historical film?), I think the film deals with the role that Lafitte played in the history of the film. New Orleans and hates the relationship between the "respectable" citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. Do not worry about what the movie does not do, but watch it for what it does, that is, for its study of one of the most intriguing historical characters in New Orleans and the United States.
