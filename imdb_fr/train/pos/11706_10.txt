To all the critics on this page, I must say that this film is worth the detour. So, it was made in 1972, and then. The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of his time. People who have not studied the culture of decades would think that this movie is a ball of cheese. Compared to the modern series, "Left Behind" (which is done for our time right now), it really looks horrible. However, the only crazy aspect of the film is fashion, which goes back more than 30 years. BUT. The message sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved. There is so much to say, but I refuse to say it. (for fear of spoiling it) So go see this movie! If you do not like the message that it sends, then you have problems that need attention!
