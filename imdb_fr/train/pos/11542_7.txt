The first time I saw that, I did not laugh too much. At the time, I was only about fifteen years old and I thought that the deepest mood was perhaps too ripe for me to understand at the time. I had the same reaction when I saw it a second time a few months ago, and this time it was because Felix's failed suicide attempt at the beginning of the film made the film a little darker. . This scene gave the impression that some of the things that Oscar said and did to Felix later in the film are desperately needed, and the personality conflicts that unite them were not as amusing as they could have been. be. If I had not already known the story, I would have feared that some of the antics of Oscar to Felix push him to the end. As things stand, it did not make me laugh or smile like the TV show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Anyway, it's a very good movie that gave birth to one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10
