Kate Beckinsale is as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie, although I liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other version of Emma. They are both good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale like Emma seems more interesting, almost, though. And I liked better the woman who played better Harriet Smith in this film ... she was softer and more sentimental. There are some things I like best in Gwyneth Paltrow's version, however, as how the humorous side is more apparent.
