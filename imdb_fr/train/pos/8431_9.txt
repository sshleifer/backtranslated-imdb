You have not seen this movie? You have not even heard of this movie? That would not surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio has had confidence in the image and has never been picked up for a major release. The independent company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited circulation with virtually no promotion, and the majority of the big movie critics did not even bother to review it. I suppose that a film based on a single act, a play about apartheid and its impact on two individuals has never really had a chance in today's market - and that is the loss of the amateur of smart movie. <br /> <br /> Angela Bassett and Danny Glover both deserved to be nominated for Ocsar (as the director of photography), but the film has received such a fanfare that I can not even blame them for 'academy. It's a difficult film that provokes reflection and heartbreak, and it actually asks the audience to meet him on his own terms. Given the above, this is certainly not a film for a senseless entertainment. Director John Berry is not trying to dress Athol Fugard. Of course, we've had some fractured flashbacks and breathtaking shots, but the BOESMAN AND LENA film version remains, in the main, a story of two people living in inhuman conditions. <br /> <br /> Stripped of their fundamental rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) no longer have to attack each other. A third character joins them for a while (Willie Jonah, amazing in a largely silent role), but the film never turns away from the title characters and what they have become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances like broken torque, performances that simply could not be improved. Stimulating vigorously and brutally intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to be rediscovered from the personal video. Without question, the best film of the year 2000.
