This showtime movie really deserves an audience rating much higher than that of a 4.5; I gave him a 10 based on the story and the game of two stars. After reading the comments from the viewers, I was surprised how many people expected this film to be a comedy. Yes, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy / Drama under Genre. It's surely deceiving, is not it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before connecting to this website, so I did not have that expectation. In fact, based on the summary of what I heard, I was really expecting it to be just a drama. I wonder if the disappointment that it was not a funny movie caused so many weak votes. <br /> <br /> Another factor that could have caused weak votes is that this movie is really "character-driven". "Driving Miss Daisy" is an example of another character-centered movie that comes to my mind. The previous comment of someone complained of a boring lawsuit. Tom's work scenes (Danny Glover) seemed to distract from the real plot of the film. That is, how he organized the ascending social ascendancy of his family - or his personal troops, if you will. However, they served to establish the credibility and the justification of his right to settle in Greenwich and to move into the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession has become a constraint. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend in with the white district. His sorrow when another black person moved next door was not due to the color of the skin. It was because of everything the "intruder" represented; everything Tom had left behind him. To sum up, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: black on the outside but white on the inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this film are among the most powerfully written, directed and played (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have already had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the highlight of the movie was not the obvious event that happened next (I do not want to reveal it). The climax is verbal and whoopi the book. I still do not know if it's the conversation when she informs Tom of the college that Tom-Two will be dating or when she releases him, all in the middle of the night and Tom waking up. Nevertheless, the outcome is great. You know that life in this street will never be the same again. <br /> <br /> My favorite character-oriented type of film: people go through problems, feel pain, dance, grow up, change, and life goes on. As a member of the audience, I can learn something or be inspired.
