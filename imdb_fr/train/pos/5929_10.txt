Stephen King was raised in movies like this one. -Flicks NOT movies. <br /> <br /> Films like this one and 'Jeepers Creepers' are a "throwback" for the good old horror movie in the car. They are supposed to be fun, cheaply made and hopefully with some good alarms. <br /> <br /> Anyone looking for a theory about the human condition should convey this characteristic of the creature because that's it ... never. <br /> <br /> Stop trashing what has already been thought of as a basket. -Well, fun, garbage! <br /> <br /> If you liked, I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers' '' Jeepers Creepers 2 '' '30 Days of Night '' 'Scarecrows' (88) 'They live' 'Planet Terror' 'Death Prof' and 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch'
