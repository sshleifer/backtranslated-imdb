Bombardier, a major player on RKO Radio, is portrayed by Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as coaches at a school of bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott argue over teaching methods while their students argue over Anne Shirley's feelings. O'Brien's methods prove convincing in a raid on Tokyo. Scott and his team are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but Scott, wounded to death, manages to burn a gas truck, offering an ideal target to his fellow bombers. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic films of the war, with moments of poignant subtlety (the death of trainee Eddie Albert) alternating with scenes of ridiculous melodrama "Yellow Peril" (the Japanese literally whistle between their teeth as they tortured defenseless Americans)). Although he can not help but look out of date today, Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort (the film is sometimes mistakenly cited as Robert Ryan's first film, which has appeared in front of the cameras since 1940.) > <br /> If you wish to obtain a copy of this film, please contact me at the following address: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
