It's a very good movie that I enjoyed watching many times. Michael Caine is great as always. Michael Caine has the reputation of playing a role in any movie, no matter how good or not, but he plays well in the role of Sidney. From the beginning, it's so well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, author of texts as scary as The Boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write something so spiritual. Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with a cast of this movie directed by Sidney Lumet? <br /> <br /> I'm really reluctant to go because if someone had to give something about this movie, it would be a crime. Just look and worship.
