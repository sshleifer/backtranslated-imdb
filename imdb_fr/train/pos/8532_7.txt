Lupine leaves for Morocco in search of a legendary treasure. His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It's a different place for Lupine, with the desert and that hot exotic feel. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this film is that Jigen plays a much smaller role than usual, being generally in a different place than Lupine. . On the one hand, their classic dynamic is missed, but it's a change of pace. In addition, Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko is one of those rules. Throughout this feature film, she seduces Lupine and us, viewers. Then there is Lara, the lady of this particular tale, and she is very friendly. This one has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is a fun distinction to have. <br /> <br /> There is a very fun, effeminate ninja who is the best villain of this adventure and who, of course, is fighting very hard with Goemon. , as well as fun scenes with Fujiko. Of course, Inspector Zenigata is also on the warpath. </ P> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> The plot is average and there are some points slow, but overall, this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
