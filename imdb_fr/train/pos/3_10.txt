"The whole world is a stage and its actors are actors" - or something like that. Who said that the theater had stopped at the orchestra pit - or even at the theater door? Why does not the audience participating in the theatrical experience understand the story itself? <br /> <br /> This film was a great experience that said: "Hey, history is you and she needs more than your attention, she has your active participation". "Sometimes we bring you the story, sometimes you have to go to the story." <br /> <br /> Alas, no one listened, but that does not mean it should not have been said.
