It may not have been rewarded by academies and, admittedly, it's pretty old-fashioned, but it's so much fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Friendly, optimistic and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I like Great Adventure, Bogus Journey is funnier for me. Death is hilarious and Bill and Ted are even more endearing. People grieve me to love this movie, but only pretentious moviegoers will say that it's not even a little fun. If you like that, you'll probably be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, although stupid, they make you smile and reverse your tickling. So watch them to laugh and laugh !!
