In the process of building public empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), filmmakers slander the North and the Jayhawkers. Missouri never retired from the Union and its army was not an invading force. Southerners fought for the rights of the state: the right to own slaves, to elect legislatures and twisted judges, and to use a system of political spoils. There is nothing noble in this. The Missouri could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers, it is not because he saw the mistake, but he certainly did not let himself go to the virtue of the cause of abolition.
