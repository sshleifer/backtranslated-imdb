"My Left Foot" is a pretty awesome film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist with cerebral palsy who has learned to paint with her left foot, the only member of her body he can control. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor for this film, which I am not absolutely sure was deserved, but still deserves to be highlighted. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and sometimes almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as a devoted mother of Brown, also won an Oscar for a credible and touching role. My problem with this film is that it is sometimes a bit too real. When Brown is in desperation and needs to help someone and do everything with his left foot, the movie can be hard to watch. This gives it an often depressing impression that can disable some viewers for a while. However, if you look beyond, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have a disability or other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and who still feel that we have problems are inspired by this film, because if their condition is much worse than it allows them to overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. Well done, sometimes nice, but hard to watch. Maybe not for everyone, but not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
