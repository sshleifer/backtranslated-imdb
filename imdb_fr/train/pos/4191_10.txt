This Sam Fuller movie from 1953 contains some of his best works. It is unfortunate that he can not continue to get the support of big Hollywood studios to do his job. The scenario goes something like this. A hard tough off (read a prostitute) takes the subway on a hot summer day and his wallet is chosen by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and the lady) do not realize is that she also carries microfilms that will be passed on to the spies. This first shot without dialogue, and especially near close-ups, is a marvel, one of the many that Fuller uses throughout the film. Jean Peters plays in the little girl known as Candy, who has never been better or more beautiful. We forget how beautiful she was and she manages this role very well. The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who had already made his mark and who had defined his style with Kiss Of Death, of 1947, as a madness with a terrifying laugh. Although it is a little "softer", it remains scary. These hard-featured characters have weak points here and there, but they are black and mean all the way through. The exceptional performance goes to the wonderful Thelma Ritter, who plays the role of Moe, the stoolie, saving her dough to pay for her own funeral. Ritter received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as B girl (read a prostitute) in "From Here To Eternity". Hollywood loves good girls and loves them, even if their performance is generally horrible. See, for example, Shirley Jones in "Elmer Gantry." Placed among the docks and dives of New York, with crisp black and white photographs of the great Joe MacDonald and a very good artistic direction. is particularly good.In the middle of the cold war and red fear, the villian of the play is an ordinary character, played by Richard Kiley, who is far more dangerous than the pickpocket who is a criminal but is just trying to make a living and is above all a faithful American.
