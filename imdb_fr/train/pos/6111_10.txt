I stumbled upon "My Tutor Friend" a year or two ago, accidentally, while I was surfing on TV. Before that, I had never watched Korean movies in my life. MTF was the first Korean movie I have ever seen. And what a beautiful surprise! I had fun from start to finish and had fun laughing. His comic style is quite different from the hilarious movies in Hong Kong (which I'm used to so I'm fed up with it), bringing a breath of fresh air to my monotonous movie viewing experience. I thought that in MTF there were some pretty hilarious, witty and original scenes and tips. <br /> <br /> I watched MTF for the second time a few days ago and I have watched it once, the surprise / comedy effect on me a little attenuated. This did not affect my opinion of the film. Instead, something else has gone through this time - it moved me - the story of how two seemingly incompatible young enemies are joining, and how they have gradually resolved their differences and started to worry about the from each other without realizing their feelings. themselves, reminds me of the long-lost high school. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon ARE really compatible, because they both have something pure and authentic, a quality that separates them from people like, for example, the impertinent girlfriend of Ji Hoon. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two distinct parts - the first part deals with the "fight" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more violent and faster. After Ji Hoon passes the final exam and Su Wan dances the provocative dance (in the opinion of Ji Hoon), things start to change. The pace slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that he cares about Su Wan more than he could have imagined. The second part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final confrontation with the gang leader. <br /> <br /> Just one last comment. I find that a bit incredible. The fact that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed "villain" feels embarrassed about being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his "cool" is just a little .. odd. I guess it shows that Ji Hoon is just a pure-hearted boy and that he is not really what his appearance seems to be. By the way, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) has a sexy body and a perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of 10 favorite movies of all time.
