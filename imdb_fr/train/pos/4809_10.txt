With all the recent films dealing with the British monarchy, is it really time to change? Answer: YOU BET! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the British film wave that deals with the royal family. In this case, it is the beginning of the life of Princess Victoria, the events that led to the coronation of her accession to the rank of Queen of all England, as well as her marriage and her marriage with the Prince Albert. The film also deals with the tumultuous lives and careers of the Queen and the Prince of England, as well as several other events that are unfolding (political unrest, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is complemented by personalities such as Kent's Dutchman Miranda Richardson and the always-on-screen Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as a cast of those who shine in the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), realizes from a winning scenario by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely came out of my head from the visual gaze of the film (from the director of photography Hagen Bogdansker), who gave each image of the film a painter's glance (with the help of the designer of the production, Patrice Vermette), as well as tight montages (of Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner). What I also liked in Fellowes' script is the use of a chess game, as a metaphor for some political motivations of the film (the characters in the movie move like pieces of a game chess). It's an intelligent, well-written, directed, filmed, edited and played entertainment (and enlightenment) that makes for a great movie night. Filed PG by the MPAA for some sensual scenes, some brief violence (a bit bloody, but nothing too bloody), foul language, and some smoking on the screen
