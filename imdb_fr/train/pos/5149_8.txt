It's a lukewarm docu-drama that does not cover any new terrain, reshapes all clich√©s and is sloppy. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is it hilly in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender, but an armistice. Yet this is advertised as a surrender. For example, European news vendors do not (and do not) make headlines by falsifying their newspapers. Yet this strictly American custom is used in the film. For example, the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after they came to power, but it was on the lectern that Hitler delivered one of his reels. Indeed, most of this disappointing production is little more than the Hitlerite oratory. The film also perpetuates the myth that the brewery's coup was hatched at the Hoffbrauhaus in Munich. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes a beautiful portrait of his subject. But its actors are sufficient at best and very often not even. These comments are based on the first episode only. We can only hope that the second will be better but do not bet on it.
