Given the low budget and production limits, this film is very good. Plausible, realistic, it shows how the Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived in the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save an American pilot shot down ruthless and savage Nazis.) A very brave boy - who admires the American pilot. look for special effects, superman heroes and magical ends, this movie does not suit you.If you want to feel what it must have been to dodge the Persistent and Amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion, then this movie you will love and really appreciate it, as well as those who love horses, dogs and the humble and helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to achieve this goal, you will remember it for a long time.
