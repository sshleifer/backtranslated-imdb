The film belongs to the genre Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little history to the story with several standard elements. Well filmed, well edited, with many well played secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Some have said that this movie was an American classic. That's it and more. I agree with those who say "The film celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> The film is a nice reminder that success can come from ordinary roots. <br /> <br />
