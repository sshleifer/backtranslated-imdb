I saw this movie again as a mission for my management class. Mainly commented on different management styles and ideas about the quality (of the product). I rented this one in the eighties and I remember it was a good movie (but not great). I always liked the style and performance of Michael Keaton. He was perfect for the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some of the bad ratings of this movie. I concede that yes, it's not an Oscar but it has a decent comic value. It's more a subtle comedy than a comic farce. I also find some of those who felt it was an inaccurate film about cultural and commercial differences. I do not agree. I grant you again that there is a lot of generality and dramatization but it's still a Hollywood film and not a documentary. From what I read about the differences between car manufacturers on both sides of the Pacific at the time, many of the main ideas were true at the time. <br /> <br /> Some of the fundamental differences were that Japanese workers felt in the context of society as a whole. Teamwork was emphasized. They may have done the company first and foremost. Where American workers had more of a management-work relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I am sure I will probably receive a hateful e-mail about this comment. <br /> <br /> Another difference was the way quality was perceived and the responsibility to fix it. In many Japanese factories, defects or problems are examined and corrected at the time of discovery. As one character in the film says, "it was the dealer problem". <br /> <br /> Many of these things probably date, but I'm sure some are still in the United States. policymakers are still struggling to keep pace with the Japanese. If one is more interested in American, European and Japanese builders, I can recommend a book that examines this subject in more detail and was produced at about the same time. The book is called "The Machine That Changed the World" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. This is a study of car manufacturers during and before the period covered by this film. The parts are a little dry but I think you will find that it also saves the film a lot.
