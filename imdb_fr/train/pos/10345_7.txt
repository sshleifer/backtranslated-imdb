The only other criticism of this film so far really blocks the stars and the film itself. I usually like reading user reviews to get an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I do not know much about. It is unfortunate that there are not many comments on a certain mosaic, because if there is only one criticism and the film and the casting are unreasonably suppressed, you do not know what you are saying. expect. I read the review before watching this title and I do not know where all the venom from this film and stars come from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even when the equipment was not the best. I found the film and performances fun and enjoyable. It's not one of the classics of all time, but a fun and entertaining diversion - more than you can expect in most new movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
