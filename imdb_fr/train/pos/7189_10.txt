My favorite character in the movies, but in almost all the characters, the character of Zorro has a small piece of cloth as a mask and if the villain can not say who is under this fabric, he is silly. <br /> <br /> But in Reed Hadley's "Zorro`s Fighting Legion" (1939 series), the mask covers his entire face, making it a real mystery about Zorro's real identity. <br /> <br /> But anyway, Zorro is one of the best characters in the movies and to update it, I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a delight. <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is huge, but I really like the 30s / 40s series .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
