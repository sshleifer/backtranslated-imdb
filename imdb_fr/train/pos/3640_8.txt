This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is moved and convincing in the role of a man who gave up his dream of becoming a baseball pitcher when his arm abandoned him. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them that he will try to be part of a baseball team if they do. They win (partly because of all the stick training they practice with a coach who can run more than 90 miles an hour), and he holds his share of the bargain - and is signed! <br /> <br /> If you've already decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult, Jim Morris's story will resonate with you. It's moving and inspiring, and the relationships of the man sound true. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I praise this one. Dennis Quaid is just pure in the room and a baseball movie with a handsome man changing a diaper is my idea of ​​paradise. Ladies, if you feel like me, take a look at this one.
