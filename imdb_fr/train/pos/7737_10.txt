If you're a big fan of an author like me, Jim Thompson, it can be quite risky to see their works converted into movies. This is not the case with Scott Foley's interpretation of AFTER DARK MY SWEET. A black classic loaded with sensuality and loaded with sexuality, which follows closely and does justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward probably give the best performances of their career. And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern could even surpass himself with this one. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world where passion prevails over logic and where the double cross is never far away. A must for all fans of super movie noir. **** !!!
