How not to rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this film is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history! This is the first "real" movie in the history of cinema ("The Prince of Wales" was the first, but it was not technically advanced enough?) And it undoubtedly has a huge value international. Those people that you can see ending their work day in the film were lucky to participate in a historic moment, becoming the first people to be able to see themselves move! And especially the shot is a nice shot! And it's very touching when you think of the first people to have seen that! What moment! History for science first (because the Lumi√®re brothers first invented the cinematograph for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie to worship!
