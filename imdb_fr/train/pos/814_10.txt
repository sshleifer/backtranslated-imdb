Thanks to Kevin Smith, many geeks run by claiming that the Return of the Jedi is not good, because it's really fun to watch. And oh no! Muppets are involved! It hurts! Everyone loved Return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it. Now, all of a sudden, people are looking at you as if you have an illness if you say how much you love them. This film is so much better than anything Kevin Smith ever considered creating that I think the man would even think of denouncing it. This movie is very fun! It's as great as I remember when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing Kevin Smith's opinions! Its not correct! <br /> <br /> And this song of Ewok at the end reigned! I bet you do not even like "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I will fire you all!
