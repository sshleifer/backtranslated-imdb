Fabulous, fantastic, probably the best musical adventure of Disney. I have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, intelligent and fun. Despite the silly scenes of "flying bed", the other scenes and dialogues are magical and fun. Could they have chosen someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I do not see anyone more apt to play this role. To redo this classic would be as stupid as to redo Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, although he has few quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. He was a comic book genius who is often forgotten nowadays. English bluffing, primitive and correct - no one could really slapstick and get away with it as gracefully as him. It would be tragic to redo this film because Tomlinson died a few years ago and no one could put himself in his place and do justice to his character. <br /> <br /> Night dresses and dancing armor give off a magical aura that other witch movies simply do not capture. I particularly appreciate the places where the Germans invade the house of Eglantine and she must defend it as she can. <br /> <br /> Racing, floating at the bottom of the beautiful brackish sea. Richard and Robert Sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers. All are fantastic and worth remembering, Portobello Road being one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A great movie that still holds today !!
