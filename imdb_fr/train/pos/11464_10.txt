What is most troubling in this film is not that scenes of murder at school like the one described here actually occur, but the truth is that it's teenagers like Cal and Andr√© who lead to success. Using a Blair Witch portable camera technique, Ben Coccio has managed to get us into the lives of two friends who have problems with high school, although we never know exactly what is behind these issues. They seem to be typical - many people hate high school, so what? Part of you just do not believe that they will ever lead the well-thought Zero Day massacre. The scenes of surveillance cameras in the school during filming are all the more powerful. You can not believe that this is really happening and that it really happened. The technique of the portable camera also creates the illusion that it is not a scripted film, a brilliant idea given the subject treated.
