Overall, this movie is not perfect. It does not go very well together, because the scenario is essentially composed of hooks to hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a bit "too 80" and have a tendency to date the chart. </ p> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know that a movie has something special when you and your friends always refer to silly quotes over two decades later. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a lot of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., skipper of Gilligan's Island. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are great absurd moments, such as when Johnny labels puppies with a gun, or the pope who makes an appearance in Johnny's neighborhood. In addition, the scene where the false priest composes many words in Latin is excellent. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio is too strong ... Post the meridian, the previous meridian, the meridian uncle"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney crushing the English language Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne on "Play Ball" Peter Boyle thinking he lost his manhood The fake film of VD <br /> <br /> > This film is not a success. But like "Porky's", he has enough classic comedy pieces to make it memorable.
