This film presents the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane are the main characters. <br /> <br /> As the civil war comes to an end, Lincoln expresses his fear that the country's dynamism will be strengthened if people follow the following advice: "Go West, young man", that, fortunately, the film did not mistakenly attribute to Horace Greeley, like many others. But then he is murdered and some financiers speculate that they can get rich by selling weapons to Native Americans. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a little boy, steamboat is loading at a wharf along the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he finally gives the boy, calling him an "Arkansas toothpick", which was actually a different type of knife, although both were used throughout the border. <br /> <br /> Hickock finally meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks a lot like the photographs and paintings of the man. Cody just got married and takes her fiancee to the West West to settle down. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at their destination, they fall on Calamity Jane, who cracks for Hickock. She looks at Cody's wife and asks Buffalo Bill, "Is this your mopsy?" It was this line that caused a problem at the Hayes Board, since one of the definitions of the word "mopsy" was "prostitute". Demille wanted to enter the game and one of her assistants pointed out that in Beatrix Potter's books about Peter Rabbit, three of the rabbits were Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed it out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of bad virtue". It worked; the line stayed in it. <br /> <br /> The Indians were starting to get agitated, partly because of the high-quality weapons they received from the Eastern Financial Officer. Cody and Hickock were asked to help locate the area so that troops could safely go to a besieged area. Cody led the troops; Hickock went to check on the activities of an Indian chief, who was an old acquaintance and who led some of the hostile Indians. <br /> <br /> Calamity Jane is captured and Hickock is captured as she tries to save her. They are brought before the chief and, although they do not speak to each other, the torture applied to Hickock breaks the will of Calamity Jane. She recounts the road taken by Cody. <br /> <br /> Both are released and Hickock joins Cody. and his forces, partly to alert them, are throwing themselves into a trap. With the help of Hickok, they repel the Indian attack. <br /> <br /> Hickock decides to go after the gunmen and finally takes them prisoner. While waiting for the authorities, Hickock is shot in the back while playing cards. <br /> <br /> The film contains many historical anomalies, but it retains the taste of legend. Pretty good for the 1930s.
