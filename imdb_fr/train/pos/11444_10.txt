Check out this film to see the beautiful images of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures and treat yourself to a relaxing and eye-opening experience. The music perfectly complements the footage, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators have described the interview excerpts with the weak spot artist, but think about this: why would you develop this in a movie, if you could read Andy's thoughts in his books for a long time, or attend the show? one of his excellent lectures? This medium is much more appropriate to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works and is used expertly in this regard.
