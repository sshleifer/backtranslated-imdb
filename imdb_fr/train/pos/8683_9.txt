"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the first crucial episodes of "Columbo" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. This is the first of four appearances by Robert Culp (three as a murderer), playing about the same role in each show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp plays the role of Brimmer, the head of a large private detective firm asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper mogul, Mr. Kennicut, had an affair. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut, in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in exchange for bits of information about her husband's partners. She reacts badly to this suggestion, an argument ensues that quickly turns into violence when Brimmer hits her in the face. As he wears a large ring, the blow hits her on the ground and kills her. <br /> <br /> The episode contains truly priceless moments. One of my favorite scenes is where Columbo claims to be playing in the palm of his hand, although it's actually a trick to discover the shape and size of the Brimmer ring without admitting that he knows that the murderer was wearing a ring. Columbo being Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when it's time to turn the screws a bit. So, at first, he plays clumsily the role of a rather simple-minded man who is excited by the "lifeline crossing the mound of the moon", or an equally ridiculous mumbo-jumbo who reads flippers . <br /> <br /> Another Brimmer is trying to propose to Columbo a job for his company, corrupting him so that he stops interfering in the nose. Again, Columbo does not reveal that he knows what is happening, he claims to be honored and excited about this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there's another place where Columbo tells Kennicut, in front of Brimmer, that he wants the murderer to hear their conversation. He wants to suggest to Brimmer that he is on him, without directly accusing him, so he decides rather cruelly (but it is understandable in the circumstances) to play games of thought on Brimmer to scare him and make him stupid. What he does of course! Meanwhile, Kennicut in mourning ignores the content of this conversation. It is only towards the end that Columbo explains everything to Kennicut (not displayed on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not reveal how Columbo finally managed to silence the killer, but let's say there is a potato involved. .. <br /> <br /> A very good episode, probably the best of the first series. If you liked that, you will also like "Double Exposure", also with Robert Culp.
