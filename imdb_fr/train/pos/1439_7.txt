CITY HALL is a bag a little mixed. Part vignettes of the political life of New York and moralizing part. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-esque Boss with presidential dreams, gives a performance often morose or moderate. A few times, he chews the landscape and, in the case of CITY HALL, it is where he shines. John Cusack gives a discreet and generally flawless performance, without going into the caricature of a dialect of New Orleans, nor in the melodrama during the climax of the film. Danny Aiello, as local political leader, is also very good. I also like TV shows. <br /> <br /> The main problem of CITY HALL, and it's a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of a lack of dynamism. It's more like a documentary than a movie. We see the action or follow the story from a detached point of view and, of course, the viewer does not get involved. When the viewer does not get involved to a certain extent, he becomes apathetic to the characters and eventually to the plot. <br /> <br /> This tends to alienate, and what should have been a captivating finale, revealing the details, came as a "Hmmm ... um ... ok." They say that you can not fight City Hall, as the clich√© says. Still, that still can not stop you thinking about what might have been, if they had just tightened the screenplay and rhythms of this movie.
