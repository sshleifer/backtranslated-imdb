It was really a good idea, the scenario was just ok.It could have been better, the good thing is that it does not bother you if you are an adventure lover, a new idea of ​​the lost world of Atlantis. The relatives are that I personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than that. They should have ended up with a better adventure than this one. It was not bad at all, but it would have been a lot better with a little more running time. Let's say it was boring or not good ... A good movie for those who like animations like Sindbad, like The Road of El Dorado. This film is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with an end.
