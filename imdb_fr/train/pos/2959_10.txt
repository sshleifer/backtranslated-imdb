It was a Saturday night and a movie called BASEketball was on television. I had always wanted to watch it, but I had never done it when it was in the cinema. Boy was I was wrong. The words can not describe how funny this movie is, featuring the creators of South Park, who share a natural chemistry on screen while being funny. I recorded the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time, I saw it 7 times !! I'm obsessed with this, and I know that anyone who appreciates the work of Trey and Matts will appreciate this film. TO SEE ABSOLUTELY, THIS IS MY COMEDY NO.1 OF ALL TIME
