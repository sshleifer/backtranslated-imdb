Cat Soup at first seems to be a very random animated film. The best way I could explain it is that it's pretty acidic. Although it is not totally random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat boy and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very ill and dies, however, Nyatta sees her soul being swept away by death and is able to recover half of it. The story tells of their quest to bring Nyaako back to life. <br /> <br /> Even if the content of this film seems totally random, it is not. It is essentially symbolism for life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other tales, such as Hansel and Gretal. This strangely cute short has an interesting story, full of meaning deeper than the one you see on the screen.
