I rented this movie on blockbuster on a whim .. I love alan arkin and the cover was hung ... I read the back and I knew right away that it was going to be the best or the worst movie I've never seen ... I guess I was lucky .. I laughed from beginning to end .. Alan Arkin brings a very good character to this movie. Since then, I bought a rental copy used for my own collection and I watch it all the time. I recommended this film to a lot of people and they all appreciated it as much as me ... I see complaints about the menus and the DVD. functions .. but that does not detract from the movie .. the record was written for Blockbuster exculsivley and that's why they did not allow you to skip the previews in advance ... other than that, you should not let the functions of the DVD to prevent you from watching the excellent movie.
