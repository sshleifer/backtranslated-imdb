I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For example, the film is based on the book and if the author had a gay character, then how could "Hollywood" simply add a symbolic gay character to the movie. And then there were two gay characters and I thought they reflected well. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not exaggerated. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other critic had the decency to watch the entire movie, she could have seen that her character had developed throughout the film interacting with other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to see the car that Sara had crushed in the case, we could see her mother's side coming out and later in the movie, you saw that she too was invincible. But I guess if you're too worried about gay characters and bad characters, then this movie is bad. But if you're more open-minded and I do not really know if you have an idea of ​​what's good, then you'll enjoy this movie.
