Four girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for the spring break. Unfortunately, they have a flat tire in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder in the woods. The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins ... "Shallow Grave" is a pleasant surprise for the budget minded. The cast is quite friendly, the direction is stable and the violence particularly nasty and misogynous. The second murder is particularly dark. The murderous sheriff is not a one-dimensional character. He seems to feel remorse for what he did. The secondary plot involving the two boys they meet at dinner is not going anywhere, but stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 out of 10.
