<br /> <br /> Unlike the comments I just read about nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would like to see it as a weekly series. <Br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills, but also a huge fan of Chuck Norris. Although I recognize that some action scenes may have lengthened the line a little, the scenario fits perfectly with the other weekly series. are being broadcast. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes, while Deke was fleeing the bad guys after detonating their missiles, were very hectic. I really do not see how many "professionals" were not able to hit a moving target, but the action was there and Deke, as a hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> Regarding the comment on the need to "put the film in the box to fill the time slot after the playoffs". CBS had not originally planned this movie for January. The shooting ended in May 2001, four months before the terrorist attacks against the United States. <br /> <br /> If the author of the comment had focused his attention on the film instead of trying to avoid it, perhaps they would have understood the plot of the story: Rashid, a character who looks like bin Laden, had planned to trigger a nuclear device in the United States. The president's man was called to locate and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer should actually MONITOR the movie before attempting to comment on it. <br /> <br />
