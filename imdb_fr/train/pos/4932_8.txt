In Panic In The Streets, Richard Widmark plays the role of a US Navy doctor, whose week was brutally interrupted by a cadaver containing the plague. As cop Paul Douglas points out, the guy died from two bullets in his chest. This is not the problem here, they become reluctant partners in their efforts to find the killers and all those who are exposed to the disease. <br /> <br /> As pointed out a number of people, for some reason, the director Elia Kazan did not bother to present the small rooms with anyone who looks like the Louisiana. Having visited New Orleans where the story unfolds, I can personally testify to it. Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes may be excused as he could be assigned as a Navy doctor, but that does not work for the natives. <br /> <br /> But with the plague and the news being kept secret, the PD of New Orleans begins the tragedy of the underworld of the city. The dead man came out of a ship from Europe and had relations with the underworld. A wise man from New Orleans played by Jack Palance raises all sorts of erroneous conclusions and begins to harass a cousin of the deceased who begins to show symptoms of plague. Palance received rave reviews in the first film where he was informed. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. It happened just before Mostel was blacklisted and at that point he made a specialty: playing would be tough guys. He plays the same kind of role in Humphrey Bogart's The Enforcer. Unfortunately, I can somehow identify with Mostel in this last hunting scene where he and Palance are hunted down by Widmark, Douglas and half of the New Orleans police. Seeing the weight challenged by Zero to try to track Palance was something else because I'm part of the Zero League in the heavyweight department. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the action to a good clip, there is very little downtime in this movie. If there were less, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. Panic In The Streets wins the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year. <br /> <br /> Kazan also operates the waterfront of New Orleans and the French Quarter. Some of the same types of shots are used later in On the Waterfront. In fact, in Panic In The Streets, people do not cry when they really should for their own sake. Very similar to On the seafront. <br /> <br /> Panic In The Streets is the pride of all those who have been associated with it. Now, why could not Elia Kazan get decent people in New Orleans in small roles?
