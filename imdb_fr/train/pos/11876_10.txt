You know, when we watch this Brian DePalma movie today, I'm sure there's been a lot of criticism about his dating. Also, about the violence. When I watched this movie on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was ultra violent and gritty. But I did not understand. <br /> <br /> After a few decades, man, I know how much I did not have this movie !! It's a remake of an excellent film made in the 30s / 40s. How can you improve a classic? You do not do it. But you tell a story that has been updated through the eyes of "new immigrants" during the most greedy decade, the 80 years too indulgent. DePalma, Stone and the gang present a good ambitious film, disturbing and dignified. <br /> <br /> Yes ... The disco was dying and New Wave / Punk was taking over, but those immigrants from Cuba who were to make a new home in Florida could not tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted but how to get it ???? For these immigrants, there was only one way to get it to Florida, where they were .. by having a lot of money and to get it, you had to take over the management of a drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was fantastic for me like Tony Montana, the "little train that could". What an amazing way to make your main character look at America: fight, kill, steal. lie, deceive everything to get - "money, women and power." <br /> <br /> That's what Tony saw as the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted it, he wanted it to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with the way he went to get it. Tony Montana's mastery of the English language was heavily saturated with the word "f", but what did you expect Emily Post to finish studying for him and his cohorts? Look how they came to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. This is how Tony and his team chose "to be all they can be in America". Everything was a question of power. Tony Montana would have done and done everything to reach him ... with all his violent, lying, stolen, crooked and thieving glory. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that personified the 1980s is money laundering. Tony's crew bringing money bags of drugs to the bank. Do those around Tony and his crew care in the clubs where he spent and drank? Nope. Money was money and with money, you get the power. Tony lived high pork. Michelle Pfieffer and her beautiful blond American trophy with which he married played well. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana's rise to power, he discovers that it's really bad. He is riddled with doubt, he is an addict, he is paranoid, he is surrounded by those who want to take him in a bloody takeover, his trophy, a blonde American woman addict to the 80s he discovers as a nuisance, he needs to stay at the top of his empire because ... he is falling. And down there, it goes in a violent and atrocious way, but again, I ask, what are you waiting for? <br /> <br /> This is the film par excellence of the 1980s that tells you the distorted story of how some misunderstand the American dream ... obsession. It's violent, bloody, excessively, but it brings the problem home. All Cubans expelled from Cuba who landed in Florida in the 1980s looked nothing like Tony Montana. Leave me alone. But the demonstration of the misery of the 1980s with its focus on greed and money is the only measure taken in the United States to "be someone" and for the power to stand out from the game of these poor characters and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> Make you wonder - has it already been learned - today?
