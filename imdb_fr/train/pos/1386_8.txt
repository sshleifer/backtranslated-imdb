Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle is barely there. At the top, Marie, a serious tomboy, small and thin, with a Belmondo type facial structure. Her best friend is the opposite physical and psychological: flirtatious, chubby - I dare say big - and eager for his first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for his first sexual encounter. Because of its heaviness, the boys do not seem interested and it hurts. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the apex is a beautiful blonde vamp "fatal girl". She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming at the competitive level. Marie sees her at a competition at the local public pool. Marie insinuates herself into the life of the vampire using as argument the desire to become a synchronized swimmer. The vamp has the reputation of being a whore, chatting with a young man in orbit around her. Mary is not eliminated by this reputation. Focus on reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is organized. We see a lot of synchronized swimming as we get to know the three girls. Finally, the story leaves the swimming synchronized behind and focuses on upside-down relationships between the three. It is then that unexpected things begin to happen. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. This one is no exception. Here it is about the ceiling and the dying. See the movie to learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says that the use of synchronized swimming is useful. This women's sport is a metaphor for a girl's life: pretty and feminine on the surface, hardworking and competitive. A number of scenes explain this point: elegant gestures and smiles for the audience, legs wriggling underwater. The title in French is also suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggests to an individual to juggle many pressures simultaneously.
