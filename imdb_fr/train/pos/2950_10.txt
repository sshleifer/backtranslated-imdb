If you were a sad day not being able to get a DVD movie, you were probably looking for "Delirium". How often do you laugh when you watch standing comedy routines? I was too young to see Richard Pryor at his best, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's Delirious and Raw (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie drew much of his inspiration. Now that I'm older and I've seen Pryor and many comics after Murphy, I realize two things: Eddie's Everybody STEALS, while Eddie is Richard's LOVINGLY BORROWED. That's the huge difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful ?? and more. It was something never seen before. He was everything we needed. These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old ?? but he was once king and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. Really one of the funniest routines of all time.
