I really like this movie. There is a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story quite universal, that of the prodigal son. The aspect that I like most is the way the bathroom was more than a background for the story. While the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the deserts of northern China, the water and bathing element became an almost sacred ritual. The water was so rare that a simple bath had a deep depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was very effective. There were moments, however, when he came close to the "too" sweet ... at the edge of the disgusting during the recital scene of the park. But overall, I highly recommend this movie.
