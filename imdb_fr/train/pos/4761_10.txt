An excellent film with excellent performances by Zack & Lochley. To their great dissatisfaction (and mine), Garibaldi arrived at the station. (All the respect I owe to Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 and 5, I lost sympathy for the character.) He was quick to start criticizing Zack (whom I love the most in the series ) and to take things in hand. I'm sure Zack could have managed. The Soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack does. Humor completes it well. 10/10
