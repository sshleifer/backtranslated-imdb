The original title means "The birth of octopus". I must confess that I do not understand this title very well. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after writing this, I read another user's comment: "The title in French is also suggestive:" prieuve ", or octopus, suggests to an individual to juggle several pressures simultaneously." Thank you for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear whether they are directed to the same sex or to another sex. It's no different for boys. I think that Floriane and Marie will end up having heterosexual feelings without any mixing. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is composed of aquatic ballet. Sometimes the girls are upside down and nothing above the water, except for their feet and legs, with which they will wave and kick in the air. For people like me who had never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the leader of a team of "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her that she would like to see when Floriane trains. This seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary. Soon, they will walk together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a waiter is waiting for him, then leaves with him for an hour, while Marie waits for her return. I took it for granted that the couple slept with each other. But we will learn later from the movie that they do less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide information that few users will find elsewhere. There is a scene in which Marie secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag. She finds an apple there, most of the time eaten. And Mary proceeds to eat the rest. ?? There is a parallel scene in another film, "Kazetachi no gogo" by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). These are young adult women and a clearly lesbian woman is in vain in love with a heterosexual woman. She also steals a trash bag from the beloved, also finds an apple more or less eaten and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later, Floriane tells Marie that she would like to have her first orgasm. Mary says she can not do that. <br /> <br /> But still later, Mary says she's really willing to do it. And she masturbates on Floriane. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a director could have done such a beautiful psychological show or such a study ?? I would like to quote Baudelaire, "Les amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane is played by Ad√®le Haenel, who has performed well as an autistic girl in Christophe Ruggia's "The Little Devils" (2002)? ? a very underrated movie.
