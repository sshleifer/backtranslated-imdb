Paul Verhoeven (genius and master filmmaker) returns with the less than perfect, but still fun in "a dirty old man type", Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the final act of slasher is disappointing. Still, I recommend this film for its special effects MIND BLOWING (perhaps the best so far) and its two performances in dandy of the main actors. Verhoeven's moral questions are of course provocative, and although the film shocked many, this film is rather tender for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two major flaws: Josh Brolin (aka walking monkey-man) all with the elevator. If there was an access ladder, why were they stuck in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie for a Saturday night.
