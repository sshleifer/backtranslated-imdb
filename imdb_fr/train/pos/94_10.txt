I am a big fan of John Denver. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this special Christmas TV show and loved it. I have the vinyl album and the original CD. I have the original CD and the later version. However, several songs are missing in the latest version. I see he has come out this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for $ 75.00. WOW - thinking that a Christmas CD would have such value. For me, no amount is worth the sale of this treasure. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I could never find it on VHS or DVD. I would like to have one or the other version. If anyone has one available, let me know. Thank you
