With lots of sunshine, shady light and filtering shadow through windows and rooms, allowing you to follow snapshots moving through the crowd with a portable camera, quick fixtures and extreme close-ups here and there, photography is what is more interesting in this art makes the film. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film begins as a little down on a beauty contest. The movie begins with a hot Sunday at the local pool, where we meet the lovely Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks). A bit like a joke in front of the amazed men at the edge of the pool, she soon decides to go home herself. to represent France in the beauty contest of Miss Europe, much to the chagrin of her fianc√© very jealous and persevering (a rather boring type, really). The ten competitors appear in swimsuits while the winner is chosen to be the competitor who receives the longest applause (I wondered if the girls could not walk more slowly to extend their time - and so the applause - then ) the podium?!). Lulu is soon pursued by a prince and a maharaja, but his handsome boy with a pensive head does not like the attention he receives from other men or his public adoration, by the way (I suppose he wants it just at home, cooking). his meals, and stay out of sight, huh ?!). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence contributes to showcasing this film, but it's really the way in which he is photographed that has attracted the most interest. The strange doubled sound is somewhat embarrassing. The impression on this version was very clear and contrasted. Looking at this, I just tried to ignore the sound issues and watch the movie visually, and found the movie to be excellent and worth watching.
