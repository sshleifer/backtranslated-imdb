I have seen this film three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> The acting is incredible, which is not hard to believe since it is Daniel Day Lewis, who is an incredible actor. Brenda Fricker is the surprise wonder there. She captures your heart as the mother of a physically handicapped boy, who can not walk or talk until he reaches the end of his adolescence. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough good things about the movie, but I will stop here. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies based on real events or just enjoy good dramas in general.
