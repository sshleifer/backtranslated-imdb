No one could ruin this job! An impressive movie! Written brilliantly by Ira Levin and portrays the best performance of Christopher Reeve's career and one of Caine's best, it's just excellent. I wish I could see a staged version somewhere ... maybe someday I'll do it. I hope this grossly underrated and neglected film has not become too difficult to locate because it is a "must" for any Hitchcockian, Agatha-phile or any great movie lover. "Deathtrap" is one of the few films that I could neither fix nor predict instantly and that was worth a second or even a third, is a 9/10 and wins every quarter of an hour. We need and deserve more movies like this one!
