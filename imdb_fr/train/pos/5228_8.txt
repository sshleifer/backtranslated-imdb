I found this film hilarious. The parodies on the other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest I've seen in this kind of movie. Tries. If you have seen the movie as this movie is a parody, and you have humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Me (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part of the movie. (It's not a spoiler because I will not tell you what's really going on) was a scene with MIB's "flashy thing". When they discover the camera for the first time and will not know what it's doing, then again later in the movie, you'll understand when you get there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is that I could never find it on DVD to buy a copy.
