Screenwriter-director Brian De Palma is best known for his film series, which is unfairly called "Hitchcock imitations". Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not tear Hitchcock; he borrows elements of history or character that could have been seen in a Hitchcock film, then develops them in a more violent and modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for his mixture of bloody death and macabre humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill", created in 1980, is perhaps Hitchcockian's best-known film, De Palma, and it's probably his best too. The story features a serial killer stalking both a burnt housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street whore (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it will remind you distinctly. of "Psycho", but De Palma's film is as technically ingenious as it is dark. The sequence of the museum is particularly well noted and edited; The scene of the handles in the elevators is also one of the most exceptional murders ever filmed. "Dressed to Kill" may not be an original, but I would say it's well worth it. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10
