Very good image of a man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the murderer wanted to hit the lady, why not leave her alone and let the cops try to find the thriller? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths that must be feared to remain closed. Why did the depressed lady go to the bar when she could barely sit on a chair or say a word? Are there really any discerning cops, chewing gums, smiling apes who approach a suspect so casually? It probably played well before the wheel was invented, but it's so cheesy and unbelievable today. Catch the manic drum break by Elisha Cook; his frenzied pounding never matched the recording. His crazy facial expressions made up for the off-beat synchronization.
