Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel that showed it at the beginning. First, Pachelbel's Cannon hit my throat, then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I stole) produced a slight moisture around the eyes and then the name Crowe hooked me completely. This film, Crowe's performance (again), the subject (and yes, what debt we owe to us), the way different issues were addressed and dealt with, the flight sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons) , history - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I will not spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife at about 4,000 miles, as a former army officer deployed in a few wars and as a private pilot, I confess to having cried twice . Buy it, rent it, download it, beseech it, borrow it or steal it, but watch it. <br /> <br /> PS Did I see a Bristol Blenheim (with yellow training colors) on the ground? Looks like a twin-engine aircraft with a double-.303 Browning in a dorsal turret.
