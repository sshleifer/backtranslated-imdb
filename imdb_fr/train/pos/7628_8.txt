This movie is one of those "WOW!" movies. Not because it's the greatest movie of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a T.V. movie, but it was also on Elvis. I can say that there is only one Elvis among the imitators, but I can also say that Kurt Russel was very close to reality. It was one of the greatest imitations I have ever seen. He made me believe that it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis' life watching this movie. And do not direct the TV part, do not be misled - it's actually a really fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis's twin :)
