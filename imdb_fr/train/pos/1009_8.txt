Reality: Stargate SG-1 is a TV science fiction series galore. <br /> <br /> There are no obvious facts. How often do you try to apologize or explain it? Stargate SG-1 remains a TV science fiction series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas quickly. The special effects are not as impressive as they could have been and the action is not going to upset you. Or a sofa for this business either. <br /> <br /> But, and that's where I really think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for every episode or stolen idea I think you can count on. at least one sci-fi movie that's worse than a one-hour TV episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes would have probably lasted 90 minutes and would have been better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And being able to maintain that quality throughout the show, continue to broadcast and advance the storyline is what makes Stargate SG-1 special. <br /> <br /> I am very difficult with my selections. I'm probably at most one or two TV series and I have high standards, which made me even more surprised when I found myself caught. <br /> <br /> So, for those who decide to brush Stargate SG-1 until now another insolent science fiction show, no. Stick to it and you will see what I am talking about.
