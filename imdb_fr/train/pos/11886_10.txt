I loved this film. First of all because it's a family film. Second, because it offers a refreshing view of HIV information in a family, with far less hysteria than I've seen in movies. The brothers are very close but do not pass judgment. Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but not necessary in the end. I understand that Leo's choice of how to treat his treatment may not have been the most popular with people, but I thought it was the right choice for him. I can not believe it was a French TV program. He had excellent production values. I gave a dozen to this film, and I think you'll do it too, once you've seen it.
