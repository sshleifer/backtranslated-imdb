An unconventional historical drama, with some beautiful battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance and gets a pretty good backup. The screenplay is written and quite original, and the film is fortunately kept free of heroes. That said, it's a little slow and the last reel is too much like a TV mini-series. Still, filming Frederick Elmes keeps you interested in boring things (and from time to time you see a plan that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth to be seen.
