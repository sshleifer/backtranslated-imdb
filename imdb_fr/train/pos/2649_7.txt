Walking with Cavemen, animated by Alec Baldwin, is a look at all species of hominids (ie us!) From the past 5 million years: who were they, how were they and how were they they disappeared? In addition to being a very interesting scientific overview of the information we have about these species, Walking with Cavemen also examines what makes us human. I waited several weeks to look at this and I was not disappointed.
