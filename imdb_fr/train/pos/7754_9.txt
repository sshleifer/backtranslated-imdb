Whatever the wind blows, Tom Barmans (who is also known to be the singer of the first film of the rock formation 'dEUS'). Shot entirely in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins with a sunny Friday morning and jumps rather superficially between the events that occupy the day of a dozen main characters. At the end of the film, you have to think a lot, because most scenarios are largely left open. <br /> <br /> The film has a soundtrack (purely instrumental) that will make your socks vibrate. In most scenes, the music really enhances the overall feel and feel and makes the movie amazing at times. The main scene of the film, the party, is very well filmed. <br /> <br /> The director did not hesitate to use the technique of the video clip, his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks heard lately. <br /> <br /> The scenario is excellent. Camera angles and colors are very well chosen. The costumes are very hot and very 'seventy' too. And I loved (most) actors. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most about the film are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that intertwine. <br /> <Without pretending to be a comedy (this film is certainly not a comedy, but an alternative work of art), it still manages to make his audience laugh and even burst out laughing at times. <br /> <br /> It's still a director's beginning that should not be an end. I hope to see more of Tom Barman's films in the future because I had a good time. Cheers.
