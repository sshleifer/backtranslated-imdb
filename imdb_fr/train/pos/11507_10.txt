I remember very well the original series, mainly because of its unique mix of ironic humor and macabre subjects. Kolchak was a staunch reporter for the school of reporters of big cities Ben Hecht. His determination and his wise attitude made even the most mundane episode eminently observable. My favorite was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because of its totally original script. A poor and troubled Cajun boy from the Bayou country, Louisiana, participates in a sleep research experiment to analyze his dreams. Something happens inexplicably and he literally dreams of giving life to a swamp creature who lives in the dark folk tales of his youth. This malicious manifestation seeks out all the people who have wronged the dreamer in his state of consciousness and stifles them brutally. Kolchak investigates and discovers this horrible truth, much to the chagrin of police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderfully tested by grumpy Keenan Wynn) and the chief researcher on sleep played by the founder of Second City, Severn Darden, to perfection, a perfection. The terribly funny and heartbreaking finale takes place in the Chicago sewer system and is one of the highlights of the series. Kolchak never improved. Timeless.
