This remarkable Argentine independent film is one of the best in the year 2000 of South America, including Argentina, which has produced an impressive number of quality films since 1999. In 2000 alone, Argentina released many quality movies that beat the Argentine B. records. Half a dozen people have been internationally acclaimed, like this one, at major world film festivals. After watching this film, we can see how Argentine films of national origin were able to win back 20% of its national film market. <br /> <br /> Directed by one of the best Argentine directors, Daniel Burman, this film examines the globalization effects, but highlights its impact on Argentina, and in particular on the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as a nice Jewish boy, trying to survive and even succeed in the current business climate. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors of Hispanic cinema in the world, is perfect like Simon, the Jewish father, as well as the rest of the cast, which includes Spanish and Italian stars. <br /> <br /> So many current issues in Western urban societies are explored, I do not have enough space to go into details. Daniel Burman intelligently integrates them into the plot with different characters embodying various dilemmas. If this film goes to a festival near you or on video, do not miss it!
