How can you go wrong with the incredible Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while other useless people live forever. I am paraphrasing here, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of underprivileged children fighting against the administration of their oppressive high school. It is extremely ridiculous, but there is refreshing optimism (even if they decide to blow up the building). Who knew it would become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule from a time when it was still believed that music was important and could make a difference to society as a whole. It's full of children who know that authority does not have the right answers. Rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. <br /> <br /> But the most important thing is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Do not take any of this seriously. Just enter and have a good time. If it was not high school life in the 70's, it was fine.
