I saw this jewel of Joe Sarno for the first time when, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. At first, I thought the movie was going a bit slower than I'd expected for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer first came in, the first time I saw her, I was seated and taken note. Her presence in this film is hard to avoid and pimps every scene in which she is involved. I saw most of the other Sarno films, and the other movies starring or starring Jennifer Welles, and I have to say it was both Sarno and Jennifer at their best. The direction of Sarno in this adult domestic drama is superb, and Jennifer has shown (figuratively and literally) an actor prowess that makes it a must-see. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, two frequent co-stars of Ms. Welles and stars of Sarno's work, perform credible performances as adventurous and yet normal housewives. This film is a Sarno classic.
