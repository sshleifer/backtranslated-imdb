Although this is certainly not the best movie I have ever seen, it was certainly worth $ 8 (you can not say as many movies these days.) <br /> <br /> true story, although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie (ie Billy Sunday's character was composed of three or four people combined.) Robert DeNiro was of course good and Cuba Gooding, Jr., was equally impressive.
