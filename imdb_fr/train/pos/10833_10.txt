This movie made me cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw tons of great movies, even more shit. But when I finished the scene - the catharsic in the center - came I cried! And if you have not done it, you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But it's real - because that kind of thing really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music but I really admire everything they experienced in the early 70's ... At one point, it led me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never work really well. But this movie really made us think of everything ... Because they do not try to do it like a road full of glorious concerts, superhero musicians, stupid and emotionally numb groupies, they do not glorify drugs . and alcohol, they promote the rehabilitation and redemption that happens even with 20 years late ... Again a very good movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas", I've never been so moved by a movie.
