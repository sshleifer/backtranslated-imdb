Everyone has bills to pay, including Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that the war is over and return home if they see a group of prisoners of war, including Christopher Walken. After a fight of Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome and a short massacre later. Walken and a Colombian shared a dollar bill by promising something else. <br /> <br /> In the present (1991), the Colombian is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He succeeds at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush people with a tank, he is forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown with many bloody details in the form of news on American TV, which led Walken to gather the old team (although he was not part of this team initially), to invade Colombia and to attack thousands of people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a film of monumental stupidity, but it's still a good laugh and packed action too. This is one of those movies where logic has a place of choice: how could Walken fire a fighter pilot in the head from another aircraft without decompression or even breaking a window? In addition, it seems that these guys can shoot dozens of drug traffickers in New York without the police worrying about the police. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of b-movie madness here, from Michael Ironside's devilish behavior in Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but utterly useless death of one of the heroes, to the confrontation frank between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the passionate speech of the rebel leader's sister, watched on television in America (almost a brown tear to my eye from below, this piece). <br /> <br /> He's here for a book. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how often you can spot the film crew.
