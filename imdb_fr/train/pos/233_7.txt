I actually found this film 'interesting'; finally, a value of my time watching and renting. That's right ... some scenes were emotional, screaming, etc. Almost none! What surprises me is that I read a criticism elsewhere made by a critic of S.Fran on another site of criticism, but that his negative criticism rather provided to him a more precise description of his "own" criticism of the film; not at all from the film. Anyone watching this movie will realize that it is good to recommend it to their family and friends. no car hunting, yes !! Being myself in an Italian family, I can fully understand the environment described on the screen. The film also has heartbreaking parts. This is what real life can be in such an environment. Good movie.
