How can the viewer of this film get a rating of only 5.4 ?! The pretty young Alisan Porter should automatically start at 6 am when you decide on your note. James Belushi is also good at this role, his first good serious role, I did not like him before in About Last Night. He was very good in Gang Related with Tupac too. Kelly Lynch, you have to like it. Well, I do. I only wonder what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
