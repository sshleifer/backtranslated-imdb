I saw that at "Dances with Films", and it was great. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only are your parents getting divorced, but there is a monster after you. <br /> <br /> It was both sincere and scary - there were several moments when the audience shouted with real fright. It reminded me of a Japanese horror movie, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And that's what separates "Jake's Closet" from the usual pabulum indy movie - an excellent script with compelling characters. In addition, by mixing elements of the horror film with a family drama, the film makes the best of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If the movie is not showing in theaters, get the DVD. .
