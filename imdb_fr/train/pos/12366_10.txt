Beautiful film, one of the best horror movies of the 70s. It is sets and realistic atmospheres. As usual, the usual negative comments were inevitable. I have noticed that most horror movies of a certain period do not even reach sufficiency. Obviously, because most horror movies are old and have to be denigrated, it's like a mental mechanism that awakens the spirit of the potential of music critics. <br /> <br /> Before reading this review, already knew the final judgment. In the movie a good gift because 10 is really well done. Raines reads quite well and the film, as a means of production, reminds me of many Kubrick films. It really impresses. Excellent movie really. I consider a film anthology of the 70s.
