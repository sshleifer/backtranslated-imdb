This film has a special place in my heart, because when I first caught it, I taught adult literacy. This sounded very true to me and even to an outstanding student I had at the time. There are scenes that make you swallow with sudden emotion, and others that even put a smile on your face through pure identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances of Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, ranked as the best of their works, a great tour of the young Martha Plimpton, an inspiring story and a haunting musical score make it an experience of more enjoyable and rewarding.
