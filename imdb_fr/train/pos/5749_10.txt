I want to warn you that this comment has a very sweet-bitter quality. In addition, this comment will be much more meaningful to you after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Although tragically sad to say, this film has a resemblance to my life so striking that it is really scary. The rest of you will never know how accurately this film describes how people who have experienced such a situation act and react in their subsequent lives. <br /> <br /> It could not have been a work of fiction; it had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testimony of the quality of the film is illustrated by the fact that even though it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, my life portrayed on the big screen was an experience so painful and painful that I will never be able to see her again. <br /> <br /> But I approve of it wholeheartedly, as a chance to delve into the soul of another human being. to the extent that you have probably never experienced it before or will never see again. I know it for a fact, because it is my soul that you will observe.
