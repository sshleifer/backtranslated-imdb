My left foot is a remarkable epic film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown, suffering from cerebral palsy, a severe disability and having only the use of his left foot. But he was provocative, he managed to become an artist and a writer against all. the odds that I have seen this movie a lot of times and every time I see it, I find it as brilliant every time. I wonder how this amazing movie did not win a Bite for the best picture, is a disaster by the prices of the academy. Jim Shirdan is for me one of the greatest directors in the world. The script, the music and all the rest are excellent in this film. As the movie progresses, you will feel almost in the dark household while everything is going on. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing parents of Cristies and Fiona Shaw is as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in her challenge fight. Before my left foot, the Irish film industry had not spoken much about its name. My left foot marked the beginning of a wonderful period in Irish cinema. Films as powerful and brilliant as the movie, The Game, on behalf of the father, and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films were considered so prestigious around the world and have been nominated for several Oscars. My left foot is a remarkable and powerful film. <br /> <br /> Daniel day-lewis plays so well and so brilliantly Christy Brown, just like Hugh o Conner, who plays the young Christy.To These two performances are among the best of all time, especially that of Daniel Day-Lewis, whom I would call as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel day-lewis has proven during his career that he was an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> it's an excellent masterpiece of cinema, see it!
