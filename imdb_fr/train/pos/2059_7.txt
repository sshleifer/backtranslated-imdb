What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is an original and distinct. It really brought me back to the monsters of the 80s. The budget is obviously weak and Pacino is not necessarily behind, but it does not matter, because it is never taken seriously. From the trash trailer to the scarecrow's high-flying martial arts moves, this is truly a jewel of movie B. Grab some refreshments, snacks and some friends and relax. I liked it so much that I went out and bought the 3 Scarecrow films. Of course, they are not for everyone but for everyone's sake Sometimes, just set the course of thoughts and smile.
