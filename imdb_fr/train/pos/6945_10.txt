My favorite film genre is the western, it's really the only genre of American film. And despite Sergio Leone, nobody really treats them like Americans. <br /> <br /> At the top of my list of top ten westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first couple and the only black and white film of the partnership. Director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a historical film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a normal Universal salary. Many of these transactions followed for the players, making them as rich as the bosses that used them. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann had until now mainly shot B-pictures, of the black genre without a real budget. Just before Winchester 73, Mann had made an excellent western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, which never won enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart had to see him and decided that Mann was the person he had decided to partner with. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mann also set up a mini-society of values ​​for which John Ford was legendary. In addition to Stewart, other actors such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in future Mann films. <br /> <br /> It's a simple conspiracy, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why I will not say anything, but so far we've never seen James Stewart's cold rage on the screen. Anthony Mann has penetrated the soul of Jimmy Stewart and chased some demons. We are all afraid of having it. <br /> <br /> The hate is precisely demonstrated in a big moment towards the beginning of the film. After Stewart and his sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because the weapons are not carried in Earp's Dodge City. There is a shooting competition for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the favorite of the bets is the Dutchman Henry Brown, played with threat by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell, and Geer enter the living room and Stewart and McNally spotted each other at the same time and managed to draw weapons that were not there. Look at the close-ups of Stewart and McNally, they say more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character Stewart meets in the film is Waco Johnny Dean portrayed by Dan Duryea, who almost steals the movie. This is perhaps the best moment of Duryea on the screen. He's a psycho-off-the-law killer who is mortal in a left-handed draw even though he carries two guns. <br /> <br /> Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters. Her fiance is pushed into a showdown by Duryea and is killed. His best scenes are with Duryea, who likes him a lot. She plays to save time until she can get away from him safely. Guess who she ends up with? <br /> <br /> There are magnificent performances in small roles, there is no sour note in the cast. John McIntire as a hesitant Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as a Graying Army Sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first notice as a young Indian Chief. Even John Alexander, better known as "Theodore Roosevelt" in Arsenic and Old Lace, plays a brief but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where McNally and Stewart stop at different times. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart made eight films together, including five westerns, and was ready to make a sixth Western, Night Passage, when they quarreled and Mann left the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced quality films.
