In 1994, I had a very long vacation around the 4th of July - about 17 days off in a row, with two weeks of paid vacation, on weekends and holidays. I stayed in town at that time, I often hung out at my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I did not have a television in my apartment, so I looked at the tube of my parents. I had just watched a segment of X Files when a program called Personal FX is launched. I became addicted instantly. I have always been fascinated by the objects in our house that came from my parents' family home and inheritance from the parent estate, and I often wondered about their history, value, and so on. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation, I went to my parents' house at lunch time to catch Personal FX. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode in which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that Once these renovations were over, Personl FX would be back in the air. <br /> <br /> This has never been the case! Personal FX was the first - and the best - collectible lounges. And it disappeared from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I am still sore. <br /> <br /> Bravo, FX.
