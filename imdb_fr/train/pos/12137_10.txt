It's amazing this movie! I have seen it over and over again over the years and I am always fascinated by it. The reason the film is so easy to watch is of course the striking performance of young Bette Davis. She steals not only every scene she's in, but she's actually a lot prettier and better photographed here (to say the most sexy) than she was in any of the movies she's made up to date. now in his studio, Warner Brothers (this film was directed by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering makeup and has very attractive hairstyles and, oh, those beautiful big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in the Soho of London). Her body was so sinuous when she was young. Get a load of it in the cheap neglected she wears for her big scene of explosive confrontation with Leslie Howard. And oh boy, she's an absolute power in this scene. Howard is always a little nervous, but he captures the sensitivity of the hero. Frances Dee is the sweet and pretty girl Sally who really loves him. The score of Max Steiner is both charming and poignant. The splendid performance and flavor of the 1930s make it the must-see version of the classic novel.
