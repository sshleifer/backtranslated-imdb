Canadian director Vincenzo Natali stormed the art studio circuit with the intriguing and surprisingly clever Cube, which is my favorite SF movie in the '90s. He framed the basic pretension of a group of foreigners trapped in a giant cube-shaped labyrinth, shot entirely on a game, and took this idea in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to Natali's follow-up and, although it took her five years to get another project done, I'm glad to say it was worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of a man's place in the world and how he finds himself in a completely logical chain of events in a situation beyond his control. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say more about you. the plot, because one of the joys of Cypher resides in the different avenues that it makes us descend. It's so refreshing to see an SF movie that has more than one idea in mind. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the dullest people on the planet, is hired by DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars. To his amazement, they are incredibly boring. Covering topics as banal as shaving cream and cheese. <br /> <br /> While waiting for a seminar, Morgan clashes with Rita Foster (Lucy Liu immaculately melted), definition of the girl ice cream. She gives him the brush, but he has something that he finds irresistible. This is not surprising considering her lifeless marriage. <br /> <br /> When Rita arrives at another Morgan seminar, she will tell him that her life is not what she seems. And I say nothing more about the plot. This would reduce the impact that the rest of the film has on us, as well as the winding path that is so fun to follow. <br /> <br /> Like Cube, Natali has a great talent for encompassing an ordinary appearance. people, taking them out of what is familiar to them and seeing essentially what will happen when they are plunged into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But it's not a true copy of Cube. He has his own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a movie that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories. One of the great benefits of Cypher is that these themes are part of history without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes that his false identity is a piece of a much bigger puzzle, it's a shock for us as much as for him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes Cypher Cube is its quality of finish is. Where Cube was confined to a minimalist framework and a small budget with a plethora of unknowns, Cypher also has a reduced budget, but Natali saves as much as he can, allowing him to expand his horizon and launch Morgan on an extraordinary journey. through the labyrinth of his own identity. <br /> <br /> Natali's management is exceptional, with a skillful hand on the reins. There are incredible camera angles seen from above, such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a large, robust office building associated with Morgan's tiny black dot. All the color seems to have been bleeding from the image, which perfectly complements the tone of the film like a modern film noir. <br /> <br /> The acting game is uniformly excellent. Jeremy Northam is a likeable figure who goes from his loveless marriage to challenging his own identity. His performance is excellent because it is so modulated. It literally seems to change before our eyes. From a clinical idiot to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett makes a welcome appearance that has had such an impact in Cube. He lives in a secret silo that seems to have been borrowed from Men in Black. His stage is one of the best because it is a carefully calculated exercise of suspense and paranoia. He is a supposed expert in the identification of double agents and it is a fantastic writing, brilliantly interpreted by Hewlett. All he has to do is watch Morgan and we train in his complex mind game. <br /> <br /> But Lucy Liu is the thief of scenes here. Too often, she plays in movies where her potential is not fully exploited. But at Cypher, we finally give him a character that suits him like a glove. Rita is an isolated and supervised femme fatale that Liu lives with delight. I rejoiced every time she appeared, because she was always in control and could reduce a room to silence by the sheer power of her icy gaze. <br /> <br /> Things end in a very rewarding way, it does not happen. conclude on an ambiguous note like Cube. But Morgan deserves a happy ending. After he was put in the shoes of this genre, I encouraged him in the final scene. It's a perfect final moment, as it is a ray of sunshine after 90 minutes of gloom. <br /> <br /> Cypher succeeds in every respect. Engaging, shocking, always entertaining, that's all Total Recall wanted to be but was not. And it comes as a refreshing antidote against the overwhelming and inexplicable womb. <br /> <br /> A beautiful suite of Natali. And now I am a convinced fan of this man. Stunning stuff!
