This is by far one of the best-made films and has not left me disappointed at all. The soundtrack with the camera work held in hand with precision was exquisite. There is always a chance that a film does not take into account his convictions, but I felt that the rhythm of this picture and the timing were excellent. Dakota Fanning is fast becoming a fixture in movies requiring a child with an old personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. As for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken, both of them go beyond the challenge of showing the darker side of humanity by trying to get to the light.
