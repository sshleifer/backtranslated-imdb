Although it's a pretty enjoyable musical, this film keeps me in mind of the unexpected comedy chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as a composer emeritus, and Oscar Levant as an assistant. Playing a very tense and distracted artistic type (far from his more familiar roles of threatening villains or Sherlock Holmes with disconcerting logic), the character of Rathbone seems to be unable to get out of bed without help. And this help is Starbuck, played with his usual funny humor of Oscar Levant. After hiring Crosby as a ghostly songwriter, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck saying, "He's thinking for me," and Levant replies, "Ah, this is just part-time work." Of course, it goes right behind Rathbone (who is too busy worrying about where his next tube comes from.) As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny! no more opportunities to display his comic talent.
