It's a really beautiful and heart-wrenching movie !!!! The places of Ripstein are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinary García Márquez, there is no doubt. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes offer remarkable performances as a colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You must see it !!!
