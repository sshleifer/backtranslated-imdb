Before reading this article, I must emphasize that this is by no means a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something about it, hopefully, I'm against politicians in general .. but if you want to be offended ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran, because this film is forbidden (see the IMDb trivia for this film). Which is a shame, because the movie is great. Would not it be for "Grbavica", this film would have been won at the Berlin International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Rightly (it was the second prize, or the second place if you prefer). Why? Because it's a film about oppression. It's not even that it's a complete female problem. It is about the fact that the government is trying to contain people. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by prohibiting it, nothing is solved and / or can they make this film disappear! <br /> <br /> Another speaker had a recap phrase: "A comedy about a tragedy", which sums up the situation!
