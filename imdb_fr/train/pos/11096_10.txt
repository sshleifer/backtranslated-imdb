Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. The story: A businessman is blackmailed by 3 criminals. Roy Schieder does a great job as a main character and special credits have to be awarded to John Glover, who plays somehow a nasty psychopath. I must mention that the characters of the bad guys are very complex and interesting - which is very rare for an action movie. also features beautiful and sexy women - the most notable being Kelly Preston, the young star of Schieder's character. Vanity gives very good performance and a beautiful appearance as a hooker connected to the three singers. I'm happy to say that Margaret has not lost her yet - this lady is a real girl. Do not watch the rate of this movie. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this film, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this film really captivating and underrated. You will enjoy it, it's a promise. A + recommended.
