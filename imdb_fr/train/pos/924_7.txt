The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: it's funny, witty and offers a great role play. The show is about the family of a lion who plays the role of attraction of Siegfried & Roy's shows. Indeed, all are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny. FOTP is not a children's cartoon, it contains a bit of brutal humor for adults, but in a very sweet way. It is full of references to popular culture and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed. I would say that I will give 7 out of 10 to the series because it's pretty, pretty well executed but not very original, I've seen most of these stereotypes several times, even in this particular order!
