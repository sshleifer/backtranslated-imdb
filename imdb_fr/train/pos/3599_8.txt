This film is a real gem. The arc of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are nice and clearly drawn, their motives quite credible. The dialogue is fresh and so real. The situations are unique to the characters and not at all clich√©d or ridiculed. Until the culmination, it is. Then, it's as if the movie skidded a bit and became a little hokey and amazing. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first 3/4 are really remarkable. I gave him an 8. There are some outstanding performances here. Discover this movie.
