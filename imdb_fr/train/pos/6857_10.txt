"Dressed To Kill", is one of the best thrillers ever made. His relationships with sex and violence make him an adult film. Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can compete with his use of the camera to tell a story. He directs many scenes without dialogue, and he tells much of his story, strictly using his visual elements, and the brilliant score of Pino Donnagio. Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen on the big screen because De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell his story. Cropped, in video, "Dressed To Kill", is hardly the same movie. The solid performances of his casting, his superb direction and, perhaps, the best score ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" a must.
