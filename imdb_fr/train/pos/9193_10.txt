It is very faithful to the original manga of the same name, aka Tramps Like Us in the United States, but it can still be enjoyed even if you have not read the manga. It's a different kind of tail, showing a strong, independent woman who hurts like everyone else. However, because of her external strength, she is afraid to show her inner feelings and thus lets those around her hurt her with their direct comments. The only person who really understands her and who she can be comfortable with is her new pet ... human ... Momo. If you want something different from the usual boring stuff with wonderful actors / feelings from J-Dorama (Japanese drama), this is definitely the series to watch ... and read!
