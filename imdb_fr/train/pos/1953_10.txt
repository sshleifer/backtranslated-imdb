Since this film was based on the true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well off, it was scary to see how real it was! The acting is what gave the film a sense of greatness. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton described the main character, Patsy McCartle, who had two sons whom she adored. It is his performance that brought the real story to life on a television screen. It was very difficult to watch certain scenes because they were so real about what happens when you become addicted. <br /> <br /> It was hard to watch this very loving mother go from gentle to indifferent at all, but so true. I know people who have experienced the withdrawal and that is very similar to what happened in this film, from what I remember. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was very risky for the director to want to make a film of what happened to this woman. Still, it was so well done. I congratulate the director for making this film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or who wants to know what can happen to you if you become addicted to this drug. .
