I just watched this movie on Showtime. Quite by accident actually. If I had not slept for six hours in the last two days, I would not be home sooner. If I had not come back from work early, I would not have seen this movie. I would not have known what was missing, but I would have missed a lot. <br /> <br /> That's how this movie happens. We play almost on Kevin Bacon effect. This and the causality (hence my verbiage above). All characters are linked in one way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, non-interaction. This film is just wonderful. I will have to find a copy to buy.
