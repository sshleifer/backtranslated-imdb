The story is about Jet Li, who has to fight against his old <br /> <br /> friends. But there is a problem, the friends are surface controllers. The film is filled with blood, super action and the best stunts forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is an excellent co-actor. Of course, the movie has the typical HK-Fun.But I love it! In Germany, "Black Mask" is uncut.
