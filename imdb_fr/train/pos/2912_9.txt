We use the term "superstar" way too lightly these days, but here's a guy who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was stuck to the scenery of this show. The song selection was perfect - it only contained the songs I really wanted to hear and was accompanied by documentary footage during the new weakest songs. I loved the fact that the band is only five people on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength, you do not need a circus to entertain you.) <br /> <br /> The images of the crowd were also amazing. How many performers can affect the original Beatles fans (now in their fifties and beyond), encourage young kids to get started on the front lines of "Can not Buy Me Love" and make an impact on everyone. between them? <br /> <br /> While watching, I also realized that, in the wake of John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney immediately became an afterthought. Paul not only lost John and George (regardless of their final relationship, it must be difficult to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife Linda and never really seemed to collect the recognition of Lennon's murder. I agree that Lennon's murder was horrible, but it's only now that I realized that Paul had somehow been forgotten afterwards. I was very happy he found Heather's love again. <br /> <br /> As for those who complain about the audio / video quality, I have no complaints to make; both were limpid on my tray. I think these same people will complain about the quality of the DVD when the next format comes out; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> My only regret was not to buy a ticket for this show when I had the opportunity. Thanks to this video, I was able to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will remember his murder and his music first. I now have a new appreciation of Paul McCartney, because he will be remembered first of all for his music. And let's hope another lunatic will not change that, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
