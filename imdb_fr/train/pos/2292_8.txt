I just watched Bugs Bunny (the first time he's named here) and Elmer Fudd's cartoon on ThadBlog, which is linked to YouTube. It was the first time that Chuck Jones directed the film "wascally wabbit". Therefore, the voice of Bugs is different from that of Mel Blanc to the Brooklyn / Bronx we know better. In fact, according to Thad, he channels Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" type personality at the time). Anyway, after Elmer bought her pet, Bugs makes her life odious by turning on the radio very loudly, claiming to die after her master repeatedly throws her out of her shower and tells her, " Turn off those lights! " every time Elmer catches her in bed. Even with the different voice, Bugs is definitely his naughty me and I burst out laughing all the time! According to Thad, there was an extra scene at the end of Elmer, who gave the house to Bugs after hell, but it was probably too sad because he was suffering from mental depression at that time, so is as well this scene is lost. Anyway, I highly recommend El Rabins Pet Rabbit.
