If your idea of ​​a thriller is a car chase, explosions and dozens of people crushed by gunshots, then "House of Games" is definitely not the film for you. If you like and enjoy psychological drama and suspense, do not hesitate to consult it. <br /> <br /> "The House of Games" tells the story of a famous psychologist and writer, Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the dark world crooks led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say more about the plot would spoil the suspense. Frankly, I can not believe anyone who says he saw the twists. Just like a clever rogue, this film takes you to his canvas and lowers your alertness. <br /> <br /> The story is tense and well done, the dialogue is intelligent and laconic, the game is uniform (Mantegna is superbly charismatic). Some complained that Dr. Ford was not a very friendly character and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and distant; moreover, his homosexuality is somehow essential to the plot (at one point, I think that an injury to his sexual self-esteem is a key element of his motivation ... I do not say more) . <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a dark look on the underside of human nature that ends on a note of embarrassing ambiguity. It will hold your attention every second while you watch and will stay long after you.
