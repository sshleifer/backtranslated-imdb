Fay Grim is a real example of what I call a finished puzzle movie. He has all the qualities of actor, direction, scenario and entertainment. Fay Grim then forms a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> This film follows a single mother, Fay Grim, who tries to raise her son so as not to become his father who fled justice. and disappeared. Soon, the CIA contacted Fay on a desperate quest to find 8 newspapers from her husband, Henry. These newspapers were filled with confessions from his long history with the CIA and his involvement in countries and their government activities. Fay is sent to search for these newspapers, in exchange for his brother's release from prison, and a cat-and-mouse hunt all over Europe to retrieve these newspapers and learn the hidden secrets of his life. husband, whom she had never heard of. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey had already been an actress I liked since I watched her in The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought vivacity to her two comedic roles, but Fay Grim was a very different role from the two other films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I was looking for her and I wanted to know more. She grabs you while she is on screen and when she is away, you can not help but think about what's happening to her. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any work by author / director Hal Hartley yet, but I think I'll watch some of his previous films if they're half as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a smart movie choice the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD, I strongly encourage you to choose Fay Grim. If you have any sense of what a movie should be, you'll appreciate it a lot.
