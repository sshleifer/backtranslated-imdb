It was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was about 5 years old at the time. It scared me GOOD! But that night, I put chewing gum in one eye to be like a monster ... and my mother was very upset. She had to clean my eyes with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT! NOW IT'S A FILM! Hi, it was time for a good movie. This head sitting on the counter of the laboratory was as real as it was then. And if your 5 is very scary! Today, children are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing to the imagination of your mind. Your mind can imagine more frightening things than special effects! (IMO)
