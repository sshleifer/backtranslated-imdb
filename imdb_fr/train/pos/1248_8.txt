"The Golden Child" is Eddie Murphy's first film since his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And even if it's not as good as "Cop", it's a funny comic adventure. Murphy plays the role of discoverer of stray children to whom a very unusual case has been attributed. His mission: to find the main character, a child with mystical powers. This film could have been titled "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom" because some parts of the film unfold like a Spielbergian adventure, much like an Indiana Jones comedy. It's a comedy with bursts of laughter and an adventure with special effects. A lot of pleasure. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
