Well, I was not sure what the movie was going to be because I only saw a little clip but I thought it was going to be good and I was right, I watched it twice a day where I got it and it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played very well the role of Beth, she is a high quality actress and the writer had to start a lot of research to know more about bulimia, although the end when beth is in the hospital, 2 Horus were observed after meals because I was told that a house was good and that hospitals did not help bulimics, which is probably why I am always at home while my sister and mother would like to be hospitalized like bulimia but it's a movie grate that I recommend to anyone with or without an eating disorder eating disorders because this can let them into the life of a person bulimic and see the world how they do a little bit about a grid movie and I recommend it to everyone and any kind of person
