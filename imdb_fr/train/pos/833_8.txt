First, let me say that the director uses the titles beautifully in his shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but I must say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is rather dull. Brosnan blends so well into this character, that it's really hard to remember that this is the same guy playing the link. He also shows his range and depth as an actor. It's a bit of an independent film and it was really nice to see, especially with all the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year. I found the characters well designed. The twist in the middle that I felt was particularly good. I also liked the realistic way the characters stand out. So many times we have in the film these caricatures of characters who are not really characters but itinerant stereotypes ... I like the different approaches of this film. I think the side when I think of this film but I think it is more observable and a better film as a whole ...
