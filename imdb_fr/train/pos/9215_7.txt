What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and worshiping siren cults? Tobe Hooper tries to answer this question in a strange little movie. <br /> <br /> Genie is a cute girl who visits her nerdy archeologist father in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie is caught by a mysterious prostitute (and a blatant lesbian) who serves daddy aside. Dad is sent back to the site, where he discovers a grave with what appears to be a mermaid. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade and cracks for a hunky Egyptian (providing the hottest scenes of the film). Finally, Genie discovers that she must be a sacrifice and that the prolonged and bloody climax begins. A story of the Marquis de Sade in prison, surrounded by this story, traces a portrait of what looks like Genius. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is great for both the Marquis and his offspring. His acting skills have always been neglected by his makeup requirements, so he is allowed to shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", if you have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including the young Genie, is pretty and mean. The script, however, is problematic. You will quickly learn that the scenes of marquis are completely useless, except perhaps that the filmmakers had access to the decor. The siren cult that ultimately saves Genie makes absolutely no sense. Who is the mermaid is never explained, and its link with Christianity (which is put forward throughout the film) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, the archaeologist is a biblical father, but he likes to be tied up by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably had no idea what the writers were trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> So, why do I recommend this movie? It's strange. There is an extended sex scene. For the ladies, the very Egyptian rides a horse completely naked. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This film is full of it. It's like Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Knowing Hooper has somehow resulted in "Crocodile" after that rather sad. "The night terrors" is not perfect, but certainly deserves a shady and careless look. <br /> <br /> This is noted (D) for physical abuse, some sexual abuse, gore, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references, and substance abuse. <br /> <br />
