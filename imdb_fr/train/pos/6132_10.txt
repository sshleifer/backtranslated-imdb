I'm glad the users (as of today) who liked this movie are moving forward now. I do not understand people who did not like this movie - it looks like they were expecting serious treatment (?!?!?)! Come on, how can you take seriously the premise of a killer snowman? The filmmakers knew it was a ridiculous premise and they did not try to deny it. The rendering of the scenes unequivocally makes it FUNNY! Yes, there are times when low-budget shows (such as this explosion scene), but I think an expensive look would have removed the fun of the movie! So, if you like B movies, and that wacky places appeal to you, then you'll definitely like "Jack Frost".
