Made me wish my happy birds could talk. Tisk Tisk on the critic who dissed the film. A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a nice little treasure. He has some smart lines that really made me laugh. I particularly liked the dance sequences during his showbiz. You can forget the obvious clich√©s by encouraging him in his quest to find Marie. A charming film featuring two strong characters who befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner. Would have liked to see more of the woman who becomes blind and must give up their mutual journey. I loved her artistic and poetic inspirations, a pity she can not share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home, finally with Marie, perhaps joined by the kind young man who helped him defeat the opponents to complete his journey.
