Yes, it's true. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange controller have both been designed so that this game can be created. It was amazing the first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and it's amazing now. The game control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and the charm of Nintendo is still as intangible, but undeniably. Necessary for any owner of N64 and reason to get an N64 for everyone.
