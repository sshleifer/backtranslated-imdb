This film begins with a family that was all going in different directions and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very in love with Joe MacLeod (Zack). The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture (Jill Dunne) who is suddenly approaching her daughter and Zack kissing, then all sorts of problems seem to surface. Jill Dunne has a husband who travels or often stays away from home. There are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go camping, which their daughter Olivia does not like and simply can not adapt to the possibility of sleeping outside and requires that a tent is kept outside all insects. In many ways, Olivia achieves an outstanding performance as a teenager and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) plays an important supporting role as a hotel owner. This film will let you guess how it will end and you will enjoy a movie full of horror and terror. Enjoy
