... Hawk Heaven for French film lovers and, by extension, French actors / actresses. In the worst case, it is an indulgence: actors talking with other actors, question the merits of a profession, etc. while, at best, it is a glorious celebration / sending of some of the best actors currently working. From the simple premise - the request of Jean-Pierre Marielle for the water to be ignored in a restaurant - Blier turns in all directions and allows the cream of the French cinema to strut in front of the camera even by nodding to those who are no longer there (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura), including the director's father, Bernard, one of the great pillars of French cinema, to whom he addresses a celestial phone call at the end of the film. Discursive and prolix, yes, guilty but also a guilty pleasure.
