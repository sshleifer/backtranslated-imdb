As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I gladly came out with all my expectations satisfied. It was funny, sweet, fast and entertaining. The film begins with two cabs (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same place, wondering what direction to take. It was funny, and then the film presents some of the best sketches I've ever seen. There were four amazing ones among all the good ones. I will start talking about these four people. One of them represents Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel that finds love with an old lady. The next Orlando Bloom watch as a musician doing business with a woman performed by Christina Ricci. Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly are two other people who go to the prom, the character of Thirbly being disabled. The best presents Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an old couple bickering. I will draw your attention to the fact that Nataile Portman is making an impressive director debut and writing a skit about a guardian. Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as flirtors and prostitutes. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the Paris Je'Taime 2006. The skits are well paced and the film shows how independent films should be. However, the film does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which explains why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see great dramatic effects, see an incredible amount of great performances, and just be entertained, then definitely go to New York, I Love You.
