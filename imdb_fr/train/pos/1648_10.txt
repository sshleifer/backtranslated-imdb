It's one of the best movies ever made. This is a realistic portrayal of life in rural ranching that was integral to American history. We are in Wyoming in 1906, where life has hardly changed since the previous century. The film keeps your interest without the Hollywood myths. The whole family can watch this film and become intrigued by the life of the United States when it was essentially a rural nation. With this movie, you will escape the present and witness the centenary of everyday life. In a beautiful and picturesque environment, you will see the hard physical work necessary to survive, as well as the constant concerns and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make the difference between success and failure. Watch this movie and live life as it has been for most of our country's history. This film is worth your time to see. My only question is: why are there not more movies like this?
