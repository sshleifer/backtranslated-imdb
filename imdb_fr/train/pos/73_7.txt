It is essentially a variation of House Of Wax, both in the plot and in the type of role played by the star of the two films, Vincent Price. In both images, he embodies a talented artist who is projected to sink into madness when his creations are usurped by other less talented and less scrupulous people. In this film, he embodies an illusionist for performing magicians who aspires to embark on an acting career before being frustrated when another illusionist, the Grand Rinaldo (John Emery) insists he respects his contract and gives him the first choice of all the illusions that he conceives.Price is already ill disposed towards Rinaldi, his ex-wife being from now on a lover of Rinaldi. He deploys his talents as an illusionist and brilliant imitator to take revenge on Rinaldi and others who defeat his recognition projects as an interpreter and designer. <br /> <br /> The price is pretty much all the show here and gives a well-judged star turns into an injured man whose situation pleases the audience. The rest of the cast is competent if he is colorless and the burden of the adventure weighs on Price who carries the burden with ease. <br /> <br /> While a solid B movie melodrama, it's a detective rather than horror film. It is nice provided you do not expect a masterpiece. In black and white, it is little gore and is better as a melodrama and appreciated for its presence. star giving idiosyncratic performance
