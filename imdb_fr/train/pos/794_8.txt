I was very surprised to see how much I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a film MacDowell did not make her beauty another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is nice to watch and runs very well. His relationship with his friends is both a thorn and a balm in his life. Imelda Stalinson, who has been MVP in many British films, is doing a great job in this area. There is a tragedy to this, but I think the film is finally saved by its brilliant acting, its own sense and a spiritual writing. The quality of the film is excellent and the music is good, even if it is not available in soundtrack.
