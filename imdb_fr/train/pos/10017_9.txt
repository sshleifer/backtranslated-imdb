I absolutely loved this movie! I have no connection with all the other comments I have read about it. I was completely captivated by every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story captivating, the intense acting and the sense of direction. I would jump literally every time the phone rings towards the end of the movie. Although there was nothing "scary" in the story itself, I was throughout the movie - and the rest of the evening. <br /> <br /> I noticed that there were so many perfect choices to make ... the cast, the script, the little bits of humor that were scattered there. There have been so many moments when the film could have been a cheap thrill, but it never was, and it put me on top of so many mediocre thrillers that came out recently ... and for the last number of years.
