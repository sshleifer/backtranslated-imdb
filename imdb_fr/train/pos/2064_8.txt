The ScareCrow was one of the funniest killers I've ever seen in the act! In addition, he really jumped most of the time, which was great! Besides, he had an excellent voice, I mean it was just perfect for him. The story was excellent too. I love how the soul of children was transferred to ScareCrow, it was cool! Plus, he had a reason for all this murder I want to say after what these people did to him ..... I would be angry too! The look of ScareCrows was really good! his gaze gives this person an "OMG!" reaction when they see it! What was great, the looks he had were funny! These people were stupid, who would look for so long! They should take a look and save their life ... even if it would not have made a difference!
