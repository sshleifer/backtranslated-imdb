It's one of the best Indian movies I've seen recently, instead of rotten songs and dance movies or slum dogs. All the actors showed the good emotions, the good intensity and the good timing. This is the mark of a good movie, to bring back the viewer in search of the subject, which I exactly checked on Harilal. I still enjoy Akshay Khanna's subtle playing style and, oddly enough, he had a rather complicated relationship with his own father, Vinod Khanna, although not as dramatic as Gandhis and wonders how that helped him to put that. character on trial. I was impressed by the direction and congratulations to Anil Kapoor for producing such an elegant film.
