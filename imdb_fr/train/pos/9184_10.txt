Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) And it has a somewhat dated feel, but the casting and acting are so brilliant that you will not want to look at other versions! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester ... it's as simple as that. I do not care if other critics say it's too good. Dalton is attractive, certainly, but no handsome boy. In fact, it has a dark charm, angular and steep, which, in my opinion, corresponds quite to the mysterious MR, very masculine. And he poignantly assumes the sad and tortured character of Rochester. He describes the ferocity when the scene calls him, but also shows the tender, passionate and emotional side of Rochester. (OMI, A & E's new production, suffers from the fact that Ciaran Hinds - which I adore normally - seems to stammer and tyrannize everywhere.I read the book several times and never thought that Rochester was supposed to to be perceived as a snarling beast.) <br /> <br /> When I reread the novel, I still see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Ms. Clarke, for me, looks like Jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). Little, child, fairy ... although the actress does not look to be 18, she describes Jane's attributes so well. While other critics have claimed that his acting was wooden or emotionless, one must not forget that the character spent 8 years in Lowood, where he was trained to master his emotions and his "passionate nature ". Her main inspiration was her childhood friend, Helen, who was the image of a wise submission. Although her true nature is different, Jane learned to master her temper and be docile, in keeping with the school's goals for her charitable students who would be "served". Jane becomes a housekeeper in the home of wealthy Mr. Rochester. She would certainly not speak to him as an equal. Even later, when she gave as well as she had, she would always remember that her job was well below that of her employer. Nevertheless, if you read the book - to which this production remains surprisingly close - you can clearly see the small difficulties that Zelah-as-Jane experiences as she controls her emotions to stay soft and temperate. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is right, I think. No, it does not look like Hollywood at all (thank God it's not a Hollywood book), but their novel is a true, dedicated and loyal love story. And for a woman like Jane, who never assumed that there was love, it's a minor miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is fantastic, and I love the fact that almost the book's character is here. The same is true for the rich and poetic original dialogue. This version is the only one I know to include the beautiful and famous "gypsy scene" and, in general, presents more humor than the other versions I have seen. In particular, the mutual jokes between the main characters come directly from the book and are so delicious! <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre was, in many ways, one of the first romantic feminists. She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently, and finally, as Rochester's true equal. Just wonderful!
