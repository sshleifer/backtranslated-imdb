Exquisite comedy starring Marian Davies (with the affable William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood in search of fame. Cameo's performances present "all the stars of MGM's paradise" in the famous commissioners' stage, as well as many details of making period films for the scholar. Pic also captures for posterity the famous sarcastic imitations of the stars of the day (his Swanson is a beauty!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy" is surprised even when meeting the famous tennis star Marian Davies looks up and comments: "Oh, I do not like it!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. A story, a staging, an authentic charm and a must for all lovers of silence.
