I saw Soylent Green in 1973, at the time of his release, and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video. It has always been one of my favorite sci-fi and / or Charlton Heston movies. <br /> <br /> Recently, L.A.'s Egyptian theater had a retrospective of twelve films about Charlton Heston. I arrived by plane to see six films over a two-day period. Soylent Green looked great on the big Egyptian screen with a new perfect print. The movie was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston, a cop who lives in a devastated world, has few natural resources and does not understand how the world was once and Eddie Robinson, as a man who remembers from the past, is great. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry is wonderful. The film is also much better in a superb 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen and the cinematheque, the writing, the music used, etc. The film is also very powerful in its dark and very possible vision of the future. Just think of the growth of the world's population, the disappearance of the rainforest, the use of resources and the worsening of the greenhouse effect since 1973. I just wonder why this film was not been presented indoors all these years. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> About reputation, people often speak as if Charlton Heston was not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, the warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee, I'm sure he's one of our best actors. Of course, he has shot a dozen other great movies and for those who care, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
