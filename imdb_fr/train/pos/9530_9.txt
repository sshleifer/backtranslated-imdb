Conrad Hall came out with a bang. The great film photographer has completed his illustrious career with this film before moving on to something else. He is proud of him because it is one of the best crime movies you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Of course, playing is not bad when Tom Hanks and Paul Newman play the lead roles! The amount of action here is also right: not too much; not too little. <br /> <br /> None of the characters here, frankly, are "good guys" because Hanks is a professional hit-man for the city's boss, Newman. The only quality that buys Hanks is not to want his young son to become a killer like him, although he teaches him to become the suspect of thefts! Huh? <br /> <br /> As interesting and interesting as the story may be, the real star of this film is the director of photography, Hall, who paints from stage to stage with his lens. His work is just awesome.
