This movie changed everything for me ... I heard about breakdancing and hiphop, but I had never seen it done professionally (hey, I was an 11 year old kid from Holland!). When I saw this movie, everything changed. I was actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city, I started to breakdance and write lyrics. To this day, I still consider this film as a personal favorite. Of course, cinematographic and cinematographic importance may not be so important. But who cares whether the wide shot was badly filmed or if you could see a microphone hanging over someone? That's what it's for you personally that counts ...
