A jewel of comedy. Lots of giggles, shop and pub scenes made me laugh uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue well observed - I know people like that! The humor is surprisingly sweet and the film (it may sound strange) makes me think of an Ealing comedy. It's a little original movie with a lot of details. It certainly takes a number of views. I watched it several times (I showed all my friends!) And I noticed something new every time: a little dialogue, a visual that I had not noticed before. I could be very difficult and find some flaws in the film, but I will not do it because, overall, it's a very fun and enjoyable movie that is definitely worth watching and anyone with the sense of humor must appreciate. It's a film that will find his friends and I hope there are many. Oh .... and he has an excellent soundtrack.
