As a warning, I have seen the film 5 to 6 times in the last 15 years and I just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the film without being tainted by what was or was not in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :)) in this role, with Kasey . I think his "Let me dance for you" scene is one of the best parts of the movie, an interesting addition to the musical. The dancers and vocals in the film are far superior to the musical, as well as the cast that is at least 10 times larger (easier to do in the movie of course). The sets, lighting, dancing and singing are also far superior in the film, which we should expect, and has been delivered well. <br /> <br /> The songs that were common with the musical are better interpreted in the film, the news is pretty good and the film as a whole offers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a movie. a musical that has little scenery. The only negative point of the film is the obvious cuts between the actors who speak and the singers doubled during the sung parts for certain characters, but their dance is impeccable and the final product was more enjoyable than the musical.
