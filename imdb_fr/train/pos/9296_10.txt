I love that movie. It's far-fetched, funny, violent, surreal, played in the head of a madman, and certainly not your usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not find the movie fun, I guess it's just not for your taste, so it's a hard game to write for. <br /> <br /> For reference, Some other comedies that I really like are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (that one only had me the second time). There are others, but I have a taste for the unusual and I am willing to accept that most people do not like that kind of thing. I do not apologize for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters of this film are well assembled, the verbal humor is hilarious, the situations intrigue, the acting is very good (as you might expect from the cast) , although the requirements of the scenario are not particularly high. The overall package offers fun, fun, observable and violent entertainment.
