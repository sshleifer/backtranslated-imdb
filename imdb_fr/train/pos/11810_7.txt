I still liked it. Warren Beatty is just like the hero of comics. What saves this film is the shooting, the incredible casting and it derives from a mediocre scenario. I was really expecting something more substantial in terms of action or conspiracy, but I have very little. The main reason for watching this movie is to watch some of Hollywood's biggest stars at the time in such an unusual film. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a terrible job and who did not even belong to this movie is Madonna. She did not belong to this movie and her acting work was pretty bad. The film at times has remained motionless. You were expecting something more and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a very bad guy and he does very well. Beatty and he is an excellent guy and a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a movie other than Ishar. I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is that it's good, but it could have been so much better. I loved it when I was a child because I found it cool and visually, the film is incredible, the sets are incredible, the writing is right, and with such a cast in the film, I would expect a little better anyway. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I especially thought that the final was not big enough. It was interesting, but for a movie of such magnitude, I thought it could have ended with a little more bang. The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only 7 cartoon colors, which makes it even more visually excellent. <br /> <br /> The costumes and makeup were also impeccable. The face makeup for the bad guys was great. Beatty just does not live up to a character as big as life. Still, it's a good movie that could have been a lot more. It's better for me than Batman, the other comic adaptation that came about at the same time. Of course, this movie was much bigger in rough terms.
