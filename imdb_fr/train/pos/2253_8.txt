I rented this film because of my interest in American history and in particular for the somewhat strange history of the Mormons. This film tries to make sense of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a major world religion. He focuses first on the problems that Mormons experienced when they settled in Navuoo, Illinois. He describes the Joseph Smith trial. During this trial, Brigham Young gets up to talk about his conversion to Mormonism and his conviction of Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is murdered and Young has to face his own doubts as to whether he was chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his serious doubts, he perseveres and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place of his colony) that gives him confidence in the correctness of his leadership. Later, when crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts to have been really chosen. However, a miracle occurs that cements its place in history. the story must be compelling and interesting. I would like to know if the Mormons believe that it is a faithful representation. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why it is at the heart of SDL are not mentioned. The question is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people stay away from this film because of its religious content, but its distribution is excellent and it will always hold your interest.
