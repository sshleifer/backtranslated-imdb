This film is one of those with a resounding familiarity. It is a terrestrial film that will make you think and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully varied and adapted; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. It certainly deserves the recognition of the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that moves away from the obvious love story and frequent special affects that we see today. I never came out of a movie with such deep warmth and a feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart; it was as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket. To see this film is to find a real treasure and enjoy it.
