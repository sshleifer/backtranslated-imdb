For me, this remains one of Superman's best performances on television, as well as one of the most faithful to a period of comics. <br /> <br /> This series paid tribute to the Superman movies of the 70s / 80s and the Superman comic book series "reboot" from 1986 to "(Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics, "" Adventures of Superman, "etc.). The opening score and titles were thrilling, based on John Williams' score of the movies, updated for a Saturday morning action series. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to the reboot of comics (author of "Adventures of Superman") was an ideal choice to participate in this animated series. Overall, the series had a more mature appearance while still being very child-friendly. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as credible, strong and iconic. His recurring enemy was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniacal incarnation / CEO. The characters from Daily Planet, Lois, Jimmy and Perry were well represented. One of my favorite appearances was Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around her home island, Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). His drawing and that of his mother Hippolyte were in harmony with the comic strip series of the same era, Wonder Woman, which had been restarted in the same way, and it seemed like an equally successful animated series could have been developed for her if she was treated the same way. <BR /> <br /> The only thing that is hard to believe is that it was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
