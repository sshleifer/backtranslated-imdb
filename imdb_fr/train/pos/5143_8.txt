With the fast interconnection of crazy scenes in an asylum, the montage / superimposition of images and the vague and intertwined stories, it is a very difficult film to follow. Apparently, a man (Masue Inoue) takes a job porter or concierge in an asylum to be able to approach his imprisoned wife and perhaps even bring to his rescue. But she is clearly angry, huddled on the floor, with an empty expression most of the time, fear, misery and confusion, written on her face the rest of the time. The director sometimes passes her point of view and we see vague images of her at the edge of a pond drowning a baby or holding a child drowned. She is tormented by something. When the point of view turns to her or other madmen, the filmmaker uses deforming lenses, etc., showing us what the crazy people see and how they react. And the place teems with crazy people, laughing, hiding and, in one case, dancing frantically night and day. At one point, the man tries to take his wife outside, but the night in front of the door terrifies her and she returns to her cell. Gradually, the man falls into a nightmare in which he is interrupted in a new attempt to rob her, and he kills the doctor and many assistants, while the madmen laugh and clap. When he wakes up, he is relieved and wipes the floor. Some fascinating pictures of Japanese life, streets, buildings from the 1920s.
