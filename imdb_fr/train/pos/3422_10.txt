I desperately need it on a tape, not on a DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have a nephew who is in the infantry but who has not yet been deployed, although he went to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my hands. son in Ramadi in Iraq on 09/15/05 of an unmanned missile in a green zone. I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as he finishes high school this spring because, like his big brother, he has an idealized and romanticized idea of ​​service in the army. My son-in-law died after only 10 days in the country and he never went on a mission. My nephews therefore have no way of referring to the experiences presented in this candid documentary from personal experiences that my son, now deceased, could have passed on. . <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can do for those who are here or have left, but I still have a man who has not raised his hand and who has been sworn in AGAIN. I desperately want him to know, none of the others have done it. <br /> <br /> Thank you for helping me in this regard. <br /> <br /> The documentary film The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen. I have to make sure that my youngest nephew sees what he's getting into before it's too late. BUT: (do not laugh) I NEED my mother to see this first. She must actually see and hear these men and women, not just their idea, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, perhaps forever. Then she will have the emotional determination to have this movie watched by my brother. Once this film is finished, he can then make look at his son, my youngest nephew, too. Then my nephew could start taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> (((is there another time when it will be broadcast on TV, if so, tell me when?)))) <br /> <br /> However, my problem is, my mother does not have a DVD player, she still uses video (is it accurate with tapes?). So I have to find a way to allow him to watch this movie. Can I buy this from anyone in this form? If not, is there another way for me to get that in the form of a band of anyone? Is there a legitimate link that I can pay to download to my computer and transfer it to a tape. If yes, who would I contact? I will gladly pay the privilege, provided it is a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have alternative ideas, I will consider everything you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Help me, I already lost a precious being, loved and loved, I already know that my oldest nephew will never be the same when he comes back and I risk to to lose too. I can not lose three and the emotional toll for all those who do it is too high to pay for every male child in my family of this generation. Help me please. I will be happy to call you and send me a number by e-mail if this is the best way to get the necessary information. Thank you very much for any help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
