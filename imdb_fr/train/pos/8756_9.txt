I caught this film accidentally on a cable in the middle and I had to rent it to see it in full and I'm glad I did. I was immediately drawn to the screenplay and I worried about the girls involved. The na√Øve high school graduates, best friends since their childhood, go on a school trip to high school and are supported by a crook named Nick, who causes them serious problems. They are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring. In custody, girls learn to cope with their incarceration while trying to find a solution to their problems. Everything they try to help is lacking when the Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and girls end up having more problems and lose the trust of their American lawyer "Yankee Hank". Hank gives up trying to defend them after feeling betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hank's Thai wife feels the rat in the case and continues her investigative work and discovers that the girls have really been victimized. The end of the movie when Alice did a selfless act to save Darlene (Beckinsale) made me cry. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it.
