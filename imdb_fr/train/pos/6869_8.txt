This film may seem dated today, but remember that it was shot in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, at the time George Carlin was overtaking the hippie Dippie Weatherman and sink into satirical humor. This film is the grandfather of all. Enjoy it for its historical significance as well as for its high entertainment value.
