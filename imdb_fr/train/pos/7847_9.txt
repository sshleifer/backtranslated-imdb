Believe it or not, at 12 minutes, this movie (for 1912) is a feature film. Very, very few films were longer than that at the time, but this is certainly not what distinguishes this strange little film from the rest! No, what's different is that all the actors (except a frog) are insects ... yes, insects! This simple little domestic comedy might have looked a lot like productions featuring Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but this Russian production uses rather bugs (or, I think, bug-like models). Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy were still to be discovered and I suppose Linder was busy. Maybe that's why they used insects! Using stop-motion, the bugs moved, danced, and fought incredibly well - and much more realistically than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Mr. Beetle sneaking for a good while. He goes to a bawdy club while his wife is waiting at home. Unfortunately for Mr. Beetle, he is filmed by a film buff from the region. In addition, he does not know, but Ms. Beetle is also continuing her work with a Bohemian grasshopper painter. Of course, this family comedy has much more to offer than the plot, but the plot is old and very entertaining for adults and children alike. <br /> <br /> Weird but also very surprising and observable.
