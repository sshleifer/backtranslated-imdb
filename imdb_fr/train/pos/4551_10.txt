I had never seen such incredible acting in a film as when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis playing Christy Brown in My Left Foot. In fact, his role was not even finished. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled like him throughout the shooting of the film and had to be operated because of the damage caused by his acting acting superior to the back. For me, it's remarkable and despite all the pain he has borne to play this role, I think it is quite true to say that he has achieved the most worthy performance of an Oscar for 'history. He was so masterful in this difficult part that I think no one could have done it better and with more impact than him. Although I can not say that this is the greatest movie of all time, I can say that the way he played this impossible and that he continued playing until he did not play anymore , is without a doubt the biggest foot I know in an actor do. Probably a man too in this respect.
