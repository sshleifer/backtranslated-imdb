Why does it seem that the husband calls him Appy? That ruined a big episode, so I can only give it a 6. Correct grammar and pronunciation are essential to a movie. <br /> <br /> It was very Hellraiser with her skin torn but I do not know how we can survive. without skin, the skin is a vital organ for the body, the largest organ now and without which we would die. The more a horror movie is true, the more it can be scary and more entertaining. <br /> <br /> I admit that the stories of the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 come on the Yankies, put your english up to par!
