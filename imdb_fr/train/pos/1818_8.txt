I saw this film when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it was only when I looked at it again, at 13, that I really understood it. A cartoon on a criminal dog with a real heart of gold "adopts" a little girl to exploit her for her talking skills with animals. The dog star, Charlie B. Barkin, is murdered by his formal business partner, Carface, (which is diabolical). His soul then goes elsewhere than in the heavens to find a gold watch that fits well with his life, and that Charlie, being the sneaky but adorable person he steals and rewinds, sending him back to Earth. Once back on Earth, Charlie seeks revenge for the evil Carface. This is how he meets the young Anne-Marie, the lonely little orphan who can talk to animals that Charlie expects to scam for his talents in order to take revenge on his enemy, Carface. But the scoundrel Charlie comes to take care of the young Anne-Marie and her plans, but he has to decide to do the right thing after Anne-Marie discovers what her "best friend" Charlie really uses to make money. new and better dog casino. He must now save her from the dreaded Carface. I still love this movie even at the age of 22. The idea and the plot are really different and original from those of many other animated films. I particularly like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once. Carface was even better than it was later in All All Dogs to Heaven. In this picture, he seemed quite dubious of his role as villain.
