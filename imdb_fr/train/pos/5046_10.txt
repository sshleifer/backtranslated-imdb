There is such garbage on cable movie channels that I discover a gem with this one. From beginning to end, it had seized me and deserved the best grades. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons hears messages from "God" to kill people who are said to be "demons". <br /> <br /> When the opening credits showed the director as one of the actors, which can often be a warning for a bad movie; exceptionally, it is the opposite because the drama is without stop from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> And there is not a moment in the movie where you are not completely captivated, because there are no subplots, and the script is first class . <br /> <br /> All actors give quite convincing performances, especially the main actor who is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This film is at least as good as the movie "Silence of the Lambs".
