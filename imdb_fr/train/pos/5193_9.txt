The sword fights were out of this world, the spectacular battle scenes without the technique of flying over (to the end) that are far too common today. The scene with Chan and Pray was probably the highlight of the movie. The characters of the assault on the mansion of the wicked were clich√©s, but the film is at ease with that. An injection of humor from Woo. <br /> <br /> The plot with its twists was unpredictable and exciting and you could not tell who was good or bad or which side were the people. <br /> <br /> Good sense of suspense and good surprises. The depth of the story is intense enough for such a fickle movie and comes to you as most kung-fu movies do.
