The magic works in a mysterious way. This film about 4 prisoners trying to escape with spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago, was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and a lot of suspense. Even if there was a play (almost everything happens in the cell), it never got bored and the game was very good. In the tradition of "Cube", you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal, you developed some sympathy for some of them, but you changed your mind by the twists of the story. Some events caught you off guard and there was always a hint of madness in the air. Overall intense and entertaining and as I was not expecting anything (a friend praised it), it was a nice surprise!
