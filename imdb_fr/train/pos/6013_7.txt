After watching this again after many years and remembering the flop he had on his initial release, I'm surprised how well he resisted. One of the reasons for its failure was that a generation simply thought it was indulgent shit and a younger one was disappointed at not showing all of her hippie fame. Now, it is clear that Antonioni was already conscious and fascinated by the intoxicating mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of clear vision for the future. The pair of pellets is excellent and it is shameful that they have taken so many criticisms for the perceived failure of the film. They are ideal and perfectly reflect the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure pleasure of making love. I blame others for the emphasis on student rebellious sequences at first, but I must say that this is one of the director's most beautiful images and he has certainly made the most of the natural landscapes and created by man. Oh, and I did not even mention the highly explosive end.
