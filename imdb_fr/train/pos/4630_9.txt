This is the second Eytan Fox movie I saw. The fantastic actor Lior Ashkenazi, who played in Walk on Water, also plays a minor role in this film. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is some sort of friend / sex thing in the city (mostly gay), and they all want the war to end so they can continue their life in peace. <br /> <br /> But that's all. rub it. No matter how many posters you have placed or how much praise you have for peace, the war is not going to end. Over the years, many have tried to bring both sides to the table, but they just want it to continue for whatever reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both over there and here in the United States, who want just everything and will not consider peace. On the Palestinian side, many are apparently out of work if peace is restored. It is not in anyone's interest to put an end to this war and the children are suffering. <br /> <br /> That's what you always worry about when you watch this fun and engaging movie. It will not go away. You know that something tragic is going to happen and, of course, that happens. The feelings on both sides being strong, and revenge as a motivator, tragedy always happens, and that's what makes this movie an adult version of Friends / Sex in the City. There is no superficiality. This is real life and it was a beautiful thing to see.
