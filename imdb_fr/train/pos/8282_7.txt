** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie that does not work is Wendigo, and when your main character fails, your movie is usually not far behind. The filmmakers' interpretation of the Wendigo's form is interesting and may be threatening when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rearview mirror, for example - and the tree shape was really very good. However, as a monster character, he never comes to life. We do not have much explanation about his behavior, and what we see does not correspond to the story told in the film itself, nor to any other Wendigo story I have ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons the monster fails is that it is not given enough in the movie. When you summarize this film thoroughly, you get a suspense thriller with a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is good, although a bit cheesy; Filmmakers use sets, lighting and the time of day to convey the atmosphere and atmosphere rather well. The character of Otis appears as really dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster of the film. It might have been more effective to explain his behavior because he was possessed by the hungry spirit of the Wendigo, which would also be a more accurate representation of the true legend. <br /> <br /> I heard unconfirmed information (from a focus group) that explains why the Wendigo does not do much is that, when the monster costume was built, it found himself so heavy and uncomfortable (to mimic his standing on split hooves, the artist had to walk on his toes) that it was almost impossible to run, walk or play anything else. Thus, the many lightnings of the creature standing still and the obvious accelerated sequence of it running. I emphasize that these reports are not confirmed.
