It's not really a big hit at the box office, but I was pleasantly surprised <br /> <br /> with this movie. James "I did some things to Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> <br /> co-wrote and directed this film about an ordinary and ordinary guy <br /> <br /> named Larry Burrows who thinks his life would have been incredibly different if he hit a circuit during a key baseball game at <br /> <br /> when he was 15 years old. But thanks to a mysterious and magical bartender <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry realizes his wish and realizes that his new life <br /> <br /> is not exactly what he hoped for. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie really impressed me. Critics have mixed it, and I must say that the concept is really interesting and went well. Yes, it's a bit standard, but there are enough <br /> <br /> fun moments, drama and excellent performers to make it really good. James Belushi (I think) was worthy of an Oscar for his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton and Renee Russo shine in <br /> <br /> their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. <br /> <br /> It's just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have never seen it, I highly recommend you to check <br /> <br />
