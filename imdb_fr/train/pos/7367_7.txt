I am currently studying cinema at the A.S. level "This is not a love song" is a movie we watched. For me, it's a film with a very simple scenario, but a complex story. If you scratch the surface, you'll find a crime movie featuring two men crossing the countryside after committing a murder: "It sounds quite exciting". <br /> <br /> However, you must go further to discover the true feeling of the true kind. As suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, filled with trust, deception and treason. We are not aware of this "love" directly through the film, but events that occur, such as how Heaton deals with Spike, almost shout that love story intact in our faces. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a good example of why British films should not be considered "garbage" simply because they are made on a small budget. <br /> <br /> A good film with a complex story, but it's definitely an acquired taste and may not be appropriate for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
