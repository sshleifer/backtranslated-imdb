A charming romantic comedy. The plot is a little too complicated - I tried to summarize it three times and I can not. In other words, it's worth the trip. The film is funny, beautiful - the plot is totally unrealistic but it works. Everyone in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great - it creates a sweet, romantic feel throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting game is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and benefit every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are doing well, but that's fine. If you're an idiot for good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), catch him. Plus, Downey looks great in his underwear! <br /> <br /> Extra bonuses: the title song performed by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" performed by Cher and Peter Cetera.
