Well, I had seen "They all laughed" when he was released in Europe around 1982 and had a vague but expensive memory of it. I've just seen him on tape almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a real sincere tenderness for his characters and a kind sympathy that is difficult not to feel too. Great actors and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone and pretty good editing too. I laugh and smile all the time. As we all do, sometimes. Go and get it.
