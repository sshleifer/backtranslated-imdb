This series premiered for the first time on the Comedy Central cable television channel in the United States. He was chopped to death and shown out of sequence. It was sad for the public that he should have attracted, it is not the case and has fallen away. Fortunately, at the same time, my cable company went digital and I got the BBC. Thank God I saw "The League of Gentlemen" in order, complete and uncut. <br /> <br /> The "League of Gentlemen" troupe is on display at the "Monty Python flying circus" in England and the Canadian film "Children in the room". But ... a warning. <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentlemen" is however a step further. It's not just about getting dressed and healing the cultural hurts, it's getting deeper and deeper, more and more dark. I can tell many of you now that it will offend some groups of people and enrage others. But remember, his only comedy .. dark, black comedy. If it's not your thing, do not look. If you think you know black comedy, look at this - if you get angry and upset, you do not quite know DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys have understood, and just on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed every character creation. There is a complete story that is told here from episode 1 to the end. You can not watch this episode at once, willy-nilly, this is one of the charms of this series. Look at it in order. See how creative, stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are. Nobody and nothing is out of bounds. That, my dear ones, is "black humor". Bravo!
