A strangely enjoyable effort, combining a much sought after plot including Adam and Burt and flashbacks on the original TV series. Most of the flashback scenes were taken directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I imagine his book was the inspiration for making this film. Like the book, he left fans of the original series in search of others. <br /> <br /> If you missed this show, it's definitely worth borrowing a tape from a friend who may have recorded it. I'm making a copy for my kids right now.
