I really disagree with Guy-yardley-Rees who (if he would have watched the entire movie) could have seen some absolutely awesome Scottish landscapes (some of the best tours ever made in Skye) and found a movie with a difficult start a together really poignant. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. It's more like a movie that has a strong sense of community. <br /> <br /> I can not say how much "standard" movies bother me - repeat the same polite stuff over and over again. Seachd does not seem to be talking about it at all. This seems to really want to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. <br /> <br /> OK, so the acting is not in the style of a blockbuster. This is because the actors are apparently real people. In fact, I thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes exceptionally beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really deserves a second reading, because many subjects become clearer a second time - it really fuels the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, the combination of music and (sometimes) breathtaking images, as well as a community-based approach to theatrical and non-normal structure has turned Seachd into a distinctive memorable film group. More of these please!
