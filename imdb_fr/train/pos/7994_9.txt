I really enjoyed this film. it's night, it's not an action movie on the brain that dodges balls and cars. most of the characters' origins and motivations are rather vague, letting the viewer draw his own conclusions. it's good to see a film where the director lets the viewer make his own idea. <br /> <br /> ultimately, motivated by love or revenge, or by the desire to repent - he does what he feels "right". "Will God ever forgive us for what we have done?" - it is not a question that mortal men can answer - then he does what he thinks he should do, what he is good at, what he was trained for. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a great actor - honestly can not think of a bad movie he did - and he has an excellent cast. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
