It's been so long since I've seen this film (at least 15 years old) and yet it still haunts me with a vivid picture of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war can suffer despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <A unit of Australian underwater demolitions experts is captured in an archipelago near Japan following a successful mine-laying mission to a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as any other prisoner of war. but much to their dismay, a friendly Japanese prison guard quickly learns that they are considered spies because they were in uniform when they were captured. The consequences of such an offense, according to the Japanese martial code, are execution by decapitation. <br /> <br /> Despite their pleas and the pleas of the friendly prison guard, the day of judgment is approaching the time bomb. The tension is so high that you will really hear the ticking, even if it may just be your chest beating wildly with the drums of a running firing squad. <br /> <br /> The end is actually too painful to reproduce in my head much less write it here. But I can promise you, you'll never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the United States
