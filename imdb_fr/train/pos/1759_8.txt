I'm not quite sure that the term "serious comedy" applies to this film, I'm not even sure it can be applied. In recent years, movie theaters have been filled with comedy movies too stupid to make us smile. Therefore, I have considered films that do not fulfill these conditions as "serious comedies". <br /> <br /> Can the Virgin of 40 years be part of this guild? It's finally up to you to decide, but in my opinion, it's a very funny movie. You're kidding a lot, besides, it offers a social comment through characters and really great situations. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty, there's more than a 40-year-old virgin, and even people who do not exactly fit this specification, can feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially by men. <br /> <br /> The story, as the title says, talks about Andy, a shy and quiet guy, who collects figurines, looks at Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia. Kal is Andy's colleague at SmartTech. He believes Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, but yet, he seems to get what he wants with the opposite kind. <br /> <br /> David is the passionate guy who is always in love with his ex-girlfriend, who ran away with another guy. . And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be affected by his ongoing acts of cheating and clashing. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people aged 13 to 21 have watched this movie before, but it's really no age limit to enjoy it. So, in case you have not seen it and you like to laugh, with social comments, go to your video store and rest in these deep and depressing independent movies. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you will really see from the top down.
