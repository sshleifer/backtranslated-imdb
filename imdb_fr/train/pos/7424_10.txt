I was 16 when I first saw the movie, and this movie has always been one of my favorites. Of course, you can not deny Kristofferson's call in the film - WHAT THE MAN ???????????? Sheesh. He still is. This is the bad boy that every woman secretly wants. His game is flawless. He was drunk / drugs only as someone who had really gone through could do it - and he did - in 1976, he finally took the train, so it was really real. <br /> <br /> The music is SUPER and even though, in the years that followed, I thought that Streisand was not a good person for him in the physical sense of beauty, I think it's more of a problem for viewers than for women. We girls are just looking at Kris - and of course, guys are interested in the female interest - my husband can not watch the movie for him - he does not like his appearance. But I made him sit in front of the red Ferrari scene until the end, just so he could see how well it was done - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with explosive music - you should have seen it on my plasma 50 "- WOW !!!! And finally, the quality of the transfer was BIG - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with a great color and a very low noise except for dark areas, which is normal for all movies. <br /> <br /> Bringing good memories of my mother and I loving this movie together, I bought him a copy for Christmas I would have liked watch it with her last night. <br /> <br /> I tried to read the original with Judy Garland, but I guess to see this one first, I just can not get into it Previous era.View all the concert sequences of the '76 version looked so much like what I was living at the time. <br /> <br /> I'm going through Streisand's commentary, but she seems to be talking only about herself and her so far, she barely mentioned Kris or details on scenes from the film. His voice sounds EXACTLY the same thing at the time. <br /> <br /> Look, if you grew up at the same time as me (born in 1960), you will love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
