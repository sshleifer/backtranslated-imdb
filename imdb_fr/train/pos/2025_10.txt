Anne Brontes epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read in the schools, libraries and salons of peoples. It's a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mother struggles to keep her son away from her brutal husband. It's so similar today that we see and hear stories, and I think people can learn a lot from reading this book. Based on true real experiences that the author experienced in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, this is an excellent version of the book and it is very moving. I am sure that Anne herself would have been happy with the way it was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and good locations.
