I just saw this movie tonight, opening night. It was great!! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and it was one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you're reading this ... my sister lives in Austin, where you live ..... and she was supposed to buy you a drink once ... well ... she you got up a little ... but she did not want it !: C) [nobody will believe it ...]) ALWAYS, it's a fantastic movie. Anyone who likes a good sports film should go see it! : C)
