I just used this video and watched it last night. The acting game started extremely badly (hey ------ hey ------ twister) but went very well shortly afterwards. The tornadoes looked extremely wrong, and many CGI effects were very gloomy, but the scene with the house was breaking and the content of the blown and sucked scenes was extremely well done and about the same level as movies like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done. The story was very well written and it's refreshing to watch a film like this move away from the same "disaster type movies" of this kind, and that seems to be stuck for 30 years. <br /> <br /> the film had a very strange mix of special effects and acting quality, which deserves an A in my book.
