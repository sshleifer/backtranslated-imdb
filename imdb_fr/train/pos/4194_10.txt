Samuel Fuller brings his usual playful and stylish direction to this lean and pulpy story and manages to create one of the uncommon jewels of 1950s cinema. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark plays the role of a tough guy a small thief (a role he has perfected over many films), who stole a young woman's wallet (Jean Peters) in a New York subway and with a much sought after piece of microfilm. We are in 1953, of course, the microfilm belongs to the spies of Commie who will stop at nothing to recover it. When the girl arrives at Widmark's waterside hut, sent by an abusive boyfriend to get the movie, Widmark understands the opportunity to shake her and her "fellows" for a lot of money. The plot thickens, people begin to die, and Widmark and Peters fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller treats the love story clumsily, but more out of indifference than by a misinterpreted writing or direction. It's as if he included a love story under duress, and thus made it intentionally unbelievable, as love stories were so often present in Hollywood movies. Peters gives a remarkable performance as a sturdy cookie of New Yawk, half-gangster and damsel in distress. When acts of violence are perpetrated against her, we really care about her well-being, and that's typical of Fuller's renegade style, ahead of her time, that a happy ending is not necessarily inevitable. <br /> <br /> The ultimate success of "Pickup on South Street" rests unequivocally on the exhausting shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a fierce woman who earns money in every possible way, it is selling ties or acting as a police informant. Ritter gives the performance of his career; In a breathtaking monologue, she evokes without ever directly addressing the sad life of her character and the despair she feels every day in a world of struggle, crime and hardship. It's as if all the characters Ritter had ever played converged for a brief moment to give free rein to all the emotions they did not have the chance to release in these other films. The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film and the highlight of the 50s cinema, period. <br /> <br /> Note: A +
