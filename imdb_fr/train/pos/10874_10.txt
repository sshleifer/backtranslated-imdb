<br /> <br /> I have to admit I was expecting something very different from my first "Cut" screening last night, even though I was thrilled with the unexpected Australian horror gem. I'm a horror fan as true as they come, and I found that "Cut" was not only the best of the kind that Australia has ever produced, but that it was one of the great movies of parody / comedy of the last decade. <br /> <br /> My only concern is that the general public can not capture many comic elements - the film was not too smart in its application but made me laugh every turn trying to fit in ALL possible clich√©s of the kind of horror possible. I'm sure this was meant for humor .... hoping it was meant for humor. <br /> <br /> And of course, there was the gore. <br /> <br /> The use of the word "custom" "Garden shears was brilliant - Besides the knocks and cuts expected. In short, there was a great amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this film. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Kylie Minogue (in short, her appearance was) Molly Ringwald was another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as Simon Bossell ("The Castle") in a brilliant role as jokey technician. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think this film is one of the best horror products of recent years, as well as a beautiful satire / parody - a language until the end. <br /> <br /> I loved it. Go see him!
