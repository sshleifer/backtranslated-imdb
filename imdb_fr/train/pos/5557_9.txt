"A mouse in the house" is a very classic drawing of Tom & Jerry, true to their tradition but with his own jokes. It's hysterical, hilarious, fun and fun. The illustrations are of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short film is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he also tries to catch the mouse, because "there will be only one cat in this house in the morning - and it is the cat that catches the mouse". <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are a lot of funny gags in this caricature. Funnily for me, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees both lazy cats asleep and says sarcastically "I'm glad you're taking a nap" and she hopes they're happy because she does not do it . two cats panting. Another funny gag is when Tom disguises himself in Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan, then Butch makes the same turn to Tom. Of course, this is even more fun when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and the two cats (stupid!) Think they are disguised as Mammy and that they are both attacking the back - lol. Naturally, she gets angry and once she gets angry, she is no longer a person to have fun with. But even Jerry does not win this time because he is also being kicked out by her.
