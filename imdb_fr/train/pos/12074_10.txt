Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best film directors. This is surely his best. <br /> <br /> It does not have some of the standard features of what we now call black film. Although American-made, it takes place entirely in England. There are missing gangsters. He misses a femme fatale. There is no shortage of crime. <br /> <br /> The title character responds to an ad. She is thrilled to be able to earn money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up days later as a pawn in a scary plot. Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifying and disturbing ordeal. And Nina Foch gives the feeling of a strong woman like Julia. <br /> <br /> The excitement comes in part from casting against type: Ms. Foch has an elegant style. She is not a screaming, shaking victim. She is in fact a little icy and patrician, though impecunious. This makes the fate of his character all the more credible. <br /> <br /> It is certain that the most fascinating element is the casting of Dame May Witty. She was (and probably is) the most famous for the charming title of "The Lady Vanishes". She has a gentle manner and a harmless, slightly trembling manner. But here she is far from being a heroine. <br /> <br /> George Macready is as excellent as his extremely troubled son. In fact, the cast is superb. <br /> <br /> It seems that this famous and brilliant film was shot almost by accident. Without a doubt, the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a small budget. This is the thrill and charm of the black film, the true film noir: it is small, convincing and unimaginable quality, and in this case, unforgettable.
