Are you a giraffe? ... ask John to Nadia, and she, sure to answer, answers: yes. Begin the communication between a man and a woman who do not know each other, as well as the questions and doubts of "Birthday Girl". A film I've heard many times, but I do not dare to see ... before two o'clock writing this. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is an exciting film that makes me crack, at the same time, this Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses I have ever seen (she is pretty and smart). "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely, mundane man looking for a woman on the Internet. The woman he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be that delicate, normal woman, no more. One day, his birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. Man, begins to discover certain things. From here, he will no longer be the solitary and habitual man who has always been. <br /> <br /> Many of us will think that this movie is just a regular movie with an exploited plot. Many of us will think that action and thrills are safe and not new. But "Birthday Girl" is just the opposite. This film is full of good surprises, good performances and an imaginative scenario that I had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with some funny touch is an excellent natural film with lots of proposals for movies like this. "Birthday Girl" has some scenes of beauty and cruelty, but at the same time, some touching nature and makes it deeper. <br /> <br /> "Birthday Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but in the end, is totally satisfying. And I'm not sorry to say it's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there are any.
