one of the best German low budget movies! Is this the dark side of the new age? if you believe in esotericism, do not watch this film, please! it sweeps away all your positive fantasies. This film shows that beyond the peaceful facade of spiritual research, lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror. I hope there will soon be a 35 mm copy! Andreas Marschall's debut film is just the beginning of a new field, with films worth a few euros! I'm waiting for the second shot!
