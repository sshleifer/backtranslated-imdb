As an amateur historian of the Second World War and Nazi Germany, I could not wait for that to come out on DVD. I missed this in the first edition in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments on historical inaccuracies. We could have done a better job by describing the "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some casting choices, not so much for their acting as for their appearance. Peter Stormare does not look much like Rohm, why did not they make Babson like Hess wore a wig? And my biggest complaint ... we've always talked a lot about Hitler's striking blue eyes. Why did not they bring Carlyle blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler were pretty good. Again, as long as viewers understand that this is supposed to be a 1, story 2 entertainment, I do not think a lot of harm will be done.
