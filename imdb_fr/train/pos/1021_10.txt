The first and second seasons began in a jerky way, with good episodes caught between medium episodes and sometimes clich√© stories. But once he started creating the universe in which he exists and further develop his characters, he became much more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the success of this series is its success thanks to four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's arduous sense of humor makes him look so much better, Peter's staging is excellent and makes any episode even more entertaining, and Joe & Paul never fails to make a funny and interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> Once you have understood the subject of the series and you have come to know the characters, I doubt that the series will not please you. For those who enter the series, I suggest episodes "The Other Side", a good serious episode, and "Window of Opportunity", a classic episode of relief and comedy.
