It's wonderful to see that Shane Meadows already has an international influence - THE CONVOYERS WAITING shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: the class identity wave above average, but well below average , the undisciplined father, the abandoned urban environment, the sense of adult failure, the barely concealed fascism underlying modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is an expert formist, Wedding's exchange of images and surrealistic monochrome mounts to serene composition serve to distance the dark and rather gloomy subject that, like that of Meadows, turns from high prank to the tragedy in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> There are lengths and clich√©s, but Poelvoorde is absolutely crazy, an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions, whose attempts to achieve them are dangerous. while individual adjustment parts - popcorn / pidgeon explosions; the best wedding sequence since DEATH AND DEATH - manage to tear the epiphany out of despair.
