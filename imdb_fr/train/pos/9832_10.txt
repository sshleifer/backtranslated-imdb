Wow, it was a great Italian film "ZOMBIE" by two great directors, Luci Fulci ("ZOMBE") and Bruno Mattie ("THE CHILD OF THE LIVING DEAD"). Lucio started this movie and was sick. surprisingly better than expected, so if you saw Bruno Mattie's "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed by Lucio Fulci and you liked both or one of their themes, then is a movie Look, it has a great makeup "ZOMBIE" that gives a great look "ZOMBIES" has a head "ZOMBIE" fun! And birds "ZOMBIE" that spit you acid and turn you into "ZOMBE" People) but it is especially large "ZOMBIES" toxic as in Bruno Matties "THE HELL OF LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian movies "ZOMBIE" or simply "ZOMBIE" it is usually that this one is excellent Italian film "ZOMBIE"!
