Sarah Silverman's program is very similar to Sarah's. There are so many prejudices that it is impossible to take it to heart. However, the fact is that even though most people will "understand", this does not mean that they will all appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can also just give up there. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because every episode so far has been as good as the last one. <br /> <br /> Like all shows, it's not perfect. Personally, I love the program, but it has huge flaws. Racist songs are funny, but age much faster than Silverman seems to think - a problem I had with "Jesus is Magic" as well. It seems that Silverman has given himself a quota of songs per episode that does not exist. Not to mention that, if the lyrics of the songs she writes are good, the music is not good. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that even if this series will please for some reason, fans of Monty Python, the Vertical Citizens Brigade, etc., this does not look anything like at these shows. I can watch Monty Python all day, but even though I like this show, I can not watch more than half an hour at a time. It becomes flat very quickly. The rehearsal value of this show is also low - the second time around an episode is pretty funny, and the third time, in my opinion, it's boring. <br /> <br /> Yet the first time is very, very funny. Give a shot.
