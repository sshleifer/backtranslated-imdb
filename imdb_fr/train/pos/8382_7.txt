If you like mech war games, that's pretty good. Some are economical, but robot fights are worth the detour. It's been a while since I appreciate the world of the mech war and it's pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that looks like it would drive one of those huge mechs. If you like genres, then the games you like are Mech Warrior Three and Four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to spare Steel Battalion. The film is worth a visit at least once. There really must be more movies on the same theme. Fewer remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
