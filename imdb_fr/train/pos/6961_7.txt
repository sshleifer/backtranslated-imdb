The title caught my eye, then I wondered what was going to happen in the plot, because we've seen so many "super-person" movies in recent years ... and in fact, I really liked that, because there were a number of funny scenes that I did not expect. Uma Thurman played on average in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was able to watch it again on the big screen (like at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, played very well the idiot type of everyday life that meets the big woman, I could really put myself in this situation. If you want to have a little fun, you should definitely watch the adventures of G-Girl and Matt, especially to brighten up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
