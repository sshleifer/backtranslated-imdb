... and the series lets you forget all that. I am about three years older than the children featured in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got my first job after high school graduation in the second shortage of gasoline in 1979. The 70s were been a really terrible time to be young - inflation, minimum competition after school. Salary work with dismissed thirty-year-olds, awful music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of this and still manages to make the 70s fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. He manages to look at the 70s straight into the face - with authentic clothes of the time - while filling the show with the hope of youth and the things that make the high school and college years are both the best and the worst. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers of the series - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have formidable parents with the best intentions in the world. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 1960s finally reached the suburbs in the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who waited until the 1960s to show their whole lives in order to legitimize their strangeness. The friends of Eric, Fez, Kelso and Jackie, complete the group respectively representing nervousness, well-meaning incompetence and snobbery. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show on the suburbs, but he is largely someone who has to play the cards that have been distributed to him even when those cards are distributed by largely absent and careless parents. I strongly recommend the eight seasons, although season eight is a bit late because of Eric's absence.
