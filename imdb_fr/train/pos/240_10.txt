Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and all information should not be considered as factual information. The actual Hollywood conventions used, such as playing A and VERY attractive actors as "heroes", such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right arm), and unattractive actors (sorry Geoffrey Rush) play the drunken and corrupt Victorian police force. This also instills a very unreliable love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) in order to attract all romantics, females being particularly susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned saved the drunken youth from drowning and his father called him "sun," he had a "gleam in his eyes as he looked at me, his hand on my shoulder," it's very romantic and persuading. viewers next to Ned Kelly, the underdog. In addition, do not all Australians like outsiders?
