The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with Pecker, innocent and innocent (played attractively by Edward Furlong), who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Matt, Pecker's friend ("he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), Pecker's sister, Chrissy (sugar addict) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room. <br /> <br /> The film gently shows that everyday life has a lot to offer, and manages to get this message across without saying much. There is always a risk, in passing messages about the value and dignity of "ordinary people", to slip into a kind of "more holistic than you" backdrop - but "Pecker" avoids these pitfalls, allowing the audience to understand the point while allowing enough leeway so that viewers can compare this message to their own reflections on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the film mainly because it is very fun.
