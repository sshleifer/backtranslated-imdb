Alongside the South Pacific, Guys and Dolls is geared toward adults - it's sassy, ​​sexy and packed with men and women who slip on. <br /> <br /> There is an energy and motivation that makes you stand out - the strength of Jean Simmond's performance, the charm of a young Brando and an already masterful Sinatra add a lot to general appearance and appearance of the room. <br /> <br /> A victory of the guys and dolls as it is without a doubt what it is: a musical MGM. <br /> <br /> Always as pleasant to watch and listen to with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and will be watched with pleasure for years to come. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
