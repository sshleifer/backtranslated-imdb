Robert Culp (we call his character "doctor" ... I think he's a veterinarian or something like that) and his family moves to a wealthy, low-tax, law-abiding suburb. Tongue jaws and his dog were nearly killed when idiotic neighborhood kids get drunk and "go cruising" in his garden at 60 km / h. He complains, which causes the anger of the children. Suddenly, he and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing joke campaign. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Manson, um, Marlyn Mason instead, plays her frantic, boiled business woman, who urges her not to use violence against her nemesis mockers and who really wants to just move somewhere with decent public services. But The System is nowhere to be found in Culp, and he does not intend to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what movie people do when the system fails ... (but this is based on a true story, which makes it even better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that even if the naughty hooligans do We have a 70s funk-o-matic "teenage" theme music that warns us when nothing is of use, this film ends up treating age groups impartially (really!). That does not make it a big generation. Congratulations for that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like dogs (or at least, you believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you love justice, and you like fire, and that you like justice for dogs by fire, and you think that people who slide nervously out of troubled communities are "too crazy", then the philosophy of this film is for you. No, it's not really "good", at least not in any widely accepted sense of the word. There is nothing subtle, understated or clever about it, it's just a sort of general interest message for vigilance. However, it captures the feeling of some memorable scenes in other beloved works. Do you remember Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns when Batman drives Mutants on horseback to win back Gotham City? Do you remember that scene in A Christmas Story where the kid stabs the face of the bully? Do you remember how cool it was? Or do you really hate to be looked at funny by your neighbors? Yeah, man. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was a 1973 movie specially made for television that I had just caught at 4 am on my local WB affiliate, and it's probably not meant for the release on DVD. But after being inspired by this movie, do you think I'll sit and take it!?!
