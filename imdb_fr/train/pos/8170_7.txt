As if most people did not already have a nervous vision of the field of dentistry, this little film will make you angry. A successful dental hygienist sees his wife get off the pool driver (the birthday of his birth!) And rushes into a tantrum. After shooting down the head of an attacking dog, he goes into work and ends up taking his spousal assault on the patients as he considers what to do with his wife "slut". There are many close-up shots of the beauty queen's tongue shots, caresses and caresses, as well as a wonderfully disturbing performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he ties and gauzes his wife before shooting his teeth is definitely hard to watch. A dentist is absolutely the wrong type of person to go to the back of the throat and this film explains this in detail. "The Dentist" is incredibly entertaining, fast and ridiculously gore at a time. Check it out!
