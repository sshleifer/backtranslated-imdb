I am black American and I loved this soap opera. I watched it double in Spanish on Telemundo, almost 5 to 7 years ago. The story was a REAL story about a black slave who had a love affair with a white commander leading her to her leadership and a candid and whimsical way of life. <br /> <br /> Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. Many would say that she sold herself - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children. <br /> <br /> It was such an excellent soap-opera that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it's not published. This soap opera was the best soap opera ever. We need it to be published on DVD or broadcast on television. He currently plays on Azteca America, which is only available in Mexico or the United States via pay cable. We need it to be communicated again to Telemundo.
