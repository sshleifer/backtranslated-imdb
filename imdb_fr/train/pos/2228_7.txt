The main problem I see in this movie is its score, which screams at each note, "It's a cheap movie." There is not much more to say here. The score is simply zero. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I consider quite severe, also concerns the unfolding of the plot towards the end of the film (one of the silver plans, if you will be the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau ) and the Sunflower Man (Richard Ziman), in which Martha proves to be the leader of the experience.At any time during this dialogue, the viewer knows very well that he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words, the suspension of disbelief stops here.The integrity of a credible dialogue between two people is sacrificed in favor of a wealth of information that filmmakers want to communicate to the public. > <br /> The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau, although I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress in her work, I think this part may have been too exaggerated. his performance that seemed not to be confused was the spectrum in which the character evolves in the film, from a loving mother of a troubled family to a woman with a mission much like Rambo. This aspect of the scenario would obviously have been exaggerated for any actress and so we can not blame Barbeau too much. To the extent that she played her part with enough skill, I would not call it a serious enough problem for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film did a great job in the first half of the building. a creep factor, especially during his horror flakes. I think the film would have benefited from a stronger commitment to these flashes as a mechanism to avoid a compression of the creep factor in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> So, what is my holistic evaluation of this piece? I would give B- a solid C +, depending on the credit you tend to give to producers for producing this film on a limited budget. Even with two serious problems and two moderately serious problems, the film is based on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I do not see any problem of development or coherence of intrigues; the dialogue, with the exception noted above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the very important key scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the film; As mentioned before, the creep factor was well designed, although a little surprising in the second period; and Nicholas Brendan, who also produced, delivered a magnificent performance. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is definitely worth the detour - see it with a Nazi you love. :)
