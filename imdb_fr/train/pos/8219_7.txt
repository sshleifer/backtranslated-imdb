The Dirty Harry series began with a very serious cop action, and was almost immediately lightened for "Magnum Force". By the time "The Enforcer" rolled, Dirty Harry was little more than a police show on television (recorded only by Tyne Daly). After a seven-year hiatus, Dirty Harry has finally returned to his roots. Maybe he's gone too long this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes the first film about Harry well shot since the creation of Don Siegel, which helps considerably. Harry is a darker character yet again, not the kind policeman he had become. He can once again say things like "Go ahead, do my day" and really think so. "Sudden Impact" is a real sequel to Dirty Harry. "The Enforcer" should never have been made. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
