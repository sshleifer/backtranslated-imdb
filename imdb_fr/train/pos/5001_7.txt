Aardman is still doing it. Next to Pixar, Aardman Animation proves again and again how to do animation properly. <br /> <br /> I had a good time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it was good for the American public. My only concern is that most viewers will not have the subtle humor of this show. <br /> <br /> After being a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I knew what I had to do. when I sat down to watch that. The facilitators did an excellent job of combining pre-recorded voices with a perfectly matched animal. Watch the first episode with the goat, which sounds stoned, and the street dogs who call themselves ceaselessly "dawg". <br /> <br /> It's for everyone? Not far away. In fact, I would be happy to see the show last a season. But as I said before, the public will not get it.
