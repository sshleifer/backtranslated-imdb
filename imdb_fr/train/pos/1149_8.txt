A quick and funny satire on this original "reality TV", the soap opera. The scenario of playwright Robert Harling is filled with lining and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live show that is rapidly deteriorating into bad improvisation and a brain transplant. The murder of his lines by Keven Kline, due to the fact that he does not wear his glasses, is hilarious. "His brain will explore laterally in the next houses." The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It's a treat to see a casting click like in this movie. It is a classic that has somehow slipped between the cracks. <br /> <br /> P.S. Alan Silvestri's score is an added bonus. It is suitable for the soap opera with its flamboyant and melodramatic air.
