It is a beautiful film, rich and very well executed with a rich and meaningful history. Basically, he tells how an old storyteller has to find an (male) heir to continue his job, but ends up not getting what he expected in his world dominated by men. The characters must then manage their situation and the old master must face the conflict between his desire of companion and heir and his traditional notions and those of society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. The exploration of the characters, their lives and their emotions is rich and convincing. The character development is intense, while the characters are complex and not at all dimensional. The film expertly translates the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and shows convincingly how he and the kid handle the situation. There is also humor, sometimes quite subtle, at appropriate moments. The film also examines the pros and cons of traditional Chinese culture, creating additional interest and depth for the film. <br /> <br /> The staging, the acting and the sets are all exceptional. In addition to other strengths, it creates rich and convincing visual images and real and compelling characters. As a result, the film evokes a strong empathy for the characters and feelings for them. <br /> <br /> Some have said that the end weakens the film, but I do not necessarily agree. It might have been stronger with a different end, but any improvement in the whole movie would have been rather minimal.
