Most people (36) have rated this movie as a 10, and those who do not do so are too critical or may be expecting something else. It's one of my favorite movies from the 80's, it's pushing you and everything. I just had it on DVD and 20 years later, it still does not disappoint, with much action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to that great car chases, shootings with automatic weapons and a lot of things that explode and you get a fun and unique experience of your seat! You can even hum or whistle the main theme for days after seeing it. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and you will like it a lot. The premise is that of a paperback hero, like Doc. Savage, actually existing and helping people fight evil so that he can write the story is almost true to reality here. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also director, producer and screenwriter of many films. In this film, Jake Speed ​​(the character) is a type of Indiana Jones adventurer. He usually uses his head to get out of difficult situations, but sometimes uses brutal firepower (yeah, and pure luck, too!). Keep an eye on its high-tech equipment "James Bond", the supreme SUV that falls from the sky. <br /> <br /> The heroine is the very beautiful love of the young vampire of the beginning Jim Carey the film "Once Bitten" and here it is a little older and still as impressive compared to his little blonde teenage sister. <br /> <br /> The wicked are "real bad guys" and are the worst villains evil skeins I love to hate. The end is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, unfortunately never done - but you can imagine what would happen next! <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie just because it will entertain and entertain you and it's worth the price of a ticket.
