Bela made 9 images for Monogram, but it was only CELA, the 4th, that things started to take shape. All the rest of the series will use this one as an essential model for the production, writing and development of the character. From now on, better or worse, the series would also deal with an essential theme: a scientist (usually Bela) doing experiments in the basement or in the old house (sometimes at the basement of the old house) that make things go wrong. It was also the first time that Artistic Director Dave Milton had the chance to spread his wings. He came on board for BLACK DRAGONS, the previous film, but THIS is where he manages to make his art decline. Lewis created a great atmosphere for almost nothing and was present for the rest of the monograms. Casting is the key, and it's a very good movie in B here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also of BLACK DRAGONS), as well as Russell, who would play in the movies CAT PEOPLE of Lewtons..and Rosetto, of SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice part of the talent of Poverty Row. If your time and budget are limited, start with this one ... it summarizes everything they've learned so far and gives you something to compare with the rest. The parcel? Bela steals some gland juice so that her ugly wife stays young. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you can read that and smile, the rest will be easy.
