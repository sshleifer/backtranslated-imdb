Not having seen the two previous ones in the Bourne film trilogy, I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> It was a very exciting experience and I did not have the problem of not understanding what was happening because of not seeing the first two films. Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum even before it reached the gap! I do not think I have ever seen such an exquisite and captivating film, especially an action movie. As I'm generally worried about action movies and thrillers, it was great news for me. The Ultimatum is one of the most captivating films. It catches your attention from the first second to the last minute before the credits. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was just as fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now this fabulous actor has one more thing to add to his list. I am looking forward to seeing more of his films in the future. <br /> <br /> The waterfalls were handled with style - each of them was done brilliantly and I was just shocked by the impressive film. Good game.
