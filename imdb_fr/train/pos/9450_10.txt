As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS, and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman delivers an effective film on the violent side of Man in DELIVERANCE, which is unquestionably a definitive horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox describe four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip on the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before being immersed in what Reynolds calls " a big dead lake. <br /> <br /> But the local mountaineers have a painfully obvious dark vision of these "city boys" parading in their woods. And the next day, continuing down the river, Beatty and Voight are approached and sexually assaulted (the famous "SQUEAL!" Film sequence) by two vicious mountaineers (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). Thus, what began as a lark across the Appalachians has now become a nightmare in which our four protagonists discover the thin line that separates what we consider civilization from what we consider barbarism. /> <br /> James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his bestseller. The result is a shocker often striking and disturbing. Often known for his "SQUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjos," DELIVERANCE is also a hard-fought ordeal, with the top four men in their roles, and McKinney and Coward are two of the scariest villains of all time. A film to see absolutely for those who want to try their luck.
