A lot of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his pace. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen most of the films or at least other films by the same director mentioned in this document, you will be a little lost. <br /> <br /> And the list of films is long. Director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Dizziness, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola). <br /> <br /> There are segway movies like Star Wars: Episode III, Matrix ... but I guess they are baits. Granted, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or if it bothers you) psychoanalysis, then you will not be bored. <br /> <br /> But you should not be, as a set, clips, as the film intertwines with these clips, Zizek's arguments are never boring.
