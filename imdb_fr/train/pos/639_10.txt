It's a good family show with a large cast of actors. It's a nice break from the reality TV blitz of the end. There is nothing else like television at the moment, unless you consider Joan of Arcadia as similar, because she also has a teenage main character. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth a look, because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of sympathy and naivety that seduces without being too soft and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the rest of the main cast, and each plays a leading role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister, Betsy; It's a pill, but she always cares about her mother and brother, even if she does not like to show it. It may take a few episodes to really find his legs, but Clubhouse is without a doubt one of the best shows to come in a long time, so take a look, you'll be happy to have done!
