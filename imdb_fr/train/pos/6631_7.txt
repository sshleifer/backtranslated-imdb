I do not know at all how to describe this film, and I would also like to offer others the same opportunity that I had - to see him without knowing what to expect. I really appreciated this experience, but I can also say that I hardly understood what was happening, if in fact there was something to understand. David Lynch fans (tangentially) or especially those of Guy Maddin should particularly appreciate this, and all fans of the EIGHTBALL comics will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder (it's as close as any movie that I saw the mood that Dan Clowes creates so effectively). <br /> <br /> Just a quick note to warn anyone who is easily offended - this movie, if it is filed, would be NC-17 for sure. Fans of frontal male nudity, however ... hmm, well ... yes. It's a strange wild thing.
