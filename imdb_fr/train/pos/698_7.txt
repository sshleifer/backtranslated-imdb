I saw this film some time ago, after having ordered it for my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The film itself was very interesting, although it had its positives, which for me was the kind of "wtf?" From Donnie Darko. factor after the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the positives are also negative points. For me, the girl in the movie was incredibly good and Dominic Monaghan also did a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have that opinion of Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. It may just be me, and I do not pretend to be a serious critic, because I do not find myself clever enough, but he did not seem convincing as an actor. But it may be even more striking, because although I'm not critical, it catches my attention. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think it's really interesting to watch a movie. It's interesting, confusing, and you should just have seen it.
