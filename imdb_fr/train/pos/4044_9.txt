I found this film very rhythmic. The premise is quite imaginative and, as a spectator, I was trained as the characters developed. The rhythm is very well done for those who like to think - enough things are hidden from the viewer from the beginning, and questions continue to arise which are answered later, producing a well thought out and very satisfying film, both cerebral and 'an action. point of view. <br /> <br /> It seems that some people were looking for a non-stop roller coaster ride with this movie - one of those coming out of the portal. It would be more like one of those mountains that, in the first place, slowly climbs the hill - creating a wonderful feeling of anticipation - and which, in the end, seems to me more fulfilling for the foundation initially laid. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie.
