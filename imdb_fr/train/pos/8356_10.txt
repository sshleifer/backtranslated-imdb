Not sure whether this counts as a spoiler or not, so beware: <br /> <br /> Just a small but essential thing to watch out for, an intriguing possibility: the boys steal a green CitroÃ«n at some point, for a ride in joy, and return it to the owner after inflicting deliberate concealed damage to the car, in the hope that the owner will collapse. Is it the same car they fly much later from the family on a picnic? We know that the original owner sold it. In the end, they leave on a dangerous road, a road that, to my knowledge, has been closed to all but pedestrians for ten years. A whole new orientation towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film could have been called "Scent of a Woman". I do not remember another film, certainly not American, which treats the perfume of a woman in such a frank and open manner, a little like the "nose" of a beautiful Bordeaux.
