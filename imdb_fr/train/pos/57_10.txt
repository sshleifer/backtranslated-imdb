I must say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I was bored and looking through the TV and found "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 min., But I got hooked. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in anyone's life. I give him a 10, more if possible. The director / scriptwriter and the actors did an incredible job. I think teens should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / screenwriter should write more movies like this one. I liked it! I did not even know this movie, which is sad because it was so good. I wish he could go to movies for more people to see.
