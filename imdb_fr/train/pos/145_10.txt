The sequel to "The Kingdom" is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and could not sit for 5 1/2 hours) but loved what I saw. Ghosts, blood, murders, poisonings, mutated babies, voodoo ... everything is there! If you have a strong belly and you like strange movies, this is for you. <br /> <br /> In addition, you do not have to see part 1 to understand that ... you'll understand! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdoms 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Watching these marathon movies in a theater is tiring. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there will probably be no "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after his shooting. But you never know!
