A very good movie. A classic sci-fi movie with humor, action and everything. This film offers a greater number of extraterrestrials. We see the leaders of the rebel alliance and a large part of the imperial forces. The Emperor is, in a way, an original person. I liked the Ewoks representing in one way or another the native savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke, who is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy is finished and the Empire ends up falling. I also enjoyed the celebration of victory where she filled Vader's redemption and returned Anakin Skywalker's spirit with Yoda and Obi-Wan. This gives a sadness and a tear. The biggest scenes of Star Wars are among this film: When Vader turns on the emperor. Luke looks and finds solace when he sees Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version no Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is where Luke rushes to attack Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this movie despite a good ending. I felt that there was much more than what we see. And as always, John William's music will bring classicism to the Star Wars universe.
