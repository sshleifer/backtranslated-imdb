I was raised in Doc Savage, and I was terrified of death in childhood, but I still found it entertaining. I made many friends and colleagues watching this movie and I was very amused by the diversity of the reactions, certainly, they think especially that I am strange, but that's it. "I do not know about doc, but he still has girls" must be the ultimate line when looking at his group of sad men. This film is a classic parody of the whole kind of superhero, and was long before it was time, so do not take it seriously, but rather pass over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a god. It is unfortunate that this movie was not released on DVD in the UK. I do not think it should be redone and bastardized, as I said it's a classic, it can not be done without Ron (like Italian work without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
