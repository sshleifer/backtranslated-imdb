This film is incredibly beautiful. Goldsworthy's art really benefits the medium of the film because you can see art in its best light, moving, changing and fulfilling. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I can not think of anything else to say about it. It's just the kind of film you MUST see, because it's so visually captivating and really refreshed me when I came out of the movie theater.
