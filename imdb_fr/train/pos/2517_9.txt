I had this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I had anticipated it a lot when it arrived. My worst fears were that it was a painful walk, as well as ... well, you know what all the screaming fan girls were talking about? GACKTnHYDE = love hawt yaoi? That sort of thing? By dreading it. I was very very pleasantly surprised. The film was amazingly viewable, though the filming and the music gave the impression that someone was going to break a pair of nun-chucks every other scene, and Gackt's role was pretty good. Hyde, being, uh, Hyde, was acting as a quasi-romantic friend / gang member who would not have seen him on stage. He is one of my two main oxen with the film itself. But the rest of the cast (including the children in the opening scene) was very good at doing what he did, that is, being shot at and shouting after. But my second problem was very minor, related to goriness. That seemed to me far too horrible - as in all scenes where someone is shot, either they collapse, or in a very sincere death, or they lie a long time. But Sho just ... takes the shots, repeatedly, looks at himself, boils MUCH while he's talking and makes Hyde cry. All in all, if you're a fan of one of the actors or just a fan of j-movie, it's definitely worth watching.
