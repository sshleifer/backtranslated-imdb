Red Rock West is a perfect example of the quality of a movie with virtually no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and a lot of atmosphere. RRW provides all this and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays a wounded ex-navy in Lebanon, who lost $ 5 after being denied work on an oilfield because of his bad knee. He plays a role in Red Rock and is confused by bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not quite his most threatening but still perverse) with a Texas hit-man. He pays him to kill his wife and make him look like a burglary. Only when he gets there, just to watch. She offers him the double to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get hell out of the city with his free money and let the lovers sparring be. But a series of mishaps and setbacks lead him to come and go from Red Rock in both directions. This eventually leads to a confrontation with Lyle from Dallas (cheeky and likeable Dennis Hopper), the real Texas hit-guy who offers his help without knowing that it further complicates the plot. <br /> <br /> RRW never had an important release, which is why most of his audience discovered it on video or television shows. Seeing it that way can make it look like a TV movie, but it's bigger than that. The tricky and slow direction, the dark score and the desert wind would have made this movie a great movie, but the best you can do these days is to watch the DVD in a big HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring femme fatale with her dirty dyke-ish hairstyle. I certainly would not fall for her, but if you assume that Nic Cage's character is related to militant lesbians, you'll accept it anyway.
