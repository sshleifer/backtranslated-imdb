Any movie showing that federal PIGs (people in government) are real-power threats in real life strongly recommend it to me. <br /> <br /> Alas, the supervision and editing of the script, and even, Sometimes the staging is imperfect, so there will be people who denigrate the entire film and ignore the good times. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way when it was new and I hated it, despised it, hated it. I thought it was a terrible piece of junk and irrational. <br /> <br /> Now, I do not remember why. <br /> <br /> I think the two should not be compared or even connected. <br /> <br /> Think of them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> Write them down as two different movies. <br /> <br /> This "vanishing point" is a gathering place, a banner for those who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize that the government of freedom can be threatened by freedom, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "The Voice" wears a cap that carries the motto of the state of New Hampshire: "Live free or die." At one point, it was the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a film to applaud.
