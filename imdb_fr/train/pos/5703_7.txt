I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner and this movie explores some of these themes of highway death and 80s film noir that I like to see, so I enjoyed them. <br /> <br /> In general, most of the stupidity of the protagonist film noir is not well drawn by the female lead and her hero is almost a Neanderthal, hence the kitch warning.
