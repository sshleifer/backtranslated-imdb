'Capital City' fans rejoice! This first season of this series is now available on Network DVD and I recently received my copy! Although CAPITAL CITY, a key figure in the trading room, presents a variety of moments throughout its first and second seasons in which each member of the team plays an important role in a central or peripheral plot. The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of the main trader's staff group Wendy Foley (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms, interests and personalities, which helps to make the for most people, seemingly sterile subject of financial negotiation reasonably engaging through the engaging performance of the distribution. In fact, this seemingly dynamic young team is in direct contrast to Shane Longman's rather timid and outdated senior management, represented by Lee Wolf (Richard The Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I think such an unconventional way of working, as used by Wendy's team, would not have come true if Peter Longman, a young "free spirit" and young, had not inherited his thirty a hundred shares of the company and allowed his father to be more fashionable. , relaxed modern work mode becomes a reality. To a certain extent, immediate supervisor, Leonard Ansen (John Bowe), of Wendy's, follows the establishment in the traditional way of running the company, though his dedication to Wendy sees him instead occupying the "middle ground" most of time. I believe that the main interest of this series stems from the romantic attraction between Douglas Hodge's Declan and the fair-haired and confident German merchant, Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell), who encouraged viewers to wonder stop if the situation between these two colleagues develops beyond the friendship / inclination they undoubtedly have. <br /> <br /> We look forward to this title, and hope that the second season of thirteen years will not be so far!
