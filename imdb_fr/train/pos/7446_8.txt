I do not agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw the film on a British television channel, it was presented as an independent film, and if you take the film from that angle, I think it's a completely different question. I could not believe what I saw and became addicted instantly. The plot may be as bad as a JS show (that is, there is no plot), but the acting is bad, it's hilarious and it's is an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> It says as much about America as a Bully or Ken Park without a dramatic perspective, but it gives a glimpse of the American society and more specifically of what the viewers of the post- American noon (and I think there are many!) are interested. After all, it's the neighbors we're talking about, is not it? <br /> <br /> 100% pleasure!
