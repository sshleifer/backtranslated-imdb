I saw this film twice during community screenings and I really liked it. I work in the Jane Finch community and I think the film really captured the essence and flavor of the community: courage, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your face with a dose of desperation. The writing, the dialogue and the acting are strong and I really found myself in the story of the young woman Raya as she struggled to achieve her goals and not get lost in the process. Beautiful dance sequences and it's not just the bodies that move gently and with electricity, but the camera also moves with a lot of fluidity and intelligence. All characters are multi-dimensional - none are totally good or bad and the female characters are beautifully strong. It's a heart-pounding film that celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like Jane Finch.
