"Shall We Dance?", A light film in Japan, about an accountant and an overworked family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he sees on the train during his daily travels. What he finds in the studio are dance lessons and, most importantly, himself. Funny, poignant and utterly charming, "SWD" is an award-winning film that deserves to be watched by more mature viewers.
