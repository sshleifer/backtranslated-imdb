Sylvester Stallone's choice to play Renny Harlin's protagonist is commendable, because Stallone is that kind of tough, shredded person who previously conferred on Rocky Balbao's characters and Rambo will have the boldly versatile character required. But comparing the Die Hard series to Cliffhanger is a far-fetched idea. <br /> <br /> The very well-designed opening scene presents the audience with the thrill, suspense and intrigue that will engulf them in the bloody and perilous episodes of encountering the outlaws. Burglary and high-altitude transfer of cash in suitcases from one aircraft to another have not been filmed before. <br /> <br /> The biting cold of the snow-covered Alps and the deception and treachery of the antagonist forces make you shudder with terror. The forces of the brilliant adventure and ruthless killings go to the end of the drama. <br /> <br /> Good movies are not made every year and people do not have a treat to watch from time to time. Aside from the filthy language / language that engenders a cheeky excitement during certain scenes, the film can be considered a film that will not fade away from its captivating appeal even after watching it for so many years.
