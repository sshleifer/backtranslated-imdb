I would not say it's a bad movie. In fact, it is quite typical of the type of film that the studios "of the rank of poverty" came out at the time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in her role as a somewhat insane doctor-scientist, posing as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and her henchmen have the ugly habit of stealing brides and, after their deaths, inject Bela's wife with a serum taken from their bodies to keep her young. Lugosi is more than ready to make this film a pleasant film. However, the movie suffers from the ultra-bois game of stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror movie) is particularly bad in this case. I have seen it in many movies and TV shows and it is still the same. stiff, wooden and absolutely not convincing. Miss Walters is only slightly better, but she also lacks acting talent to make her role credible. However, the viewer can appreciate Lugosi's great show, yet another despicable stratagem that will ultimately be foiled! Despite the poor role of some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a movie to see.
