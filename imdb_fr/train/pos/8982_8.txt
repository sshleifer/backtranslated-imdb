Damn, was that a lot to take into account? I was pretty fascinated from the beginning. It was quite perfect, although I would say that editing has a lot to do with that. I can not believe this guy was on good terms with them (especially Anton) to get all these images without any serious ... beef. The Dandy came together, middle-class children who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which many people may not have felt. Excellent film and large selection of topics. I recommend it to all music / movie fans. You will probably learn something about making a movie.
