If you like "Othello", you will love this movie, because half of the film revolves around the theatrical production of the play. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters in the role of Colman's Life while Edmond O'Brien plays the role of enterprising newsagent. <br /> <br /> Two of the support players I particularly liked were Millard Mitchell, the graying journalist who finds an angle, and Joe Sawyer, the 1940s response to Drew. Carey, who plays the cop on the box. <br /> <br /> Great moments raw in this one with a black realism.
