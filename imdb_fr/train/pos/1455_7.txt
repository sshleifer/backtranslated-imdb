Mardi Gras: Made in china is an excellent film that shows how much two cultures have in common but are not even aware of the influence of each society on each other. David Redmon opens his eyes and lets you see how the workers in China make pearls that cost nothing and are sold in America for up to $ 20. When Redmon questioned the Americans about the origin of these pearls, they had no idea and seemed stupid. When he told them that they were made in China for nothing with horrible wages and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans seemed sad, hurt and a little remorseful but did not really seem to stop buying them. pearls after discovering the truth. . When Redmon questioned the workers in China, they did not know that the Americans wore them around their necks and paid a lot for these pearls. The workers laughed at the goal behind the beads and could not believe it. This film is an excellent film that gives us food for thought in other countries than ours. <br /> <br /> Mr. Pitts
