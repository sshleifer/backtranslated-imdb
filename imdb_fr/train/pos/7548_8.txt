Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild trip to watch. One day, I was looking for my On-demand list through the animated section and I found it and decided to watch it. I spent all my time sitting with my jaw open. All this time, I was empty of thoughts or fleetingly shouting "TURN IT OFF !!!". But I have not got. And in fact, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is beautiful. Very artistic, strange and dark. Personally, I loved this movie for breathtaking animation, but the seemingly empty story behind it is just as compelling for me. <br /> <br /> A young boy - finally, a cat - leaves in search of the soul of his sister. In the first part, she is lying sick in her bed and is soon paid by a visit of a kind of mower. His soul is divided in two. One is recovered by the cat boy while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie is slightly lost to me, honestly. I hope they go home and their world is ... maybe slowly collapsing? Perhaps its lack of soul is the solution behind all this, because the rest of the film contains various stages in which the whole world is immersed. First, there is a giant flood, then it gets lost in a dark desert, then everything freezes (thanks to What is God or fate, as you'll see?) Then I think they find the soul of the sister in the form of an orange flower.After that, the whole world disappears.Haha, I absolutely did not understand, but it gives me shivers every time. <br /> < Despite the seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message behind if you look at it enough and you do some research.I personally love things like that, and I'd like to spend some time just for the sake of understanding it, but for some people it's probably not their cup of tea, which bothers you a lot, so if you like cartoons, it's not a movie for you. With an open mind, I highly recommend this film.
