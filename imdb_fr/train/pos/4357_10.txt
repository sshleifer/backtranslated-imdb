I saw the movie at the Nashville Festival. It was magnificent, from cinematography to actor. This is the story of a father and his son and how they appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that never sounds wrong, the film features the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this exceptional cast. The film begins with the aging father (Peter Falk) who tries to understand why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left him. The father introduces himself without warning to the door of his son and daughter-in-law. The next day, the father and son take off to visit a property and undertake a classic car trip. They fish, play billiards, watch a baseball game, get drunk, fight in a bar and dance with strange women. But more importantly, they all face non-verbal tensions that can affect all families. This is the kind of film that touches the heart and makes those closest to them appreciate.
