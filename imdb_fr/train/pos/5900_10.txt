I'm really sorry that this charming and whimsical film (which I saw for the first time shortly after its release in the early 50s) has had such a poor reception more recently. In my opinion, it has been largely underestimated - but it may be more of a European sense of humor than (for example) the American: perhaps in Europe we will be able to better understand and appreciate its subtleties and its situations because we are closer to some of them in real life! Special mention must be made of the limited but good music - especially the catchy and memorable song "It's a beautiful night", which was published separately on a 78-turn HMV record (10-inch label, I think!) In the fifties. I urge those interested to try if you have the opportunity: you may have a good surprise.
