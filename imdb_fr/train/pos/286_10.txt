I read many movies when he was in theaters and they were all bad ... I think you have to be some type of person to enjoy these movies. If you're not a person who loved Walton or the little house ... you will not understand or appreciate these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now about Loves Abiding Joy ... I knew it was bad news the beginning of the movie .... I wish he had shown more end instead of letting you think. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff .... it's 6 years later, so you know he'll be interested in girls. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I have enjoyed all 4 movies so far. ... was not crazy books ... can not wait for the next movie. The way Clark talks to you will be every time. I'd love to see January Jones make an appearance ... maybe a family reunion or something.
