How many of us want to be able to get rid of their social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I guess. Shall we dance? is not a film about dance. It's about getting to know each other, to recognize what you're looking for in life and to have the courage to go looking for it. Mr. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is considered inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day, Mr. Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out the window of a dancing acadamie. he is fascinated by her and eventually enrolls in dance classes. He is ashamed of his dance and ridicule. He conceals the fact that he attends dance classes for his colleagues and his family. <br /> <br /> There is a hilarious scene in the men's room of the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a work colleague who is also dancing, are interrupted in the process of not dancing. There are many other fun and warm scenes. <br /> <br /> The end is not a fairy tale, but the viewer feels good. <br /> <br /> This film helped me understand the Japanese people a little better. It is a warm film and very interesting to see.
