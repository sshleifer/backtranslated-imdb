Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic book lovers because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of being a comic book with bad guys who have a serious looking disorder and who are fun. Warren Beatty directs and plays the role of the main character who fights crime without even using super powers. Dick Tracy has pleased me since I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. It's the perfect movie to watch with his kids. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson of Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with enthusiasm. Madonna as the baby who is the second villain of this movie does not play the same boy toy that she represents. As I said, no blood, obscenities, sexual insinuations or anything that offends anyone.
