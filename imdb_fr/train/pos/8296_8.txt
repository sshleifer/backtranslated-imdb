Everything is idyllic in the suburbs when the family settles down, the father having found a new job in a computer company. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local country club without the husband, who certainly holds secrets. The father is not a carpenter, but the pressure is strong for him to join, because all the members of the neighborhood and work are members. The good side of Robert Urich is a little warm, but Joanna Cassidy, a benevolent housewife, turns sour. A cool and suspenseful cooler with Susan Lucci, the bitch as club president. Look for the favorite cult Michael Berryman in a valet role. The film captures the meaning of paranoia and waits for the end of special effects. I saw this movie several times.
