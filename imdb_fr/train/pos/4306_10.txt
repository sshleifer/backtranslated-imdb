The fact that I still think about the film a decade later says a lot about the film. For me, this confirms the Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another. I really believe that before the movie Crash, there was Grand Canyon. The main difference between the two films is, in my opinion, the moment of their release. I will not discuss which one is the best, but I will support the idea that they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this topic. I will start a comment that you can find on http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to post other topics about the films we could share, because I have a real love for the film.
