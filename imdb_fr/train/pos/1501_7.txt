An excellent film and a good example of the fear of a movie without really showing anything to the viewer. This is a series of four stories that revolve around the tenants of a charming old-fashioned house and their horrible and horrible destinies, all linked by a recap story about a Scotland Yard inspector looking for a horror movie star gone. It begins with the story of a mysterious writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic, followed by the story of two old romantic rivals obsessed by a wax figure in a museum, then the story of a small sweet and angelic child anything else, and ending with the story of what happened to the missing movie star and what he did to the inspector. It's a beautiful print that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he could accomplish with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you have a film that can be enjoyed again and again. Do not answer the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls you to offer you a good deal for a beautiful house in the English countryside ??
