I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought it was a theatrical sensation and that Collora could give the opportunity to make a good movie. This trailer did not quite give me the same impression. The story, or the potential story, was pretty good, but because of special effects and special effects, I feel like it would have made a good movie or a TV show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn It's not so good a Superman. I actually thought that during his brief appearance he had made a decent Clark Kent. Sorry, I just do not think of SuperMan as this buff. The costume that Kent wore masked his size. Batman can have the body of a bodybuilder but not a Superman. Supes is tonic without doubt, but not loose. Anyway, I did not care about all his poses and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed tedious. Now, maybe it's not just O'Hearn's fault, Collora may have to take some of the credit for the mediocre scripts and direction. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the special effects for the flight were scary. Superman is flying in the sky. It was obvious that this Superman was flying close to the ground, with telephone cables and buildings visible above him. I do not think there was any shots in Superman's flying body. Obviously, the harness and rigging that supported O'Hearn had to be on his torso. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a good trailer. I would probably pay to see a movie, if any, and I would be sure to watch it on TV. The scenario, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of the lure of Lois for Wayne, Lex and Twoface teaming up to beat Superman and the union of forces between Batman and Superman is a good one. I'm sure with a larger budget and the approval of a full movie, Collora and his company, even O'Hearn could produce a decent movie. Certainly a better than most comic-based shit coming out of Hollywood lately.
