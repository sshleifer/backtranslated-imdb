Look, this is perhaps one of the best movies America can offer to the rest of the world. To hate this film is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the early 80s was a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, Communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. From this confusion came out a hero, Stroker Ace. The performance of Ned Beatty in this film shows that he will never be composed as a one-dimensional victim in the desert. His triumph is an inspiration to all. On-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni makes obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Check out this movie tonight!
