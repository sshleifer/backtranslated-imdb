Sometimes I watch a movie and am really impressed ?? And it's not always easy to explain why I liked that. This is especially true for unusual movies ?? those that can hardly be compared to others. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those special films. There is a lot of emotion in this film ?? and the acting was so good that when I watched the movie, I cried and laughed as the story unfolded. The young Nick Robinson ?? is a young boy (William) evacuated from London because of the air strikes that took place during the Second World War. Mr. Tom, played by John Thaw, is an old man who goes to the village where the evacuees were sent. <br /> <br /> At first, Tom refuses to take on responsibilities - like caring for a troubled boy ?? but accepts because it is left without choice. During the stay, Mr. Tom discovers how horrible William's life was? Beside her luggage, her mother sent a belt and written instructions to her son's host ?? do not hesitate to use it. This belt is sewn into the field ?? never be used so brutally. Mr. Tom provides a real home to William and the boy is happy about his new life. He goes to school, makes new friends and discovers hidden talents. Suddenly, a letter was called to William's house in London with a letter mentioning that she did not feel well ?? and that everything started again ?? only this time, it gets a lot worse ?? There are many feelings you can feel in this movie ?? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and much more. Good evening Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema comparable to others, such as Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot ?? if we have to compare. I really enjoyed watching it and highly recommend it. Before ending this review, I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange as Zac ?? reminded me of one of my friends from my childhood (:
