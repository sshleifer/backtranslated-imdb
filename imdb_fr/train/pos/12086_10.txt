A wonderful family drama / comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. Highly recommended for all ages of 9 years old to grandmas. A beautiful period piece capturing 1962. The story tells the story of Garr, a troubled woman, her two children and Aunt Zena (MacClaine) trying to make ends meet without having to run the home. The "family" heads west to take over the legacy of a long-forgotten family member who left Garr at a cafe by the dilapidated road in the late 1940s. The tenacious Garr, in as a gentle but determined mother, engages the whole family in the restoration and opening of the cafe. But wait ...... Aunt Zena is a former circus artist with card tricks, magic powders and a wacky sense of humor ...... she loves to take the kids and her into stupid games and sometimes dangerous ... What happens next is a delightful combination of "Miracle at Lords" associated with Cuban missile crises (with authentic TV news drawn from the actual event) and a "ghostly" farce that becomes totally uncontrollable. This film entertains, philosopher, questions the religiosity and gives a disturbing glimpse of the terrifying fear of Cuban missile crises of October 1962. In the end, it remains the wonders of the faith, the family and the found love . Oh, and the music of the early 60's is just great! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended as FEEL GOOD FILM 10 out of 10
