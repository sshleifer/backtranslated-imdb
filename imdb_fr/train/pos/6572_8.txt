"Last Action Hero" is one of my favorite movies for several years. Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to ruin my pleasure by becoming a corrupt politician. so now I can not stand any film he could have. <br /> <br /> The adventures of Jake Speed ​​actually play with themes similar to those of Last ... Hero; so I was delighted to find it on DVD to watch these themes play so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the "conspiracy conspiracy" involving white slavery during the civil war of an African country, This is not an action movie. The intrigue in which lies the "plot in a plot" is actually a question that the film does not intend to solve: Jake Speed ​​is he a real person who helps the heroine to save his sister of the trader of white slaves? ; or is he really a fictional character (which means that the heroine has entered one way or another into the universe that really exists only in a series of written novels)? I suggest that it's not quite clearly defined in the film and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are very much aware of it. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the public can expect from such a fictional universe of adventures. It's actually a rich theme, whose kind and friendly sense of humor reduces the potential heaviness of the film. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses in the film - in the first place, its cinematography, which gives it the appearance of a television. show. And the rhythm collapses occasionally. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters and I like their adventure, even if it's stupid. And I find just fascinating the idea that this adventure is really happening in a novel. <br /> <br /> Withstands multiple views - good show!
