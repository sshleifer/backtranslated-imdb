I know some people think the movie is boring but I do not agree. This is the biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I loved the characters in the movie and I think leaving part of Archie's life remains a mystery that has captured her humanity. I do not think the purpose of a good biography should be to detail someone's life, but rather the complexity and the relationships that make it interesting. And what's more fascinating than reinventing yourself with such success? "Men become what they dream, you dreamed well." Good job to Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand has distinguished himself as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more movies.
