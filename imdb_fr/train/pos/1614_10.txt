There is nothing to dislike about Moonstruck. I come from an Italian family in New York and I feel homesick when I look at it. The actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor .. they were all fantastic. It starts a little slowly, but a lot of things happen in two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. On my list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. It's a movie "Have fun" in which you leave the theater humming "What is amore" or repeating some of your favorite phrases: "My old friend if you give these dogs another piece of my food, I will kick you until you die "; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who is dead", "do you love Loretta ..... well because when you do it, they drive you crazy because they know they can do it. " I always put Moonstruck on when there is nothing good to look at because it makes me happy.
