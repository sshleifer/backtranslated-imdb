Let's start by solving the problem: the zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can make them walk, run, the devil even if he wants. That's what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so original. I hate when filmmakers do just like Romero or when fan-fans wait just like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should only look like a typical Romero movie. Again, they do not exist, so a filmmaker can whistle the zombies if he wishes. The zombies of this movie all look very good, but they are obviously not rotting corpses since they are just dead of fear! They are still well done in the air and full of faces and blood chopped. One of the coolest scenes was a half-eaten cat. It was so real that my daughter cried when she saw it. This film had very good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue, which made me want to go see him. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to tasting real horror lovers. 10 of 10! Go rent it!
