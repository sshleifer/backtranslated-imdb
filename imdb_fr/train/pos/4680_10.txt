Terrifying movie with a slow start - give him a chance to start cooking. History creates interest and complexity. The characters and the scenario subvert expectations and clich√©s at the right time. The stunning New York sites - grainy, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to the New York HBO / Hollywood concept of sex and sex. relationships. It's a rare film that treats his characters with such honesty and compassion. I loved! Excellent distribution with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and his love interest (forget his name!).
