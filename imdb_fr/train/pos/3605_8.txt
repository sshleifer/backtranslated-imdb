girlfight uses a well-known formula, as someone pointed out, however, I've seen a lot of movies that do not do it as well or that are not as credible. I think that in the end, it is easier for a woman to understand the character and feel more affected by the film. <br /> <br /> The film encourages both mentally and physically, even if your life and your environment were completely different. and, I think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing that. Although it took 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, it was the film that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> the plot is so familiar / common. the actors are good. but the thoughts it can arouse are what makes it above average in my opinion. it impressed me a lot and I know I'm not the only one.
