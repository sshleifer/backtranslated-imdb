I think it took a lot of courage for her to show up like that. It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers, it is what helps people the most. But in her case, what she did was remarkable. I have been in the mental health field for five years and I think it's great that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I think it helped. I always thought she was great and she will always do it. I'm glad she wrote this book and the film was made. She is a remarkable woman and I hope she will continue to act. She went through a lot of things and faced it. I would really like to see her working more with children, especially child actors. Her ordeal should not have happened and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor for young people. The film was so moving for me that I was very touched. Suffering from a TBI that caused the onset of my disorder and PTSD, it is good to know that someone has the courage to show his life as she did. I think that has helped this nation and people in general to realize that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you Mrs Duke or Anna, what you prefer.
