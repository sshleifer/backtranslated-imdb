I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and I really liked Dana Plato who later played in different shots like Kimberly Drummond. I do not think it's waste. It was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either. it's just a cute children's movie about 3 kids who go after men trying to find the peaty monster. the men are wounded and the children help them with the help of the creature. The beautiful photos of the Arkansas Marsh and the landscape were neat. it's a good film for children, no real violence, some light fears, but fun for young children.
