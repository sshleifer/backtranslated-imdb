As other critics have noted, this is an unjustly neglected film from the Depression era. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave it to Paradise, The Westerner, Lifeboat, etc.), it is a hard, structured and realized movement on the inhabitants of a shantytown of new York City. . They are biters, beggars and women forced to prostitute themselves, but they form a community of good and bad people, with loyalties as complex as those of any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the main admirable qualities of this film is the contrast between Spencer Tracy's character, Bill and Trina by Loretta Young. He speaks loudly, physically aggressively, and obviously without fear - but Bill is not the character who gives this film his keen sense of survival. While he slams, Trina really clings (if this term can apply to such a feminine character). His dedication to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says that she will raise it herself if he wants to leave, or "I'll even give up the girl if you're only happy." That is the dignity of the performance of Loretta Young (at age 20) as a rather simple character, she does not seem weak or dependent, but rather as a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing .
