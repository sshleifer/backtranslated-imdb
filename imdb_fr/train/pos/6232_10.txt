One of the best films of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> Great songs including "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All". My eggs in a basket. "The last song is introduced by Astaire, who plays a jazzy piano and then a nice dance with Rogers, Rogers also sings" Let Yourself Go "with Grable among the alternate singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays the cute sister of Rogers. "Get Be You Behind Me" is a song that is close to your heart for days, she also sings "But where are you?" Snappy and fast, This entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the best, and the classic and amazing finale, "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is among the best-known of their numbers, and Rogers wears one of the greatest dresses in history. from film ... a glittering glittering number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and sees herself slightly ... Just beautiful, this is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters recreated Pennies from Heaven Penn / Randolph Scott seems an alright choice nge as a friend of Astaire, but he also appeared in Roberta with Irene Dunne. Fortunately, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger roles in 1936, but they have some scenes and have little impact. Allwyn has the most important role but is only OK. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of his best solo numbers in the series with "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and Thumping is a great song. <Br /> <br /> Fun to the end, although I got tired of "We joined the Navy" after the third time ....
