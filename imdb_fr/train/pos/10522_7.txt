It's a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border to the gadget, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look a boring television soap in costumes, since the whole story is based on dialogue. <br /> <br /> The acting is competent. Ms. Paltrow is distant, as her character requires, but the distance required from other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment of her own actions. In other words, it does not seem to care enough about the results of its twinning efforts. Some actors are guilty of overprinting - very much in the style appreciated on stage but moved in the movies. Personally, I had a hard time accepting Alan Cumming in the role of Mr. Elton - no fault of his, except to have left an impression of trolley gay in "The High Life" that it is now difficult to accept it playing a serious role. . Acting honors are awarded to Toni Collette, who manages to emit warmth, and Jeremy Northam, who presents his character at the right level.
