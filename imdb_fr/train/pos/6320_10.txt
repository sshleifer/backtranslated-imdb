The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the beautiful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in a movie is amazing without seeing it. But this film caught me off guard. It was not what I expected. I have not seen it for a long time, but I remember that I could not help but laugh! And it's not just the cast that did it for me. The script was incredibly written. Whenever you expected something, it did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but that corresponded to the tone of the film instead of pretending to be pretentious. The cinematography, as well as the whole, was absolutely beautiful. I can not really say anything bad about this movie! Expcept, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more time on the screen!
