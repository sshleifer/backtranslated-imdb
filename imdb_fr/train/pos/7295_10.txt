I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both very impressed by the complexity of the plot and found it emotional. It was very well directed with strong images. The visual effects were incredible, especially for a short film. He tackled a very real and serious subject with an original fantasy approach: this film is about a girl who has a demon offering to help him improve his situation with his violent father. There is also a surprise surprise in the end that caught me off guard. This leans towards the Gothic feeling. I would like to see this as a feature film. - Carrie
