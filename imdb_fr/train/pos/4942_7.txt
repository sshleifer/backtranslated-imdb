I must admit that during the first half hour or so of this film, I was almost lost. There had been a slightly amusing humor, but at best a basic plot and a general sense of uselessness that was about to make me think I was wasting my time. Then, for no apparent reason, I suddenly realized that I appreciated that. There was no blinding moment of realization and no sudden, dramatic scene that took me. In fact, nothing very exciting happens in the whole movie. It was as if I suddenly realized that the movie was supposed to be largely useless - and that it was its charm that made it so charming. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman starred in an anonymous actor who finds small project "to revive his career." He will play the role of supermarket manager and spends the day in a neighborhood supermarket looking While there, he meets and connects with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a cashier who wants more of life and helps her prepare for a job interview, as if she auditioning for a role, while making him discover real life It's really fun to watch "him" (because that's how the character is identified in the credits) to be overwhelmed by a visit to the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega have been great together, with a strange but completely romantic kind of chemistry but father-daughter.If you feel lost at the beginning, persevere.In the end, the film is delightfully charming.
