Deodato brings us slightly shocking moments and a film that does not take itself too seriously. Absolutely a classic in its particular genre. This film offers a different look at the barbarians. If you have the chance to see this movie, do it. You will definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it's funny or something banal like that, but because it's so bad that it goes the other way and becomes good, but maybe not clean, fun.
