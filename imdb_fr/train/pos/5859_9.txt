This cool Marvel superhero game makes a beautiful homage by staying true to the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman is improving in both departments. It also contains the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of the Spiderman comics. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, Spiderman does everything a spider can. He does more than spin paintings. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he does not use the Internet in combat, he also hits. Spidey has his hands full when fighting Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus, to name a few. Look for Captain America in a monochrome. <br /> <br /> Most levels are difficult, but some require patience to be beaten. The only criticism that can be made about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a true Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you, but do not expect a long gameplay. Best chance in "Spiderman 2." My rating: 9 out of 10
