I've always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street" so when I heard there was a movie about reunion, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was a pleasure to see everyone again, but the greatest pleasure of all was to meet Andr√© Braugher, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss has always been the strongest part of a great show.
