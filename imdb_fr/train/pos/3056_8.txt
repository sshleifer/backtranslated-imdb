I had placed this on my TIVO for a rainy day because of the cast, of people really working hard in the industry, and when I finally watched I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie has some flavor Altman (It is mentioned in the ending credits as a "thank you" person) using seemingly unrelated and unrelated plots that mingle as the movie pulls in. its peak. Macy is pure, clean and honest as a man who can not seem to escape her "destiny", Sutherland plays and interprets as many people as possible. Neve adds a sparkle to a deliberately toned down environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember Mission Impossible on TV?), Not to mention the faithful John Ritter and you have all the ingredients to make a good movie. The script is refined, the dialogue is free of clich√© and reflected (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Suspend belief and enjoy, it's really time well spent.
