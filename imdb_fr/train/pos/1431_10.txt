It's just the most amazing movie you can see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it's really something else. He does not try to teach you anything, he shows you how life in nature works. <br /> <br /> I will not speak about the quality of the images, because you know of course, from other comments, that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The Earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first film that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and what a treasure we have been blessed with, but we do not do not like it at all. <Br /> <br /> This film should be presented as compulsory in schools. It's the most wonderful movie you can see, so go see it. Who knows, maybe this is the last time we'll see our planet like this ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I'd easily evaluate if it was possible.
