Ok, even if you can not stand Liza- this movie is really hilarious! The scenes with John Gielgud compensate Liza. One of the true classics of romantic comedy of the 20th century. Dudley Moore gives a cute and fun look to being drunk and irresponsible. It's really fun to watch! The one-liners are the best.
