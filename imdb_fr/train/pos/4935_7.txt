In New Orleans, an irregular immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the little criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is pursued by Blackie and his men, Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, the Commander of the family, Commander Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Service, discovered that the deceased had pneumonic plague caused by rats and that he had to find out who had any contact with the man in the forty years. Eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The City Mayor instructs skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint find and vaccinate the plague-infected killers. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the Streets" reveals a simple story. but he is still efficient and with a big bad guy. The engaging plot is not out of date after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance makes a despicable scum in his debut and the work of the camera while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "PÃ¢nico nas Ruas" ("Panic in the streets")
