Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie because it has no connection with the first two films of Demons. And with the "demons III" in the title, one could assume that this would be the case. The problem is that this movie was never designed to be part of the Demons series. Distributors only a "Demons III" over its original title "The Ogre" to take advantage of the popularity of other films. The new American DVD version of this image is titled "Demons III: The Ogre" on the cardboard, but the film itself only says "The Ogre". I do not know if previous versions had the title "Demons III" on the film itself, but this new version just seems to be a little lie. If you can do without the "Demons III" in the title, you can have fun in "The Ogre". It starts with a creep intro and stays pretty slippery. There is no gore and movie films slowly, but I have dug it yet. But do not expect it to be like other Demons movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it.
