It's a totally delicious and unexpected movie. You start by following a youngster who hopes to participate in the qualifying football match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will participate in the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the girl is a girl and girls (or women elsewhere) are not allowed to attend football matches to "sit with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, played with talent by a small team. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on women's freedom (and indeed the young soldiers who must correct them). There are excellent plays, especially when one of the girls has to go to the bathroom and, of course, the stadium does not have a toilet for women. The camera work is very simple and in some ways this story could have been told as a play. Yet it is the small scale that gives the movie a hard time. Great cinema? No, probably not great entertainment - for sure.
