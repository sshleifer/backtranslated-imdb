In what is unquestionably the best outdoor adventure film of all time, four city dwellers face the wrath of nature, in a story of survival. Georgia, with its forests, mountains and wild rivers, is the ideal place. <br /> <br /> The director, John Boorman, chose to appeal to the local population and not actors to interpret secondary characters. These premises imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in the history of the film. No "actor" of central casting could ever approach the faces, voices or remarkable actions of these people. I do not remember a movie in which the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. It is above all this realism that makes this film so amazing. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is another strength. Nature: in the wild, can be violent. How appropriate that the parameter should be the South American. Very few places in the United States are, or have been, as violent as a redneck country. In a story about the survival of the fittest Darwinian, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature and are not separated from it. <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is really a product of his time when, unlike today, Americans have expressed concern over an endangered desert. The magnificent landscapes of the film, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets and the roaring rapids associated with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. And that's another highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> At the level of shows, the tension rises as the plot unfolds. Not even halfway through the movie, the tension becomes extreme, then never drop, not before the final credits. Very few films can support such a level of intensity on such a long plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, the technical quality of the film is remarkable. The steering and mounting are perfect. The cinematography is excellent. The dialogue is interesting. And the acting is great. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a good job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it's the music that seems shy. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Deliverance" will certainly appeal to viewers who enjoy outdoor adventure. Even for those who do not, the granular characterizations, the acting and the tension of the plot are sufficient reasons to watch this film, one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema.
