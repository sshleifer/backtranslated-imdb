Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first color film, is a gloomy look at the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers, essentially a series of overlapping vignettes depicting several groups of people living a perilous existence in a shanty town. after the war, hard and carefree. . Between comedy and tragedy, this film shows how people face the worst kind of life, each in their own way, mostly withdrawing and living in the imaginary world of their own minds, emotionally withdrawing from those around them or drowning in alcohol. Mixing realism sink and kabuki theatricality, Kurosawa plays with emotion with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughing with equal skill. A wonderful and exhausting experience.
