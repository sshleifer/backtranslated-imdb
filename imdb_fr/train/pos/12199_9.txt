The first mystery is to guess what the original Welles movie was like. This makes it a real adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and use the judicial investigation film, imagine the beautiful woman he has already supported. <br /> <br /> If you do, you will see and experience perhaps one of the best movies. mysteries never. As the mysteries say, the story is rather ordinary: a simple diversion, a jealous husband like a red herring. <br /> <br /> What is rather miraculous is the placement of Welles' story in an artificial eye that sees a dark and multifaceted world. The first true black, but even darker. It's not a visibly crooked world unless you think about the camera. What we can see first hand is someone who creates a vocabulary that will become common later. <br /> <br /> Kane was a success thanks to his great drama and his story. The eye of the camera was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore the story of mystery and the reference of Shakespeare with this look. Othello and MacBeth are both started at this time and I consider them as part of a single vision. <br /> <br /> The black spirit here is based on the idea that people are not responsible for their lives, even a little - they are manipulated by random factors of the environment. In telling this story, Welles must make the environment a character. Several characters as suspects in the mystery. <br /> <br /> We have the famous lights, blockages and angles we know (and have seen countless times since). And we have the deliberately closed sets: the park, the yacht, the picnic area, the aquarium, the dock, the courtroom, the Chinese theater and the fun. I am convinced that what the barbarians have cut is a bunch of "external" stories that do not deal with character but with these strange environments. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it, among other character environments introduced as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of Black Irish (which we know by footnotes and typing in the lobby was an aspiring novelist) was neither a force of human conspiracy (the park or the civilized version, the courtroom) or nature. (the picnic or the civilized version, the aquarium). <br /> <br /> It was rather a deliberate whim on the part of the gods for entertainment. This is of course a reference to what Welles is doing: putting these people (including himself) in hell for our own whim, an issue underlined by the Beijing Opera setting where Welles is doped. And of course, we go to the entertainment center where the environment tinkers directly with perception. <br /> <br /> To know more about the reference of oneself: there is surely a conscious comment on his relation with his future wife. But I believe there are strong subconscious comments about his own mockery of the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Welles was surely as fucked up with his character and the same way. And this hogwash took the form of the murder of this film, leaving the decomposing corpse mentioned at the beginning of this commentary. <br /> <br /> Poor Rita, a native of China, binds everything, the Chinese theater, the theater rape expected from above, the loss of the woman. Investment in the environment beyond everything.
