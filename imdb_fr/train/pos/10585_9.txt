Footlight Parade is one of the best extravaganzas of the 1930s musical. A vivid scenario and a cast of stars including Jimmy Cagney, the ravishing Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler make this movie one piece above the others. Directed and choreographed by creative genius Busby Berkeley, this film will make you smile from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Of course, Busby is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "42nd Street" to his credit (as director of dance). Footlight Parade is honored by hundreds of barely-dressed choir girls, a trademark of Berkeley. The elaborate dance numbers were shot with one camera and Busby was the first director to shoot close-ups of the dancers. His obsession with shapely legs and "recoil" plans is amply demonstrated here. The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> Our boy, Jimmy Cagney, plays Chester Kent, producer of "prologues" or short musical productions that have been presented in cinemas to entertain the public before the talks. shown. He is surrounded by dishonest partners, a corporate spy and a girlfriend who searches for gold. Although Cagney has a strong background in vaudeville, this is the first film in which he shows his dancing skills. Joan Blondell is memorable as a love secretary to Cagney. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always. <br /> <br /> The film culminates with three exceptional production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each of which is a masterpiece and unlikely to be reproduced in Hollywood. today, where so-called "special effects" have replaced creative cinematography. <br /> <br /> Claudia's conclusion: Clever and erotic, with some of the best musical production numbers ever produced on celluloid. A period of depression very pleasant.
