Finally, a thriller that omits car chases, explosions and other catchy effects. The film combines a simple plot (the assassination of a French president) with an excellent background. He examines the behavior of men with the authorities and explains why we would obey almost all the orders (even of assassination) that would be given to us. <br /> <br /> In addition, it shows us how secret service history and how difficult they can be controlled. The best thing about this film is that there is no classic "Hollywood ending" that can be easily predicted.
