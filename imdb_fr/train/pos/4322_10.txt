Perhaps you will not be interested in the social commentary, or in the filmmakers' point of view (I am myself mystified by the angle of "insignificance" that Kasdan seemed to promote - while clearly, the actions taken in the film favored SOME ending confusing me). However, one can not deny the way in which history is presented; the magnificent symbolism all along; threaded character arcs; visual; dialogue ?? is an absolute masterpiece. I have watched the film dozens of times and I am always amazed at its perfection. There is not a moment, an action, a cut or a line that does not have everything to do with the theme. Realistic human performance of all actors. Stage scene, it is fantastically woven. <br /> <br /> I have a fairly flat sound meter. The ringtone never went off during this movie. If you are a thinker (rather than an occasional spectator) ?? This film offers. Exponentially. Absolutely hypnotic. (Do you agree with the message to appreciate the display?) No matter if it made you hot and blurry or not, was it interesting? <br /> <br /> I personally touch ?? significantly. In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The front-page reviewer clearly speaks of an erroneous Afro-American perception. What he may not have recognized is that there was a hand ?? shake. Not a gift. "The spiritually dead white man", simply saw a man to respect and admire. And he did something about it. The fact that it is black has little, if anything, to do with it (the color simply serves to draw the parallel.) And the abyss It is no coincidence that the opening sequence goes from black and white to color). If you see black people in this movie as "token" ?? you may want to re-evaluate your anxiety. You may only see black and white, huh. Just a thought.
