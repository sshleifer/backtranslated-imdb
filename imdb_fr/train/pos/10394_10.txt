A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS from British cinema have mixed fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! Some of Technicolor's most delightful debut, a SUBLIME and shimmering musical score by Miklos Rozsa, as well as Sabu's juvenile exuberance, Conrad Veidt's theatrical and malevolent villainy, and June Duprez's exquisite voice as a princess, work wonders. Miles Malleson, who interprets the father of Duprez, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect scenario, which is at the height of greatness. DO NOT MISS IT! Since I posted the comments above, I got the recently released DVD and can honestly say that I had never seen the picture properly until I saw that version of the DVD. The clarity and resolution are so precise and the colors so vivid that I was stunned. Amazing classic can be watched a while and still and never fails to charm and delight the viewer. Once again, a must!
