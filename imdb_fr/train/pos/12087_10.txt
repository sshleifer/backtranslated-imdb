I tried my luck on "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying the first season (Canadian version) of Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I was instantly hooked after that. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I rate it 10 stars here. It's just that good. What I liked were the opening and closing themes, and of course the Stephen J. Cannell logo at the end of each episode, but especially the relationship between Judge and Mark as they worked together to solve each case. I was so hooked that I also bought the second season as a companion and enjoyed it too. If you do not have this great record series, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
