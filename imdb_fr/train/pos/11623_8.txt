(You'll know what I mean after seeing Red Eye ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, Red Eye was a better than expected thriller. It starts slowly and slowly builds itself. But by the time it was over, it's a thunder! <br /> <br /> It's hard to define exactly what makes this thriller as thrilling as I found it. Except that, quite simply, the director did an honorable job in dragging you into what would have otherwise been a trivial plot. I tend to forget that I was watching a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, in my opinion, are the "coming together" of the victim and the bad guy ... and over time, you start to really relate to the victim. A bit 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but it's pretty good!
