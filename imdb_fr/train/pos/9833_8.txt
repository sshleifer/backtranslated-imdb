A terrorist tries to steal a very secret biological weapon and, trying to escape, is infected when the file containing the lethal agent is compromised. The soldiers are able to recover the case, but the terrorist goes to a hotel where he tries to hide. They end up where he hides and "cleans" the hotel and its occupants. Unfortunately, they have his body cremated and if you have seen The Return of the Living Dead, you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 has been widely criticized by critics and zombie fans as a complete mess of a movie. Although it is a fair evaluation, it is not without strengths. On the one hand, there are many bloody deaths to keep hunting dogs happy. There is an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from anywhere possible. They are in the water, in the beams of the houses, hidden in trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a pile of dead scrubs, and then launch into an attack while the heroes are trying to escape. There is even a flying zombie head hiding inside a refrigerator. You have to see it to believe it, because this scene forces Zombie 3 to watch IMO. There may be terrible editing and very questionable productions, especially from the doctor, who must be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining film . Sometimes it's nice to sit down and watch a movie that requires nothing more than its time and open mind. Zombie 3 corresponds to this bill, and then some. It's even more enjoyable if you open a few beers and look at it with friends like that. I give it a 8/10, just because of pure pleasure.
