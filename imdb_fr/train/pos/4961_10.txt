Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched couple who get in the car and go shopping according to the needs of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is superbly human and has relationships with everyone, while Paz Vega is the forward-thinking cashier behind the "10 Items or Less" order line, intimidating customers and bored. Together, they explore, discover and learn from each other. To do this, they must obviously be vulnerable, be interested in change and have a sense of humor, which they both have. I hope this film is realistic, that this type of story happens more often. I wish we did not go to the movies to realize that we can actually communicate with each other even if we come from very different backgrounds. The film's message is based on an open heart and leads us to question the possibility of another world where we meet from there - a world where peace could be a possibility.
