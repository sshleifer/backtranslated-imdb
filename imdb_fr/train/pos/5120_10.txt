Fast and simple, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As other people have already mentioned, I'm not from the south either, I do not really like country music and I've never worn a cowboy hat. boy. (I've never been in a car with a corpse in my trunk either, but I love "Goodfellas".) It's a great movie. Shot in a 2.35 image format and beautifully transferred to DVD. (The VHS was 1.33 in full screen). And yes, a solid blend 5.1 for your enjoyment. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a story of love / hate story taking place in Texas, with great performances. Travolta is fantastic. Next to "Pulp Fiction", it's the best thing he's done. It's been 25 years since I was part of my top 5! <br /> <br /> Discover this one !!! It's a 10 !!!!
