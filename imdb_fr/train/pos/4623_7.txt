Despite his rather salacious title, this is a light dramedy teen. Unless you are an old fool, you will probably find it nice. It's not so good to develop characters or situations smoothly, though. When you look at it, you have the feeling that you ran into the kitchen, even though you spent the time watching it. This is one of those movies that matters a lot to your characters, and they are quite appealing. Jennifer Connelly is the idol of many, I know, but I have always loved the darker Maddie Corman. Teens spend most of their time on the screen without much intrusion from these pesky adults. Is it just me or do most young men look very much alike?
