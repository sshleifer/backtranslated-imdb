Although originally reluctant to watch "Lost," I accidentally caught an episode at the beginning of Season 1 - the one with the polar bear - and it has been my attention ever since. The show is. Not the polar bear. So, bear with me while I throw praises as divine as possible, semi-coherent. <br /> <br /> "Lost" evokes a simple idea: a flight of passengers full of people heading to the desert island, and gradually adds an extraordinary depth to its principle by exploring each character thoroughly and seamlessly - what motivates them, who are they? Where do they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island on which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they are fleeing something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or coming into contact with spirituality ( Locke, Claire). . But "Lost" also looks at the island itself and the mysteries of its horror ... and they all seem strangely related. <br /> <br /> Although television actors are not known for their subtlety or brilliance. Most of the actors in "Lost" are, in fact, spectacular actors for their respective roles, projecting their hearts and humor into their performances. There is also a multitude of eyelids, but not generally Hollywood-style plastics like most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and they are extremely attractive to watch. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable scepiness, petty arguing or cheese melodrama (even if they are secretly boring) ?? these people are trying to survive, and any apparent relationship is treated as a secondary action. The realism of these characters facilitates a plot already well carved. <br /> <br /> About this parcel ... Imagine a tree as a model parcel, then the branches as subplots (in this case, a branch for each character) ?? Well, Lost adds twigs to each branch, then tiny twigs to these twigs and other stories. If you are a brother / sister of one of the main characters of flashbacks, you will have your own script. If you are a dog, you will have your own scenario. Unless the writers succeed in bringing them all together to arrive at a glorious culmination, they set themselves up. I'm more than a little worried that there will be a disappointing loophole to this show, as I'm sure most people are. <br /> <br /> But assuming the writers remove this, "Lost" is perhaps the best TV show of all time. <br /> <br /> 9/10
