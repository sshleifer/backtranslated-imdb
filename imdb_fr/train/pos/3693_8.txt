It's not easy to make a movie with 18 different stories. Although 18 different international directors have taken up the challenge, not everyone is good, some are even boring. But in his entity, "Paris, I love you" is breathtaking, showing that, as "Love Actually" says, "love is all around", especially in the city of love. Here is a summary (which I will try to do with as little detail as possible) of 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - a sort of dull opening sequence, nothing really special about it. A man finds a parking place and sees many couples passing by, wondering why he can not find a girl. And then, suddenly, a woman fainted next to her car ... <br /> <br /> SEINE QUAYS - another dull sequence, about three teenagers looking for a "little ass", when suddenly a Muslim The girl travels in front of them and gets help from one of the boys. Really basic, but with a soft heart. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - It was a huge disappointment! Although the story of the great Van Sant could have interested a love story between two boys of artistic origin. Finally, all that comes after Ulliel's monologue is good, all before it gets boring. <br /> <br /> TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence of the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without even saying a word - is hypnotic and the whole sequence is hilarious. It kept me hooked to the end, and it also makes you really addicted to the film. <br /> <br /> FAR FROM THE 16TH - a beautiful story too, even if the execution is mediocre, the heart is there. This is the story of a Hispanic woman who drops off her child early in the morning to look after another baby from the suburbs. Pretty. <br /> <br /> CHOISY DOOR - this segment must be the strangest and strangest of all the movie. A kind of shampoo seller arrives in a place resembling that of Chinatown in Paris. If I understand correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. BASTILLE - a really beautiful sequence. A man meets his wife in a restaurant to break up with her and run away with her mistress. But the woman has devastating news. Pretty basic, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE OF WINS - such a sad sequence. Juliette Binoche plays a mother in mourning. One night, she wakes up when she hears her dead child. When she arrives at the scene, a cowboy tells her that she can say goodbye to her child. One of the best segments! EIFFEL TOWER - Two mimes who fall in love could have been great, but even though the movie contains some cool stuff, the story is neither fascinating nor amusing. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - a real original and brilliant sequence, one of the best of the movie! A girl and an older man discuss their future and their fear for a certain man ... Cuaron does an excellent job as a director and the actors are extraordinary! RED CHILDREN'S DISTRICT - An American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. PLACE DES FETES: a woman comes to see a homeless man, he starts talking to her in a romantic way ... because she is the love of her life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new sensations in their relationship ... very funny and unromantic, Pigalle is a disappointment. <br /> <br /> MADELEINE DISTRICT - bringing diversity to the film, QdlM is a relief. A young man (Wood) finds a vampire killing a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Dark, scary and strangely romantic, Madeleine is superb. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another disappointing segment. Directed by Wes Craven and performed by stars like Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is simply ordinary, not original at all. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are true, Twyker's the short film is beautiful, beautiful and well done. A blind man picks up the phone and learns from his girlfriend (Portman - really stunning) that she breaks up with him. He reflects on their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment was co-directed by Depardieu and counts stars such as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also disappointing. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry between the actors. <br /> <br /> 14th BOROUGH - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American tells in her French class her trip to Paris. Her French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment, she realizes that Paris is much more than what we perceive. <br /> <br /> With Feist in the background, "Paris, I love each other" ends in a soft tone, not letting me down at all, even if some segments were boring me a lot, the entity the movie is great! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, I really love you!
