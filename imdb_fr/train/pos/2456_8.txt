When I went to see this film, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to watch a boring teen movie, BUT in fact, the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was pretty compelling - especially from Melville who really shows his talent in this movie and the fight scenes were - for a low-budget movie - done very well. <br /> <br /> I think this film deserves a larger audience than the one it received. It's a movie that can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of kids, because it contains rather difficult scenes. A film about the love and the problems that can arise when you break the traditions of your family. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie looks a lot like "Fold it like Beckham", but I think it actually does better.
