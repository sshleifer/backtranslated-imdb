This film is a remake of two films that were much better. The last, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see it. This one is not so great. The last third of the film is not so bad and Chris Rock begins to show some of the comical pleasures that brought him to the current situation. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this film. He plays like a very bad movie "B" where people seem to be in a bad sit-com on TV. The situations are forced and it is as if they were trying to make the story to be able to start the real movie. All this seems wrong and editing is just bad. I do not know how they could release this movie like this. Anyway, the last part is not so bad, so wait for the video and then watch it.
