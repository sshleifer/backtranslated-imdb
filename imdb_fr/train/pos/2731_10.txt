Sorry, I do not have a lot of time to write. I am not a psychologist but I have known him for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extraordinarily well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but could not control himself superbly. I agree! What a scary and wonderful movie. I've seen more than 2,000 movies and ranked it in the top 100. My longtime friend deals regularly with clients like these. My only criticism was the narration preached at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances, but only one in a million will behave like those two losers.
