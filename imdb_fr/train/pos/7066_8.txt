This film is so old that I never realized how young Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember playing him in a big movie, "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, a very wealthy banker. Three girls in this picture are not very happy about the separation of their father and mother and discover that their father is going to marry a young blonde gold digger looking for a rich sugar dad. They hire a man who presents himself as a very rich earl, his name is Count Ariszted (Misha Auer), who is drunk all the time and who is penniless and gives a lot of comical laughs to the picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the police chief that she was an opera star. the convicts began to applaud, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene in this film. This is the first time Deanna Durbin made her film debut. She wins an instant success in one night and becomes a big movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
