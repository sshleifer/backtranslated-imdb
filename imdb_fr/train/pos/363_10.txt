This film is about development. People are growing and disappearing, people are surprising and people are disappointing. He has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hate. It's really a classic drama that has fantastic performances from all the actors, but especially from Whoopi Goldberg in his first role. <br /> <br /> This film made me feel very human and proud, and I suggest that this film be mandatory every Saturday in every prison in the world - it affects your compassion. Note: 10 out of 10. PS: I admit it: I shed a tear of joy during the final scene.
