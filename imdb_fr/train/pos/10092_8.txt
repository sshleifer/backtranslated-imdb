The brilliant Elizabeth Taylor is the star of this lesser-known classic as a London girl who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). When she arrives, she immediately feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture while being constantly aware of the flock of angry elephants. William Dieterle, who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie, does a remarkable job in bringing a somewhat dark and almost strange note to this novel and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen black and white theme mansion and the beautiful landscape of the island.
