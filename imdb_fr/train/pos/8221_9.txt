Soudden Impact is the 4th of Dirty Harry's films, and one of the best features of these films is that they do not really break down as one movie to another. Thus, Sudain Impact provides another thrilling adventure through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry tries to solve a series of murders during his vacation. Harry always seems to work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate and fearless. As the first Dirty Harry movie to be shot in the 80s, Sudden Impact lacks a bit of the 70s feel that characterizes the first three films. This does not mean that its quality is lower. Conclusion: Suddenly brimming with intensity and action, Sudden Impact is a valuable addition to the Dirty Harry series.
