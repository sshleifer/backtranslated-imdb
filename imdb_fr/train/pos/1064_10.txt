I just wondered why FOX had canceled the season3 while season 2 was not as good as season 1 which is excellent indeed! I love it so much that I even think about buying a DVD on Amazon. (Missed !: _ (I am a Chinese student and it is inconvenient for me to get an international credit card and $), I hope that FOX will be able to bring back DA someday!
