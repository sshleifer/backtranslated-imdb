So what is the reason? Is there any kind of vendetta against this AWESOME show or someone involved in it? Why would the best show I've seen in years be canceled? I'm addicted. Last fall, I saw this program at random, and I immediately loved it and watched it every week. Then he left and I tried to do it in Tivo, but it was not broadcast. So I forgot about it for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now, I want more. I agree with everyone - with the rest of the junk food on TV today, it was refreshing to see something as complete and developed as this one. I look at Boston Legal for my eccentric-comic solution, and House for my intellectual-silly-idiot solution. My wife likes Gray's Anatomy for her "realism", and I like / hate the show, but that could not be further from the real for me. Too much drama. Anything that can go wrong happens. But for once, there is a drama that is REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Of course, there are extremes like a former gangster become good, a girl who flees the crowd, etc., but these people (especially in New York) are really there and I identify with each one of them . I can not get enough. I just hope that ABC will get out of their bean counters buttocks and continue this show. Get a little respect for having a quality drama on the market. This could be one of the best shows of all time. If someone just wants to leave it.
