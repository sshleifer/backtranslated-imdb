Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" did not arrive too late or was even superfluous. He is one of the few who tries to deal with the second sad aspect of the war: the time after. Different from the movies like "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo" that featured their main characters as broken heroes in a catastrophic post-war environment, this film allows the audience to face a different point of view about Vietnamese veterans . Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragedy, there is always a sense of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" is perhaps the quietest Vietnamese film in history, but after almost 15 years, it's really plausible and therefore justified. Moreover, this can make us believe that the war is not over yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are extraordinary. De Niro did one of his best jobs but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. It was perhaps his best performance of all time.
