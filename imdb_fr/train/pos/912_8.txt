This film recalls many memories of classical cinema, where actors did not have to undress to allow viewers to watch their film. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the main benefit of this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely filming. <br /> <br /> I have seen many comments about the fact that the film is sickly, sweet and too sticky. In response to that, I think that, to a certain extent, it is a correct analysis. However, in the case of a Barjatya film, I think that compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been considerably attenuated. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film however, when the sentimental moments come, you find yourself smiling, wishing the best to the nascent couple and hoping that nothing bad happens to them. <br /> <br /> The performances of Shahid and Amrita are another major advantage. Both played very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the movie. Amrita is simply beautiful and should be taken seriously as a future major star. <br /> <br /> Although I really enjoyed the film as a whole, I think it was too long. Some of the middle might have been cut and that might have even more impact. I also think that the music, although it fits in the film when we see the situations, is a little outdated and the film could have benefited if a more modern soundtrack had been available. Although putting in pictures Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein is wonderful. <br /> <br /> In the end, I highly recommend this film, its romantic, its beautiful and its dramatic climax (I will not go into details, just in case you have not seen it. br /> <br /> PS If you are inclined to cry, take a tissue (I needed several)
