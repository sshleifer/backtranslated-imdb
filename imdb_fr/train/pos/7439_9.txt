Ancient Mariner is a truly classic work, like the original poem. The context / setting with the old sailor himself is good, clear and unpretentious. The artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem corresponds perfectly to the time / the setting and the work itself, leading the audience in this period with an ever-so moving accompaniment, using excellent motion strategies as well as conquered by the producers of the pre-MTV era and much less apparent in the more current works. (MTV has brought to television and video a static movement through often inappropriate cuts, from theme to theme, without moving forward and without clear relationships in theme or script.) The voice, intonation and vitality of Redgrave's reading gives life to this touching poem. with all his fear, his arguments and his pain. In addition, the fluid movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and sometimes monotonous (in this case, a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) of the author's interpretation of the sad narrative and sinister of the old sailor. It is a must for any love of classical poetry, the sea, a high tale that sounds almost real and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and our culture. Who does not understand the meaning of an "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A very beautiful experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilva, for updating this for us, to never be forgotten.
