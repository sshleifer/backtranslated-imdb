Rohmer departs from his usual portraits of the French middle class to tell this drama of costumes the difficulties of an aristocratic woman during the French Revolution. What's more appealing in "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is Rohmer's fabulous aesthetic. The images have been digitally decorated too and look like baroque images. At times, you can not really tell if you're watching a movie or a series of images at the Louvre Musseum. Each photo is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My price: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> --- ----------- - <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> - --------- ---------
