Always enjoy Drew Barrymore's great acting and superb performance in this film, where she plays a very complicated girl (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Parts", 2000, who leaves New York to go to California and shares a apartment with a promising writer, George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. Holly begins to live strange things and she tries to find her brother in a psychiatric facility after the murder of his father. If you look closely enough, you will actually see Drew Barrymore's mother appear in real life like her mother in this picture. If it was not for the good game of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be seen on Halloween night! However, sure there are surprises in the end !!!!
