Hoping to see a "cute little movie" from mainland China, I was poorly prepared. Family dynamics, community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored with such discernment. Each character is solid and I was completely drawn to the story. The organization is much more complex than the American public will be used to. However, there is no difficulty in following the progress, even when playing subtitles. Jiang Wu, as a retarded brother, shines constantly. Leave your cynicism in your locker. This will be there when you check.
