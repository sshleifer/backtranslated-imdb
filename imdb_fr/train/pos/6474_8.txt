I totally trained in this area and I could not wait for each episode. The acting game revealed how much a missing person in the family should be emotional, as well as the effects it would have on the closest. The only problem we had as a family was the speed with which everything was explained in the end. We could not hear clearly what was said and had no idea from Gary in all of this. Why did Kyle call him and why did he accept? After investing in a series for five hours, we felt deceived that only five minutes were retained for the conclusion. I asked around and none of my friends who looked at him were so wise. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????
