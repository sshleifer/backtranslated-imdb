At first, it comes from England, so of course, I had a 98% chance that it is smart and very good cinema. I had never heard of this movie before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I thought, Oh! Here is the female version of My left foot. I was right, but I was wrong too. False because both films are very different. My left foot was a film similar to John Ford and this one is a movie similar to Chaplin (not because it's funny, but Chaplin to that great sense of melodrama that makes you cry at the eyes.) I was right because that in 1990, the handsome Daniel Day-Lewis becomes a little ugly playing with a cripple and he does so with a great sense of reality. Here, the beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter is one of the greatest women in the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look at his eyes! She has the most beautiful cinema eyes since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She is also a real talent, as we see in many other films. See this one, you will not regret it! And a very good job of Branagh too!
