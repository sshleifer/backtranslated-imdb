First, I have to give it to the people who put this thing in place. September 11th is such a delicate issue that it is very difficult to make a film that dares to be controversial. It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that the film was banned in the United States. <br /> <br /> That said, I think the film is superb with some weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian segment, which is somewhat reminiscent of the work of Majid Majidi (the absolutely beautiful "children of paradise" and "the color of paradise"). Just like these two films, the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of Afghan refugees in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. Ditto for Sean Penn's video, which is also superb. But some clips are beautiful, others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu directed the Mexican video and, just like his heart-rending "Amores perros", he did it as brutally as possible. Most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds in the background. These noises come from the journalists and their shock when the second plane crashes, from those who called their homes from the burning towers and left messages to their families, those who were angry ... and he associates this with flashes of people jumping laps. . A clip very difficult to watch and you will never forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips may be very hard for Americans to watch, as some might be interpreted as "you are not the only ones who suffer". In particular, the Egyptian and British clips that not only say that, but reverse the roles and say how much the United States has suffered from the suffering that others have caused. <br /> <br /> I will also make a special mention to the clips of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although the latter may seem terribly out of place, it really is not). <br /> <br /> However, not all clips are great and I make a special mention on the clip. from Israel which, in my opinion, is extremely weak. Even if the idea was good (a journalist is on the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but his story is screwed up because of what happened in New York is something that many of those who live in war-torn countries can be attached) is terrible. The clip ends as a simple entertainment journalist who tries at all costs to have airtime, a guy who says he is a witness and who hopes to be able to get on television, while soldiers and paramedics paramedics shouted "because". The clip does not capture any of the dramas of such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it, you should do it, that is, unless you are conservative, in which case you 'better stay outside because you might be offense. But if you are not, you might know how many of us outside the United States lived on September 11th.
