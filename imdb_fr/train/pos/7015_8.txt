Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who virtually gives the store to everyone's surprise. What type of IRS agent is it? <br /> <br /> Most of us have all heard the statement from an IRS agent: "Hello, I'm from the IRS, I'm here to help you." Our smile then spreads in a laugh that says, "Yeah, that's it." <br /> <br /> As you advance in this story, you can not understand this guy. It goes smoothly on those who are audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich man who wants to do good? It helps so much that we want it to become our listener if we have to be audited, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (I laugh, I laugh) <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film is perfect and so much that clues were ignored that could tell me what was really happening. Intense, repeat intense, focus on Ben and stay there. The whole movie only works because of Ben, as we try to understand him and I have not seen any clues (what clues are you talking about, Willis?). Not reading the box before watching the movie on DVD was the best way to get there. At the end of the film, I finally put everything in place. Well, it was obvious by then. And, yes, it's exaggerated, but it's still a beautiful story, especially because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should have been nominated for Best Actor. The rest of the cast was very good too. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's exaggerated and despite the acting quality of the actors, and when you finally get all the answers, you have to understand that the movie's message is totally wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you will not need too many clues to understand it. I do not have <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing exciting. Bland. Nudity: No Language: No
