The movie was ok, quite fun. The cast was pretty good, and I share what the comment before me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was exceptional and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He brilliantly played the "mean" selfish friend and the group manager! <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but it's not really a surprise if you consider the movie is a VH1 production. However, if the soft rock / pop music is not suitable for someone, we could also advance these scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot of a group trying to climb to the top in LA but who has to overcome many obstacles on the way are not too original, but rather fun, with a surprising plot here and there.
