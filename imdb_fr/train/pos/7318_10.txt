John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is it the greatest horror movie of all time? no .. maybe not everyone, but for me it is and always will be. The film is pure genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that I did not see this film for twenty years before its release, but even twenty years later, after the passage of so many cute cats, the film always had the same impact. must have done then. Before going to Halloween H20, my dad suggested I rent and rent Halloween numbers 1 and 2 to get the whole story. After watching Halloween, it was clear that the genre Slasher was defined and defined. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is simple: in 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a big butcher's knife. Incarcerated for fifteen years, where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, where he begins to hunt down three young girls: Laurie Strode, an innocent library rat, Annie Brackett, an sarcastic who speaks loudly, and Lynda Van Der Klok, a beautiful and sexually vigorous girl. Dr. Loomis follows Michael here where he seeks help from city sheriff Leigh Brackett, who remains skeptical about his story about the psychotic murderer. Michael watches the girls ruthlessly and starts killing them one by one, until only sweet innocent Laurie remains, who is the main target of Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The cast of this film was brilliant, as well as all the actors and actresses gave prominent performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was gorgeous in her first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave an exciting performance with his small role of Loomis. Nick Castle, who portrays Michael as a soulless and perverse murderer, has done a remarkable job. His walking and body movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the highlights of this film is its scary score directed by John Carpenter himself. who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. The Blue Lighting was scary and effective and one of the highlights of this film is when young Laurie huddles against a wall after seeing her dead friends and in the shadow behind her face, Michael's face materializes before he hits. Michael's mask was one of the things that gave me the most shivers in the back, the white face, without emotion, worked perfectly. What makes this film so great is that it's not a bloody film, unlike the one on Friday 13th movies, in fact there is very little blood in this film and works rather on the suspense and tension . <br /> <br /> It became so clear that Halloween gave birth to movies like Friday the 13th and to characters like Jason Voorhees, whom he is the scam of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I suggest that you see this film at least once in your life because it is a landmark event in the making of a movie. Without a doubt, if not the greatest, it is one of the greatest horror movies of all time.
