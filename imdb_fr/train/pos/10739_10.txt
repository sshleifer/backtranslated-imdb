Incredible documentary. I have seen it in original date and on DVD a few times in recent years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary in 2002, the year he was released. No other documentary approaches it. <br /> <br /> It was on TV recently for the 5th birthday, but I missed adding the segment "where are they now" at the end, except for the fact that I I understood that it was now working in the hazardous materials unit. <br /> <br /> I have seen critics of documentary making among some of the people on this list. I do not see how it could have been done differently. They had less than 6 months to assemble this and get it on the air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother has not conducted any projects in the last four years. What did they do?
