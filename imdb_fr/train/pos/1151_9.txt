"Soapdish" is one of the best comedies of the 1990s, but the least memorable. The film revolves around the various off-camera dramas that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced Daytime Soap Opera. The first of the impressive strengths of the film is its fantastic cast of A-List. "Soapdish" presents some of the greatest actors and actresses of his time. <br /> <br /> The film is superbly directed by Sally Field, as the aging neurotic actress Celeste Talbert makes it look like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!"). His cast reads like one who's who's Movie Greats from the 90s! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Hatcher Teri, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy greatly raise the film. As expected, Goldberg is excellent, while the performances of Downey Jr. and Hatcher suggest the comic excellence they would get afterwards. <br /> <br /> The film is remarkable in terms of writing. The scenario has a truly modern look, which goes on several times in the wonderful. There are also several visual gags ahead of their time. In some ways, the film recalls Mel Brooks at his best and often reminds this author of "High Anxiety" (1977). Much of the film's humor is based on often scathing but fairly precise depictions of daytime television and neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, the extras casting session featuring Carrie Fisher's exploiting director is both hilarious and honest. <br /> <br /> "Soapdish" is, for my money, one of the best comedies produced in Hollywood in the 1990s. It's an excellent script and the A-Class distribution makes it a must. It's hard not to like this movie after making it laugh for 90 minutes.
