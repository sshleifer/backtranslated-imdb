I saw this film the day it was released last year. Hilarious I thought. Well, now it's on the video and I saw it again. I love that movie! The things they do are sometimes stupid but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are acceptable, but the spiritual dialogue will make you roll. I'm the kind of person who will say that I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like drama and stuff, avoid it. But for all the others, enjoy! The acting is superb. Hank Azaria is undoubtedly the best (he is neither a clerk nor a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (uh, do not correct me, it makes me sick) then William H. Macy delivering his best performance (fargo fulgurant) Everyone has congratulated everyone from macy to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as an Invisible Boy. Two Problems: The most boring part of the film is the secondary plot of romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and Casanova's parole hearing. Some scenes do not really advance the story, but they are great. Kinka and especially the writers tend to hang out on a stage until all that is hilarity is gone, but bam they change and you are ready for more. I swear that after seeing this, you will be tired by the explosive climax (which, I think, was pretty cool). The camera is also very cool, moving at a fast pace with the actors. In addition, Tom Waits offers an outstanding performance (he has that cold cool hero) and, as someone said, the best moments are those where the characters are human. Captain Amazing is quite funny (especially his talk to Casanova about his perfect shot - I was riding) and rush is pretty cool like Casanova. An ox: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost lost, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, a wonderful movie. I give him twenty stars and I hope that one day everyone will see the brilliance of the best parody of the film, that of Six Million Dollar Man. Laughing now that I think about it. 20/10
