How I started: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I must say that I have never seen anything like it and that it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS, and years later on DVD, part of Bandai's Anime Legends collections. It was amazing, and really deserves to be watched. There have been a lot of explosive actions that will make you lose your head. And of course, the themes "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions "were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the series were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Thirteen, Lady. Noin and Zechs: My favorite Gundams in the series I most loved are Wing Zero, Epyon and, of course, Altron, and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> Significance of the show: What this series also tells us that in real life, wars are very difficult and that we can sometimes win or lose, but peace can also be difficult to obtain, and I believe that the Gundam pilots do what is right and try to get peace in the world. <br /> <br /> But as this show is really the best of the best, so to conclude, after watching this show, watch Movie Endless Waltz.
