If you've ever wondered why they do not make porn with a plot, look at Dream Quest. On the one hand, you must recognize that Armstrong's efforts have been leveraged to exploit this idea and that you have used such a powerful cast of adults to empower a name. On the other hand, we quickly understand why most porn never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue to link sex scenes. These people simply can not act (and the story is unfortunately ridiculous to a ridiculous degree). <br /> <br /> However, I gave a 7 because it was a good attempt and there did not seem to be much. an effort to cut corners. Also, I would like to see more attempts like this. Maybe someday I'll see the perfect combination of porn and plot.
