I saw this film for the first time during my drama and drama class at Tulane. I was impressed by the beauty and brutality of this documentary. It is a sincere look at the unprecedented reality of a life of loneliness. The family is fascinating and I thought that really showed little Edie at his base. ** As a side note, my teacher even told me that throughout the filming, Little Edie was infatuated with one of the cameramen. ** The beauty, I think, comes from the natural dysfunction of the family. It is clear in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither can work in society alone and that you begin to want Little Edie's reintegration into society. In total, the film seduces with its aesthetic quality and its surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!
