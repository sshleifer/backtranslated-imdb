The dehumanizing effect of war is a very studied subject in films; as well as the equally dehumanizing, yet potentially dehumanizing, effect of military training. The "Tigerland" Joel Schumacher follows the standard model. We see men treated like mud, but becoming soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their senior officers, and judgment is reserved as to whether such an extreme process can be considered justified. as well as the judgment on the merits of the war for which they are formed (typically, as here, in Vietnam). But "Tigerland" has an interesting aspect in centering its narrative on an arrogant dissident named Bozz (played remarkably well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power ultimately governs by consent and lack of consciousness among the powerless of their own complicity. . Around this character, a learned and captivating plot has been built, and it's also an advantage that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket", to name just one other film of the same type, lost its concentration once the finished action moved to Asia). Although it is not a film of a stunning originality, it is extremely well filmed and captivating: the best film of this director that I saw, and among the best of the kind.
