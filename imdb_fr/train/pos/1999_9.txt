Oliver! the musical is one of my favorites. The music, the characters, the story. Everything seems perfect. In this interpretation of the timeless classic novel transformed into a musical on stage, director Carol Reed brings to life the Broadway hit on movie screens. <br /> <br /> The transition from music to movie music is not easy. You must have the right voices, the right game, the right script and the good game. All the signs indicate yes for this piece. It almost seems like it was written for the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in old and merry England, where a boy named Oliver manages to get out of the orphanage. He then travels the country to London where he meets a group of juvenile delinquents, led by Dodger, the mediocre intelligent disciple. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older man who sells all the stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But all is not good for the city of London when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his tender girlfriend Nancy get tangled with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops and the law. The result is a wonderful story of love, affection and great music numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like musicals or not, listen to them and hum them all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art.
