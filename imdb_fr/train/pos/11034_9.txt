Eric Valette is obviously a talented filmmaker, as are the two people who wrote the screenplay. Maleficent is an excellent film, made with only a few dollars but also a lot of imagination. Well, I exaggerate a bit, but nevertheless I am sincere. So, if you like dark and gloomy movies, go see this one. It's really worth it.
