This Raggedy Ann and Andy movie is so adorable. We like to watch Ann and Andy sing and dance, as well as the camel's crumpled knees. This film is what made the camel knee wrinkled so popular, singing his song "I'm nothing that I love you". If you like Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch the movie and you'll see why it's a movie that kids love and adults love!
