There are many police dramas that go around. I'm not sure why. This is probably related to the old basic theme of good versus evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a raw recruit, into a police brigade stationed in the Baltic region. . No attempt is made to glorify the police. They are really down-to-earth, sometimes hard and ruthless, Anne on the other hand has a sweet heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against any rule, she sometimes retains incriminating information found in her strip searches and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a nice movie. Not one to relax. There is not a lot of optimism. The police seem to be involved in a losing battle. Tomorrow, there will be more scum, more killings, more family separations and more children in distress. Let's face it. This is the world in which we live. <br /> <br /> As the days go by, Anne becomes more closely involved in the police and the families she is investigating. The only real heat of the film is that of the character Benny, 12 years old and from a broken family. Anne has her own way of fixing things. She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help her as best she can. I was surprised, however, that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. I wondered if it took into account the father or his own needs. After all, the film clearly shows that she desperately needed a partner and loved her children.
