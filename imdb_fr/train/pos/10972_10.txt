I have only seen it recently, but I have been aware of it for a number of years and I have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very favorite movies. It's hard to describe the incredible topic Maysles discovered, but everything works perfectly. There are so many images and memorable moments in which you feel invaded a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and the characters that appear there. It's as if the filmmakers had cast a spell on the public and dragged us into the weird world of the eccentric Beales, a real aristocratic family. There is a tangible atmosphere and I thought I could be away from everything, cook my corncob at the bedside table. He has an air of sadness that permeates everything. A fall of greatness for this once-esteemed family. The money had disappeared, but their airs and graces remained, as did their beauty. This attracted me since the first image and long after the end of the film, I wondered about their fate. I was wondering if, if I walked along the East Hampton Beach, I would still hear old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of little Edie dancing at the window behind the thick hanging vine. . Unforgettable.
