"Stairway to Heaven" is an exceptional invention of film making, probably never duplicated. I classify it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although it's a totally different type of movie from "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects totally unique to my knowledge. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of black and white and color sequences, as in "Oz", but the importance of the contrast goes well beyond the simple - but beautiful - obtained in "Oz". In "Stairway", contrast and purpose can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of "Stairway" is the concept of "time" and its use here. How could anyone devise a better way to silence time? Literally? And then there is the staircase itself! <br /> <br /> If you have imagination, you will agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real gem.
