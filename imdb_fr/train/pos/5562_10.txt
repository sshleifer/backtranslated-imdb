This has the fun jokes of all Cheech & Chong movies. This is the first I saw with these guys. I thought it was really good. My dad recommended me to get it. WHAT A GREAT ROLE MODEL, and my GRANDMA bought it for me, knowing what it was like. Well, this movie is very good and good to rent when you want to see a good classic. I have to warn you though, it's not funny funny. He has his moments, but not as funny as there is something about Mary. Check anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless you're an anti-drug activist or something.
