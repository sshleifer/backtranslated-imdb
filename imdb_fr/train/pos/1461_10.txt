The film highlights the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - usually a woman - collecting images of the Chinese business owner who shares his unashamed and delusional view, his American counterpart also as shameless and delusional, the oppressed workers to whom a voice is given and, of course, drunken Americans who wear pearl necklaces unconsciously celebrating in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are outraged by the fact that the people who make their pearl necklaces were paid $ 0.10 an hour. You also have the feeling that workers can escape work in the pearl factory, but will probably do so when they get tired of the popular punitive treatment at the plant owner and / or are too tired to work. 20 hours a day of hard work. <br /> <br /> I wondered where these necklaces came from, not realizing how difficult and difficult it would be to make them. I have just really enjoyed this film that nicely describes the impact that American indulgence has on something we consider relatively harmless in our society for people on the other side of the world. An honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
