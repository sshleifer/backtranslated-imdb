Considering the lack of art with African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The Idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and resellers. But the funny thing is that it's not at all the focus or even the subject of the short film. But it is the undeclared affirmation of the independence of these themes which remains the most tenacious. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. It is almost this departure that catches the eye. To watch it twice is therefore essential. The film has an aesthetic quality that lends itself to the real art of cinema. <br /> <br /> And it is this true art that an African voice is extremely rare. The film does not copy to reach its message, it innovates and provokes by drawing on subtle stereotypes (no racial stereotypes but based on characters), From the point of view of the writers, the film is brilliant. It carries multiple messages that include a very fast character development. It must be remembered that this film lasts less than 10 minutes and manages to establish its character very quickly. The use of texture color and music should also be recommended. But considering the director, 500 years later, Owen Alik Shahadah, the music is to be expected. But from a thematic point of view, it seems that the idea is a departure, but the satire escapes indirectly to a social problem: a brilliant matter!
