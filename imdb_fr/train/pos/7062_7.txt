Deanna Durbin, Nan Gray and Barbara Read are among the "Three Smart Girls" of this 1936 Universal film, which introduces Deanna Durbin to the audience. He also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a beautiful story of three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who heard their father (Winninger) remarry. Having not seen him for 10 years and knowing that their mother still loves him, they board a ship heading for America, with the help of the housekeeper / housekeeper, resolved to end the marriage . Realizing that the intent, called "Precious" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they make sure she is introduced to a rich count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunkard (Auer), but the girls confuse him with a real rich chef (Milland). Such a waste. <br /> <br /> It's a charming film, not at all disgusting or too sweet, with some great performances, especially from Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. Young women are pretty and doing a good job. Of course, the focus is on young Durbin, a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer. In fact, her maiden voice is much more uniform than that of adult - she has no problem with high notes, as she did later because she put too much weight in her voice Central. She sings a delicious "Il Bacio" in a police station. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not wanting his children until he sees them. and get to know them. Barnes as a gold digger is not so young, but the girl's mother seems to be going very far, so the inference was probably the old man who was looking for his youth with a younger woman and more glamorous. In fact, he finds the youth he was looking for in his daughters. <br /> <br /> Universal gives Durbin the biggest star here - it has the last shot in the movie. At this point, Ray Milland was still paying his share, and it would be even a surprise to moviegoers how young and attractive he was. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, which of course led to a celebrity sequel to Deanna.
