The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sex comedy starring Ursula Andress, a former Bond Girl. Man was she hot in this movie .. She was stacked and built like a brick house * @ #%. Ursula was smoking hot in this movie. I have never seen such a complete nurse outfit. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Andress plays the role of a nurse who is hired to look after a rich old man. Even one in the house seems to break the feet. One night, the nurse decides to take the temperature of the grandson and gives some T.L.C. to his former client. The old man takes his nurse and this annoys the rest of the family. What kind of job did her family hire her? Will the geezer fall in love with her car supplier? How can she care for the octogenarian head and the rest of the family? To find out, you must find a copy of the SENSUOUS NURSE !! Italian but badly doubled in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
