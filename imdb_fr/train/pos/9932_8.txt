If you go into this movie hoping for something, you will be disappointed, as in any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as "iceberg effect". On the surface, it is simply a cache of random video clips that are assembled to form a movie. If it were to be written in a book, it would be news, because the action in the movie is very fast and, unless you really try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (with some subtle prefigurations) can very well going through. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice to fully appreciate. Experimental cinematography barely describes this film. Camera work and post-production add a lot to the film's overall flavor, making it quite artistic at times and open to interpretation for others (something to be desired in American films lately). Although, in some places, the film becomes a little shady, macabre and too heavy for some audiences, the film never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the film that I would call "need for improvement" is the selection of the soundtrack. A film is never good without a suitable soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite appropriate, the opening is a bit too long, and the other rap songs in the movie could really have been replaced by something more appropriate (heavy, dirty rock or psychedelic). electronica would have made this movie a real journey). The flood of images and dynamics ... the color palettes adds another "artistic" aspect, also combined with the events that occur throughout the film. It's not a movie you can miss and understand. However, this also makes it a more desirable movie, and you will not be bored quickly. 8.5 / 10
