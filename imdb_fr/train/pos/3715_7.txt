Well, it was a pretty sensitive little number, but I can not help thinking that I've seen it before. It reminds me of another VCA film I saw in Poitier and titled "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE" also had traces of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in her performance. Which does not mean that they are not tasteful references ... but just that they feel very modern and fashionable ... which gives me the impression that it is closer to advertising (as an approach to style and history) than the work of an original and authentic author to come. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply ... too perfect for my taste. Filter too coral (or charcoal) for my taste ... 12mm too framed. That's why all this impression left me a little far - beware of an art that proclaims too easily! The French (a conservative group) seemed to buy it, as did the jury however ... but the selection of Cannes short films is notoriously conservative compared to its selection of feature films, although I wonder what happened these last years.
