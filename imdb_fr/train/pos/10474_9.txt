I was incredibly impressed by this movie. It contained basic elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams and fellowship. It was not just a musician of genius that hit the bottom, but a man who was in pain and was trying to find solace in his music. He finds a companion who comes with his own problems. Claire and Des were able to bond friendship and love, but especially to conclude the events that had marked their lives for the worse. <br /> <br /> Des is an improbable character according to the current standards of the rock star. Yet he has a musical genius. He also had an event in his past that made him stagnate, while the things around him are literally in ruins. His main goal is to create his whale music. In fact, it becomes an obsession for him. <br /> <br /> Claire is the street child who needs a place to live. She finds hidden talents by being in the company of. She also finds a mutual friend who accepts it. She learned to trust him for a while. <br /> <br /> These two find love with each other. It's not a kind of passion that inspires sex, but a love where friendship and understanding mean more. Two injured people find trust together.
