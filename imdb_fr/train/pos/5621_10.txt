Sweet, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something huge. In front of and behind the camera, he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces I have had the pleasure of seeing, seeing and seeing again. He never let me down. People, even those who know me well enough, thought / thought something was wrong with me, based on my appeal, or should I say, devotion to "The Tenant". They may be right, I do not know but there is something irresistibly captivating in the darkness of Polanski and I have not even mentioned humor. The mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that invades and, of course, us. This building is home to former Oscar winners Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet and Lila Kedrova. For those who like movies, this is mandatory. One, two, three, many, many views.
