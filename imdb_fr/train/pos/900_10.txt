This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way. This film is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more films or movies like this to preserve the South Asian culture. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao played this role very well. Their couple also attracts a lot of people to the cinema. It is a must-see film, it is a family film and romantic. This film is also creators of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This film is their best right now ... the film frame was beautiful which is also a huge attraction. This film is to see ... recommended to all!
