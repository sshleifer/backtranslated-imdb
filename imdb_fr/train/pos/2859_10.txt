I know it sounds strange coming from a person born almost 15 years after the end of the series, but I love this series. I do not know why, but I like to watch that. I like Adam the best. The only thing that is disappointing is that the only place I found to buy the seasons on DVD was in Germany, and it was only the first two seasons. It's disappointing, but it's okay. I will continue to search online. If anyone has any advice on where to buy seasons 2-14, email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have the first one. The only drawback is that since the DVDs are German, they are only played on my portable DVD player and my computer. Never mind. I still have it!
