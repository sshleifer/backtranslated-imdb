I love it when they tell a sports story. So many people in the past have been so hokey that it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a really cool movie, a kind of old-fashioned story - and based on a real-life guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays the role of a high school coach trying to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Finally, he achieved his goal of going to the major leagues, even if it was a very brief passage. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are nice people, the kind you're looking for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a kind of star to television.) <br /> <br /> We can believe that Quaid plays Jim Morris because unlike the sports actors of the past movies, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could pull him over 90 miles per hour. And most of this film is true, as evidenced by the real pitcher of one of the DVD documentaries. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for an inspiring and inspiring sports film in real life, you can not go wrong with this one.
