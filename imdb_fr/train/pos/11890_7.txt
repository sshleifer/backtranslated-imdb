It's a pretty dull movie. Well shot with realistic performances, in particular a very good film of Depardieu as a ruthless boy with realistic places and artistic connotations, he fails because the director does not adopt any position, position statement or criticism on the subject that he states. One of France's revered partners and accustomed to films with Depardieu - I think they made 7 together - Pialat can not make a commitment. This seems to be a treatise on why women fall under the spell of the bad boy who will suffer when they have a caring boyfriend and a big-hearted husband. Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with a nonchalant distinction offers contempt responses of the type "I do not know"; "I like his arms"; "I love the way he makes love" to her questioning husband who tries to drive her out of the house, but who pales and questions herself because ... I guess he loves her. So he accepts and hopes what? May she wake up one day and come to her senses. The condescending docu-dramatic style of Pialat does not respond to such things, with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add up. I know the answers do not match, but please take a position. Jules and Jim, it's not. The last shot as cold as the film we have just seen is a heartache and a headache reserved for the most indulgent.
