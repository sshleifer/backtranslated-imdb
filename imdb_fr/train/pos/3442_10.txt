This film lets the intellectual mind think and try to analyze the story. I too can not understand why people would make fun of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie might not be right for you. <br /> <br /> This film presents a high degree of realism. The performance of actors and actresses is exemplary. Not fake, just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effect, so special side effects. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is excellent, the music is so good. I can not wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This leaves your body numb, like Constant Garderner.He has a direct raw talent, certainly not a disciple.
