The first and only time I saw this woman in black was the only time I knew she had appeared on television in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my father and I were looking at her in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time but I'm not sure who was more terrified walking in the church yard to the entrance of the church that night, me or my father! . <br /> <br /> There are many factors about it A movie that makes it so scary, but I think one of them is the fact that there are not many sound tracks that play in the background in almost every Hollywood movie; as there is no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories is that there is no jumping factor involved like bouncing things in the closet, so that does not necessarily make what you see but what you hear and what you think is happening. It's an intelligent way, because nothing scares you more than your own mind that does not think about the corner or the door! <br /> <br /> A great ghost story, I've never seen anything that fits that and with all the slags that are repeated over and over on TV, I can not believe that the BBC l deleted after (to my knowledge) a single broadcast!
