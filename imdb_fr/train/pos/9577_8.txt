Finally, we have in front of us a category III film for the summer season 2006. Made equally of cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog does not only benefit from an appropriate title, but also from a flexible direction , a superb cinematography and respectable performances by most people involved. Of course, there must be a trap, which manifests itself here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies, but DBD represents the mature mind that we would like to see more in the main stream of HK. <br /> <br /> marks the announced return of Edison Chen, long absent since the debacle of Initial D a year ago. Chen's reserved machismo does wonders for the film, but would have been tough without the other vis-Ã -vis Sam Lee, whose talent for alternating between physical comedy (Crazy 'N' the City, No Problem 2) and the whimsical threat culminated in the most powerful role we have seen from him since Made in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Together, the Dog Bite Dog duo builds, and we hope that Edison will now have an easier break: her contact has transformed Princess D's projects into the Infernal Affairs saga, and there's always an event rare. <br /> <br /> DBD presents mostly mesmerizing images at first, playing superb tricks with light, shadow and perspective. The soundtrack reinforces this atmospheric effect, adding to the overall unreal atmosphere of the film. The resulting combination is probably due in large part to the writer Matt Chow, previously engaged in the same appalling Three Extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains many reminiscent features of this horror project, namely collapsed cityscapes and an ubiquitous air of something strange that hides around the corner. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, this is not a horror movie, but rather a trail previously borrowed from the classic One Nite in Mongkok, albeit from a more perverse angle. By replacing Daniel Wu's reluctant assassin character on the mainland, we have Edison, who plays an unnamed killing machine from the Cambodian underworld. Sent to Hong Kong to execute a single target, the almost silent assassin deals with the business as soon as he arrives, a process described with coolness thanks to the brilliant visual effects of the film. <br /> <br /> Although weaned from childhood to become a killer professional, Edison's eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trace, picked up by a CID team sent to investigate. This assembly features a friendly comrade of the loyal Lam-Suet, a film supporting the crowd, as well as good support from television star Wayne Lai. However, Sam Lee's rebel officer Wai leads the indictment and turns out to be an extremely disturbed individual, but nonetheless an excellent cop. We gradually learn that Wai's inner conflict stems from police corruption in his father, evoking useful demons in the implacable pursuit that follows. <br /> <br /> A small number of corpses occurs, as Edison seems to consider taking prisoners as a no-no. . There is quite a quotient of violence to come, even if Gore feels locally weakened, and adult language is only symbolic. Once again, no nudity, which leads him to conclude that the Cat III were handed a little faster. Nevertheless, DBD is a relatively mature theatrical release and we applaud his arrival. <br /> <br /> Between fighting, stabbing, hacking and shooting, even a career murderer needs romance, and just as Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, the intrepid Mr. Chen receives a gift of heart, beautifully made by the newcomer Pei Pei. His anonymous character (a lot of anonymity in this one) meets Edison in a strangely deserted dump, abused by his father until the repulsive madness and the desire to escape. When the killer abandons HK, he agrees to take him with him and they run off together, they love to bloom along the way. Although the film does not dwell on the lovey-dovey stories, our heart goes to the tragic character of Pei Pei and his endless suffering. It makes the shy but stalwart protagonist incredibly good, claiming that there are no good guys or bad guys here, as reflected in the sobering finale. <br /> <br /> Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes the recent thriller thriller Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two figures surpassed in most accounts by the sinister behavior of Dog Bite Dog. Cheang manages to keep DBD afloat, and given the many pieces at play here, he stands up to the critical standards set by people like Johnny To in his "The Mission" night epic. Some problems arise, like Edison who miraculously shrugged his shoulders, but these are highly forgivable. <br /> <br /> The big triumph is for two talented young performers of the kind that Hong Kong needs if we want the city's bright days to come back, Dog Bite Dog does not stand out for history. Its strength lies in its strong representations and style, carried by the strength of the espian muscle and by an attentive eye for visual and auditory finesse. <br /> <br /> HK has a long history of stories related to the city's alter-ego nightlife, something that Dog Bite Dog defends with love, constituting a solid race or even a true leader. artwork. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
