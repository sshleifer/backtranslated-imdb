Yes, I sat here, red-faced, remembering feeling almost guilty for watching her a few weeks ago when my wife chose to look at something as inconsequential (in comparison) as " Mommie Dearest ". <br /> <br /> How to explain the attraction of "Batman and Robin"? I'm talking about the only ones who really counted, Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a dreadful show, with intrigues and terrible roles - and, oh yes, it was terribly funny! And it's the same for this movie "reunion" and "flashback". Adam and Burt are invited to an auction at which the old Batmobile will be sold for charitable purposes. But he gets robbed, and our buddies (like themselves) jump into the characters of their old characters (if not their costumes) and head to find out what happened. Along the way, they remember the series and we see how it all happened in flashbacks, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing the young Adam and Burt of the TV series. It was really interesting to have some backstage footage from the old series, and Adam and Burt come back to the character perfectly (even if they were not really in the character - well, you'd have to look at it to see what I I mean, it was nice to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin again. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you will hate this. If - God forbid - you really thought that Michael Keaton and George Clooney had made Batmans acceptable, then you would hate it even more. But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and you're always ready to admit that you've never missed an episode - well, this one is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right - 9/10
