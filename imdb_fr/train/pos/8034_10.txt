There are few films that seem to offer both realism and entertainment. If you've ever wondered what the role of snipers is in modern war, take a look at this one. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene in which a hundred soldiers shoot in the jungle, nobody really knows where this shot comes from? <br /> <br /> And they stole a scene to save the soldier Ryan so he must have merit in the scene. <br /> <br />
