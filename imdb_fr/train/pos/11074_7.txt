Neither the total disaster, according to British critics, nor the misunderstood masterpiece that his few fanboys insist on, Revolver is at least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his con artists. But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites much more than it can chew, especially a movie using the frame of a gangster / crook movie. As one might expect from the name of Luc Besson in the credits as a producer, there is a certain element of 'Cinema of Look' about it: located in a sort of fantastic fantasy world where America and the Great Britain are overlapping, it looks great, has action sequences and style inspired and designed, which characterize it as a one-time entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than just rehearse his own movies for a quick dollar, and he has spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. The problem is that he tries to create too many influences (a little Machiavelli, a touch of Godard, many principles of chess), patterns and techniques that litter the screen of quotes: the film was originally intended to finish with three minutes of epigrams on pictures of dead mafia victims, and sometimes he has the impression that he never reads a fortune cookie that he did not want turn into a movie. Rather than an advertisement for kabbalism, it is in fact a mixture of overlapping principles of commerce, chess and cunning of trust, which essentially leads to the difficult task of making theosophy accessible while hiding the central (somewhat metaphysical) problem of the film. The last third is where most of the problems come together as Jason Statham attacks (literally) the enemy with a lot of ambitious crossovers but not always successful in the frame to contrast the people's bravado with their inner fear and anger, but there is plenty to do for all the same. It's not worth it to start a new religion again, but I'm surprised it did not have an American distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's artificial tan too scary?
