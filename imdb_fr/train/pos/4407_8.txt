For those who commented on The Patriot as being correct, (which fundamentally satanized English), it was interesting to see this movie. By all accounts, it was the bloodiest war the Americans were involved in, and it was the only nationality present. So it was very refreshing to see something similar to the historical precision coming from this side of the Atlantic that does not describe America as a martyr or a savior. Overall, this film has revealed the horrors of all conflict and the way in which acts committed in war only lead to worse acts, often leading to the suffering of the innocent. This is not a movie where you applaud anyone, but complains and hates everyone.
