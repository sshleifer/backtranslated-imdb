This cordial comedy confronts some weird characters. Especially, of course, the two main characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she could no longer stand his cleaning and cooking attacks. So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, unreliable and unreliable sports journalist, who is living in divorce with his ex-wife in a studio. He offers his distressed friend Felix a new house in his apartment. And soon the problem starts because two of these opposite characters can not live together for a long time. Felix transforms Oscar's messy apartment into a clean show apartment. He cleans and cooks all the time. After a short while, Oscar feels the mania of the persecution ... Theatrically filmed and excellent actor. Above all, Jack Lemmon's play is magnificent. He is the perfect clown. He makes us laugh but in a tragi-comic way. Look for the wonderful scene where the two men invite their two neighbors to dinner, because Oscar must touch something softer than the bowling ball. While he prepares the drinks, Felix sits down with the two girls in the living room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he starts talking about the weather. A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and his children. He suddenly starts to cry and when Oscar comes back with drinks, there are three crying people in the living room. The film is full of scenes that are both funny and touching. An intelligent and entertaining comedy with a lot of heart. 10 of 10!
