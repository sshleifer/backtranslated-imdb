Well, when before seeing this movie, I was really not sure it was my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best movies I've watched for a long time, a true family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new father "home", this film meets all the conditions. I did not read the book (it may be a good thing and it meant I liked the movie more), but as far as the story goes, I really can not think of any negative points . So I rated it 10 out of 10 (and hardly ever think that anything deserves the best ratings!). By the time William proclaimed "I CAN GO MY BIKE, DAD! I sobbed my heart (whoever saw this will understand, I'm sure). Really comforting and definitely recommended.
