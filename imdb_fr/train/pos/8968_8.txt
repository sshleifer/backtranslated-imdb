This film was like any Jimmy Stewart movie, witty, charming and very enjoyable. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who aspires to be human, is splendid, her subtle facial expressions, her different gestures and gestures create the bewitching character, she let us hang on to each of her words. I will not fail to mention the highly commendable performances of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester as a scotch-loving scotch-obsessed writer (Kovacs) and as a kind aunt Romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully finished and the chemistry that unites them is great, but when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and a leading woman is bad!
