How can one claim that Urban Cowboy is and remains the best document of life in Texas for the time? Consider the following: Men beat their wives, get drunk in bars at night, marry to settle a conflict, commit adultery and compete for mechanical bulls. Try to name a movie that describes real life so vividly. They do not do them anymore. It seems that today's movies always talk about people who have a lot of money, live in gigantic houses, drive expensive cars and do not work. This movie has a celebratory scene about getting a trailer for Pete's sake! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watch it at least once a week. No kidding. I dissected this film from beginning to end. feel free to email me to find out more about why I called it a documentary. Consider the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are divided - he honks amicably and gestures him back, he returns half the peace sign honking to add impact and then tears. Mom's buds call her about. 18 hours after arriving in town on a Sunday, to see if he still has a job - all he's done is get drunk and get laid (x2), with the help his uncle and aunt cover him. <br /> <br /> "You all live like pigs" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary? Could not we solve it without showing the dirty sink? God I like that! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows Wes to help him ride the bull. Only a few days (or maybe the next day) after Wes just shit the shit. Steve asks - Hi Sissy, do you remember Wes? Oh yes, you did not beat my husband the other night, so let's move on to this lesson, to say nothing of the fact that she's trying to comfort herself later on during the many fights of Bud and Sissy, who Elsewhere are in public - at Gilley's! <br /> <br /> The shooting session of wedding receptions (oh humanity!) could at least arrange or move the chairs away. "My legs sweat, mom" <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you do not put scenes like this in a movie to try to make you understand human psychology. It's a real life documentary. <br /> <br /> I only wish there was a director's cut ....
