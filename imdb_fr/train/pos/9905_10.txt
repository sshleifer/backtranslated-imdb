I lost count of the number of reviews I wrote about Slaughter High. I read a lot of bad and I will say right now that it is a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore became known in no time for his well-known suicide, and even though it was his only film, he is what made this film so great. At first, I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review of his suicide. Then I discovered because of the current web page on www.IMDb.com, he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon may have played the most pathetic character that man knows, but his real life certainly had its strengths and weaknesses. He did a good job as an actor, who may not agree? I always wondered how he felt being naked in a movie. It must have been embarrassing enough to say the least. I saw this film for the first time at the age of 12 in sixth grade. I agree with some indicators, as if the girl did not bathe after the murder of someone and secondary schools do NOT have bathtubs! I think Caroline Munro, then 36, was the only other star to have a worthy acting talent and, unfortunately, for Simon's death, he did not shoot any movies. The reasons for his suicide are a mystery and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. Do the math on his webpage, he tells you that he was 29 when he did Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this film twice, the best horror film made. Probably because of their horrible acting, others have not made themselves known in the world of cinema. -Jacob Young
