A sometimes surreal thriller that will push the buttons of most people., The 4th man will surely shock all those who have the taste of politically correct. The protagonist of the story is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), endowed with a seriously twisted sense of imagination. Verhoeven offers until <br /> <br /> Gerard has an example of everything that is wrong with the modern man. He is decentered, illusory, unable to control his desires, fears to engage in meaningful and totally apathetic relationships about life in general. As the character himself claims at one point, he is a professional liar, unable to recall the truth. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gerard dreaming that spiders eat Christ, then wake up to begin the long march towards his own destruction. He hunts <br /> <br /> a man (probably a boyfriend), then chases another in a station. Later, at a conference, he meets a woman who seems to want to help her, or maybe she has more harmful plans. She quickly captures Gerard in his web, attracting her with sex and money, having a lot of both. She also has <br /> secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she alone and is she really looking for someone to feed - or is she a deadly black widow, drawing Gerard to his death <br /> <br />? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills? The woman's name is Christine (Soutendijk) and Verhoeven does her best to let you guess what she's doing. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting movie, with lots of sex and intrigue. It looks like Verhoeven's <em> Basic instinct </ em>, but it's much deeper and certainly more shocking. There is a lot of very strong gay content, which can hurt the viewers. Highly recommended for fans of intelligent psychological thrillers, or for anyone looking for something totally new.
