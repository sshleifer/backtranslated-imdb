This film stands out from the vast majority of romantic movie comedies. It's almost flawless! Writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is captivating and ravishing! <br /> <br /> Each character is singularly charming and memorable, roles played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, through the many minor roles - - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even a great- father with his dog pack! Each of these artists, as well as Norman Jewison as director, play above their normal quality in this overall work. For many of the actors, it was an important exhibition at the beginning of the film. The casting is exceptional - and we have many current actors whose career has been changed by their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film several times throughout - which can sometimes dramatically reduce the impact of a film. More telling, I realized a few years ago that every time I surfed a channel of this movie - whatever its scene - the scene was fascinating and beautifully designed. There are so many amazing and memorable scenes from the original encounter between Cher's characters and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his story of misfortune; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his opera lover, among the splendor generated by his plumbing business in a gold mine; Olympia Dukakis criticizing John Mahoney for exchanging ideas with his student in the classic discourse on liaisons with colleagues: "Do not do what you eat!"; Danny Aiello at the bedside of his dying mother; Nicolas Cage "taking" Dear as the removal of an air goes up in the background! <br /> <br /> There are of course many great romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially the original Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When Harry meets Sally; The apartment. <br /> <br /> No equal to all Moonstruck!
