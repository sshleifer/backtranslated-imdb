The three main characters are very well portrayed, including Anisio by the rock musician turned novice actor, Paulo Miklos. He is extremely convincing as an intruder / invader of the lower class. The film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in increasingly dubious business, contrast and similarities between the lower and upper classes. How everyone is carried away by greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10
