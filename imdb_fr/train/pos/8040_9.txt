It will be a little short. First of all, do not listen to critics, it's not as bad as most people say !! Sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many immediately consider a flaw of the film. Although the sniper does not fully reflect the truth about the operation of the military snipers of our country, it does not give an insight into the world of the professional sniper professional sniper. And yes, the film has a lot of flaws, but what movie does not? There are many good scenes and good actors from Tom Berenger. I must say that the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the film with Billy Zane in the helicopter, followed by Zane in the Navy bar. The best scene of Sniper is that of BÃ©renger in the middle of a field swept by the opposing force !! There are also many good jungle shots and classic shots using the camera as if you were looking through a telescope. And yes, the slogan is "One Shot, One Kill". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
