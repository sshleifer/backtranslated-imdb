A film that staged an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable return of the Second World War, when a Spanish Republican, sent by his government that was going to be overthrown, (Charles Boyer) infiltrates England seeking support from its cause in trying to encourage the rich owners of mines not to sell coal to the fascists of Spain. It disrupts the local population, being beaten convincingly in a scene and, later in the film, facing an angry mob of miners who see it as an additional threat to their fragile livelihood. Despite the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film expertly plunges into a dark and suspenseful plot involving unfaithful compatriots interpreted by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre. Howe, and manages to get under the skin more than once.
