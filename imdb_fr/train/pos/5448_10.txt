This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the cast is amazing and the movie is really funny. A definitive satire of horror movies, with a zany twist. If you enjoy an entertaining and comical night, then rent this classic. You will laugh all the way!
