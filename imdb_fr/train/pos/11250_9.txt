After seeing the A Perfect Spy series all at once, you can only pull off your cap - a pure masterpiece that, compared to other minis in Le Carré sur Smiley, has very different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the minis on Smiley, it's Alex Guiness, like Smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him, we can say. <br /> <br /> Here, it is the set and the story that is important, as the main actor, excellently interpreted by Peter Egan in the last episodes, is not at all charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan just plays a guy called Magnus Pym who, lying, being sneaky and telling people what they like to hear, is very popular with everyone, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner being is Alex, his Czech handler. <br /> <br /> Never has the machine behind a spy and / or a traitor been better known! After following his life from an early age, we fully understand what makes him a traitor. His ability to lie and simulate everything makes him a "perfect spy," as his Czech master calls him. <br /> <br /> And by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back on the right path once you've deviated. He persists, even if he never gets anything economic except the promotion of his spy spies MI5. Everyone is happy, as long as the flow of fictional information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus' father, played brilliantly by Ray McAnally, is a dishonest rascal, who always dreams of stratagems to get people out of their money. In the following years, it is his son who must bailing him again and again. But like his father and uncle, who takes over when his father goes to jail and his mother is sent back to an asylum, Magnus quickly learns that lying is the way to survive and not to tell the truth. . At first he exaggerates a bit, but he quickly learns to say the right lies and to stay consistent, without changing the stories from time to time that he says to those who want to listen to himself and his father. <br /> <br /> His Czech coach Alex, expertly interpreted by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existent informants, who has been providing false information to British MI5 for years, such as The British spies active in the United Kingdom before and during the war continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been transferred, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. . <br /> <br /> the young guys who play Magnus in the younger years do it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, a little more cynical and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you easily buy the difference, because it's often how we evolve in life, from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifference. <br /> <br /> This is really worth it!
