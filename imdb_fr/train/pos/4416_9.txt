Harvey Keital's best performance so far for the new century. Very nicely photographed, a superb snapshot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local petty crime leader who develops a friendship with an American with links to Hollywood. This is really when a boy becomes aware that the small circle of people he knows lives in a much larger and more complex world that he does not yet understand. The scenario is powerful and humorous. is crispy Overall, a truly professional job that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The only weakness is the decision to shoot in synchronized English and not Spanish, probably to improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this makes the film a little less convincing. But if you can see beyond that, you will find a sincere journey into another world. Recommended.
