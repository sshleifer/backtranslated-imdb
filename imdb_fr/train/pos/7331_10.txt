In a time of magic, barbarians and demons abound in a diabolical tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliane, who lives in the realm of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire led by King Jerol, but when his beautiful daughter , Princess Teegra, was kidnapped. A warrior named Larn must protect her and defeat Nekhron from the conquest of the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf. <br /> <br /> A fantastic fantasy epic animated, well made and underrated that combines the actors live with an animation traced on them (rotoscopy). This is Ralph Bakshi's second best film, with "American Pop" number one, "Heavy Traffic" third and "Wizards" fourth. It's certainly better than its "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the work is designed by the famous artist Frank Farzetta and the animation has a nice color and there is also a hottie for guys. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to fans of fantasy and animation from around the world, especially the new Blue Underground 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD. <br /> <br /> We also recommend: "The Black Cauldron", "The Dark Crystal", "Conan The Barbarian". "," The Wizard of Oz "," Rock & Rule "," The Wizards "," Heavy Metal "," Starchaser: The Legend of Orin "," The Fantastic Planet "," The Princess Mononoke "," Nausicca : the Valley of the Wind "" Conan the Destroyer "," Willow "," The Married Princess "," The Lord of the Rings (1978) "," The Sword in the Stone "," Excalibur "," The Army of the Darkness "," Krull "," Dragon Heart "," King Arthur "," The Hobbit "," The Return of the King (1980) "," The Conquest "," The American Pop "," Jason and the Argonauts " , "The shock of the titans", "The last unicorn", "The secret of NIMH", "The flight of the dragons", "Hercules (Disney)", "Legend", "The Chronicles of Narnia", "Harry Potter and the Cup of Fire ".
