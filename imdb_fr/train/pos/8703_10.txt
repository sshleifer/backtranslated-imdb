I went in this movie after reading that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, transformed into a monster by society. Suffice to say that I was expecting something quite different from what I had. But it was a nice surprise. My friend and I thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the main male role is not bad to watch surely helped), and there was enough intrigue, action and even humor (The fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the film bearing the name of each one of them made all the cinema laugh) to entertain you and to invest you in history. In short: not what I expected, but a very pleasant surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
