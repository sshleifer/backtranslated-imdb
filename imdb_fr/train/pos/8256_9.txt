Saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and found it extremely intelligent, stylish and funny. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. An excellent job of Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Bill Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Oddly, I found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it. <BR /> <br /> Writers Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak, and Andrew Currie have been involved in a lot of political subtext - but they did not hit you in the head. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth, and made sense. There is a vertiginous carnivorous spirit in this film. <br /> <br /> It is guaranteed that FIDO will cure bad surprises. <br /> <br /> I loved it!
