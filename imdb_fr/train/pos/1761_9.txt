From time to time we only receive a R-rated comedy that attracts everyone's time and attention. This is an even rarer case when critics will like it. I just got back from The Virgin, 40, and I can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life. I went at 10:35 and each line was filled. Not only that, everyone laughed. It's two hours of non-stop laughter. I challenge you to see this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin. Yet behind this simple five-second joke, we're getting a complex and deep story that's not only one of the funniest you've ever seen, but contains real lessons. Steve Carell is performed by Andy Stitzer, The Virgin of 40 years. We have known Steve Carell, in my opinion as one of the best stage thieves of all time. Flying hilarious scenes from Bruce's all-powerful and particularly Anchorman, Steve Carell has come a long way, since finally, and proudly, he has time to shine as a star. Nobody will forget his name once he has witnessed this hilariously ridiculously amusing, heartbreaking and disturbing comedy. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie is that it's not 100% stupid. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell really makes sense and it's not a story to tell. Behind the rudeness and the vulgar way without stopping the film hides an important lesson to draw. Although not presented in the best possible way, the film offers us more than just a pleasant moment. His bewildering attitude will make you laugh all the time, while we will simultaneously see the real struggles in the lives of people like Andy and his colleagues. The end could not have been better. Not only does this give us what we have been promised, but it gives one of the most memorable numbers ever achieved by a comedy. It would have been perfect if there had been Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, but you can not win them all, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think, as Roger Ebert said, Catherine Keener gives an inexplicable perfect performance as Trish, the only woman for whom Andy really cares. Not only does she make us laugh, but it's crazy to see how much she feeds the story. Her role in the role is perfect and she and Carell have a hilarious chemistry on screen. Not to mention the hilarious chemistry. <br /> <br /> In terms of Canadian rankings, again, Ontario wins 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba all hit the 40-year-old Virgin with an 18A. The same thing happened with Four Brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more for it. To other American teens: good luck! <br /> <br /> Overall, Steve Carell gives one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and just about everyone in the distribution distributes bursts of laughter non-stop. Everyone will love the 40-year-old Virgin this summer and I encourage everyone to see her as soon as possible. It's the best comedy of the year, hands down. He beats everywhere in The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers, and of course in Anchorman, the last memorable comedy of Apatow and Carell. <br /> <br /> This is a cartoon masterpiece that deserves the remarkable praise from critics like that. Each of my favorite critics loved and deserves an immediate place on the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a huge star. Look at one of the brightest of the summer right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively ?? Subjectively <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
