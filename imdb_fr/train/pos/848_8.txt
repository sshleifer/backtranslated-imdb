The turn of "The Matador" comes about halfway through the film when Danny, an unsophisticated man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his Mexico City hotel and enjoys a moment of calm. Someone knocks on his door and, knowing that it is Julian, the paid murderer, he refuses to answer. But did he really do it? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, the director of "The Matador", presents a character, Julian Noble, who shows no redeemable quality. In fact, we have already seen it in action, doing what it does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real's bar in Mexico, he gets his fill and tells his new acquaintance what he's really doing with his life. <br /> <br /> Danny, who came to sell his program to a Mexican company, but it seems that he is competing with a local company that seems to be at the forefront to get the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls prey to the charisma and charm of the evil Julian. It is only a short time later, on a cold winter night, that the killer appears at Danny's door asking his friend to serve him and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this stage that the secret that unites them is revealed unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, acting against type, makes a great contribution to his irreverent Julian Noble. Just watching him walk through the hotel lobby with his Speedo and boots gives a good idea of ​​his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the right role in this strange couple. Hope Davis only appears in a few scenes, which leaves us regretting why she did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall plays the role of liaison between Julian and his tasks. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard conducts in style working with his own material. The score is by Rolfe Kent and the clean cinematography of David Tattersall improves everything.
