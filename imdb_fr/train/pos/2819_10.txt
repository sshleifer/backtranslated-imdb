This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! The "dragon lord" (Jacky Chan) and his buddy, "cowboy", have made the movie fun, meaningful and just silly. The film is a rare mix of a good fight against evil and (somehow) wonders and fun growing up. Long Shao Ye guides the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy", who understand the implementation of clever ways and designed to escape school (with the help of the whole house, including the tutor), arguing for rather juvenile (and silly, interesting) ways of gaining the affection of a girl from the region, participating in the "soccer" (you'll see what I mean) and the list is long. In one way or another, they find themselves in the middle of a battle to save a cargo of precious antiquities and the lives of many people. <br /> <br /> The film has its serious moments. But they do not depress but inspire. Boys' games are not lost in this exchange, but are actually used against evil. What I really liked in this film is the end. Not the typical confrontation (which in itself was great), but hey, you'll see. Let me just say that it really captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> silly, witty, full of meaning and nostalgic. super movie.
