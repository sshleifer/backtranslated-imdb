There are not many stories about the chances of overcoming that resemble those of Christy Brown. Born in Dublin in 1930, suffering from cerebral palsy, his parents thought that his disability was both mental and physical. Although ultimately correctly diagnosed, Brown, in a lower working class family of nearly 20 children, had to outdo himself to be appreciated by his family. Thanks to the use of his only limb, his left leg, which works perfectly, he learned to write and paint, skills that he developed with expertise. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography "My left foot" such a good story is his humility. Director / screenwriter Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have been able to tell this story in a way that does not scream for attention and uses melodrama. The cheesy fights and scenes of frustration as well as the glorious moments of victory are the easy traps of such a miraculous story, but "My left foot" remains real and intrinsically inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest way to highlight. Playing someone with such physical disabilities must be a demanding task. Not only does Day-Lewis give us a very complete picture of Christy, but he also manages to chronicle the growth, improvement and inner change of the character at different stages of his life. He played Christy at the age of 17 when he had limited language skills and was emotionally unstable, just as Christy, intellectually educated, struggles to understand why he does not find love not platonic. This last theme is the strongest of the film and it would have been nice for Sheridan and his co-adapter Shane Connaughton to clarify this. Anyway, Day-Lewis makes us understand and sympathize with all these elements, giving such a credible performance that you often do not have the time to think "wow, he's such a great actor". These are the most commendable performances. <br /> <br /> Sheridan's work on film is just as important, but in more subtle ways. This story deals with everyday life and struggles. Although Christy is struggling with such a peculiar set of circumstances, her struggles are reminiscent of ours and Sheridan takes hold of this concept. Christy struggles with love, parental attention, issues of self-confidence and ability. His struggles are simply more physically manifested (literally and figuratively) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the big Brown family and Christy's unique place in it. The drama evolves naturally when the tensions are the strongest and the humor presents itself in the same way. The dinner scene when Christy learns that her doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - is going to marry her brother Peter is the best example of the film depicting the efforts of Day-Lewis and Sheridan. Sheridan has built it so well that it appears when we are ready and Day-Lewis takes us with his amazing work. <br /> <br /> The other strong element of the film is Brenda Fricker as Madame. . Brown. I did not know she had won the Oscar, but there was something in her performances as a loving and wise mother of Christy who had just screamed worthy of an Oscar. His love for Christy and his relentless fighting for him seem so convincing and sincere that she deserves a lot of sympathy for her situation. <br /> <br /> The emotional impact of the film is surprisingly minimal. Maybe it was part of the sacrifice to try to create a movie that feels organically human. Both should be reconcilable, but I guess it's hard to tell a story that's true to reality, and that's enough dramatic moments to get our emotions rolling on a rollercoaster ride. The choice to minimize the latter was definitely the wise one for "My left foot". Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they do not have to be in a hurry to have a bigger dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site moviemusereviews.com for more information
