"The Lady from Shanghai" is well known as one of Hollywood's most troubled productions. The original cut of Welles was removed by the producers and cut in ribbons. This made it even more difficult to follow the already confused mystery story. They have posted a good deal of their dialogue because of the density of the Irish accent, and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly realized. The most disastrous of all, Welles and her screen and the real woman Rita Hayworth were falling apart in their relationship and their tumultuous chemistry shines on the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is overcome by the fantastic direction Orson Welles is. It makes the movie incredibly elegant and atmospheric - every scene just seems to breathe your back of the screen. In addition, the characters and scenes are so bizarre that they look like dreams and surreal dreams. This feeling of strangeness enhances the scenes that are often found in these films, such as the scenes of audience in the middle. I usually find the courtroom dramas boring, but the direction and unusual touches of Welles make them as fascinating as anything else. The end of the carnival is almost reminiscent of David Lynch's. <br /> <br /> The action here is also very good. Despite their failing relationship, Welles and Hayworth both perform well. Their interactions, however, are lacking a bit. Everyone is superb and fun to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Lady of Shanghai" obviously has its problems, but it's worth watching just to see one of the masters of cinema at its best. (8/10)
