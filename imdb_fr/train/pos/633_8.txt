Stardust Another Guarded Review (written on June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine is just starting for this one (there is still no site with?), So I doubt that most some of you have heard of it. In truth, I did not have either (somehow). When I got this review, I thought it was a different code name and I was worried it might be Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when I'm not working no, so I appreciate it 100% as a mere deadly viewer. It turned out that it was not Transformers and I was aware of it a long time ago when I was "Neil Gaiman's movie". What is it about? In short, it is a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. No more than that and I would give parcel information that is (a) a breach of contract and (b) ruin your pleasure. If you really want to know what it is, buy the book. Rumor has it that Gaiman could be a writer. <br /> <br /> Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so enjoyable if the surprise is worth it. And for this one, it certainly was. This projection was "special" in that it included not only film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed projection) and local people from science fiction and fantasy. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fairy tale written by a famous author in the world of comics. But it was not Lord of Rings. He was not even another aspirant of the Lord of the Rings (Erhem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that. <br /> <br /> But like the Lord of the Rings, it's the humanism of the film that sells the fantastic qualities. It is surely a romantic tale, but with generous touches of humor. And this humor is of the kind that is not a slacker Shrekism. It's more in the sense of comedy than comedy. Before continuing, let's do this movie review. <br /> <br /> Playing is, in any case, good. It's always hard to say more than that for fantastic movies, but I think there were some great roles played superbly. Michelle Pfieffer is unfortunately not one of these people. She plays a bad guy and she does the work. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, however, was a real idiot. He's a big bad guy. Peter O'Toole is, finally, Peter Frickin 'O'Toole - which is wonderful. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to have too much fun for most. When he wanted to deliver the goods, however, he did it. And Charlie Cox (who?) As the main character was a nice surprise to a guy I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I have always had mixed opinions with her. She can be great and then, she may seem to miss the goal. In this, she is the first. And she's literally the star of this movie. Of course, his accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when Cox is not in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are both dumb and accomplished, and only matter where they should be. Best Flying Ship To Date - Sorry Potter. The steering is light and flows well. Cinematography could have been better, but not everyone is filming in New Zealand. Everything else is in parentheses. <br /> <br /> And now, it's done ... <br /> <br /> ... writing. Oh, writing! Neil, you heck. In the current climate, it is difficult to do something original and, at first, one begins to marvel. A kingdom, a dying king, a boy who wants to prove his worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) - what's up? But Gaiman's story attracts you with its surface familiarity, but it subverts everything into an original and original story of a boy and his heart. And, although you suspect that everything was going to happen, you start asking questions in the third act and - if you are me - you are plunged into the culminating confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this movie, that's what all fairy tales should be, but it's not often the case. Fantastic and real. <br /> <br /> (I wish I could talk about Septimus against Tristan, but I will not spoil it.) For those who read this book, rest assured, it's done correctly.) <Br /> <br /> Those to whom I spoke later had the same impression as me. A great movie for all ages, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. White is filled only after the release of the movie, as you might expect. Either way, you'll know when you'll go out. I sincerely hope that Stardust will not get lost among the tents. Even if this is the case, I will be happy to put in the hands of all my contacts. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I forgot to add the developer {WITHHELD}. I'm a few years late, but ... "An excellent movie for all ages, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." <br /> <br /> Maybe a bit of a heavy evaluation, but I'm still convinced that in a few years there will be the same "Oh, I love this movie", as in The Princess Bride. .
