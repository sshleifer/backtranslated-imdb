I appreciate so much the sopranos for several reasons, one of its greatest triumphs was the construction of the cast and the character. Each character is revealed more and more each series. In addition, each series includes a table of different "small temporal characters", as well as the main ones. A good example of a character (which has only been in three episodes) for which you can feel is David, the compulsive gambler, played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect television series. The show revolves around mafia boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who tries to balance his life of crime with his role as a father of two. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and images and that's what makes it so credible. While Tony runs the capos with Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) is looking for a promotion. Each episode also features Tony's other family, including his children and his wife, Carmela Soprano (Edie Falco). In addition to these problems, her uncle Junior, the soprano (Dominic Chianese), tries to make the most of Tony's activities, even though he is under house arrest. All the actors are powerful and the characters complex, but the two that stand out the most are; James Gandolfini who is' Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher, representing the younger generation (20-30) in crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece, modern televised dramas of this caliber might not have existed, such as The Wire and Dexter. So, the Sopranos are definitely the Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp TV fiction
