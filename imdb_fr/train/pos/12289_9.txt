First of all, I would like to point out that I have not read the book, so there is no chance that I will be disappointed with this aspect. The major flaw that I spotted is the historical detail, with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I think I do not belong at that time. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler possible ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the film is ok, nothing to boast about. But playing, I think, was great. I have no experience in acting, but I still can not believe how terrible people can think of it! Maybe they only saw two movies (never), and the other one was really good! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons and I really understood his character, someone who climbed up the social ladder with a very hard job, then fights against those who would take away the work of his life; he alone is so involved in this fight, he does not realize that reason is no longer with him, and he ends up becoming a vanquished and disappointed man. The irons made it so credible, I sympathized with the character despite its brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young woman, attracted by revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (Banderas). he had an underdeveloped part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, but not up to the standards of other actors. Beware of Miguel Guilherme, a good Portuguese actor, among so many stars. <br /> <br /> Unlike today's movies, only interpretations, only people count, are not pretentious film, too worried trying to be intellectual. The best proof that I really liked, I write a review 7 years later.
