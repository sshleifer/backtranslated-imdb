Possible SPOILERS: Not sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I could not help but have mixed feelings about the whole movie. It's certainly a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But nothing in all this would give you the same kind of feeling as the Lion King. The story, for those who have not read the other reviews, deals with how Timon and Pumbaa meet and how they affect the events of the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> movie. My favorite part is when they show the pair raising Simba. However, for me, the worst moments must be when they show that Timon and Pumbaa interfere directly with the events of the original. I can never watch the "Circle of Life" or "Can you feel love tonight" sequences in the same way (I agree with the sequence "I can not wait to be king" ). <br /> <br /> The voices are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a great job, as does Matthew Broderick, the guy who makes Rafiki, and the hyenas. Even the actor who plays the young Simba seemed to me enough to Jonathon Taylor Thomas. But why did they even include a doubler for Zazu? He had literally only 2 lines, and none was very necessary. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add to the talent, although you still can not hear the voice of Timon's mother and do not think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Some scenes do not seem to correspond to reality. the original, the one that comes to mind when they are rock pride in the end. How did they have time to integrate into the initial fight with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD is concerned, you can not help thinking that for a set of 2 discs, special features are particularly lacking. They could have easily inserted a comment or other format report on the 1st disc. I enjoyed the game "Who Wants to be the King of the Jungle", even though it's the most shameful example of cross-promotion I've ever seen. Some of the questions are actually difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie, but not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
