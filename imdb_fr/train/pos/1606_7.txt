The "adult film" is a rare thing nowadays, but Moonstruck does it well and remains a better than average film, which is aging very well. Although his comic moments are aimed lower than the rest, the film has a wonderful specificity (the Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to dismiss characters or spectators. (That is, gangsters never show up in a complication - it never becomes grotesque as is the case with My Big Fat Greek Wedding) Secondary stories are told economically with short scenes that allow to break with the thread. These are the scenes that are now lacking in contemporary films, where their immediate value can not be impressed by producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It also magnificently involves older characters. The film takes its light and quiet way to its conclusion. No badly written scene appears anywhere to make certain leaders relax. Cage and Cher do a very good job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck invokes the old school, ethnicity and world of work in New York a bit like "Marty", unlike Moonstruck is a lot less pious.
