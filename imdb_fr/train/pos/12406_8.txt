A long-standing prison, closed for over 20 years, is reopened and Ethan Sharpe (the late, great lead actor Lane Smith), once a security guard, is set up as a guardian. While the prisoners are put to work to repair the premises, they are asked to enter the former execution room. This frees a fierce spirit that wreaks havoc on the guards and prisoners; Burke (Viggo Mortensen, a very discreet prisoner from the beginning) embodies the coolest prisoner in the world. <br /> <br /> I know it's obvious to praise the film for its atmosphere (it was shot in an abandoned penitentiary near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this horror film to a level superior. He has a great feeling of apprehension, established from the start. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here; this earned him the directorial concert "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and he has indeed started an impressive career in traditional action films, thrillers and horror films. <br /> <br /> He may have basic characters, but his actors are capable. Bring them to life: Chelsea Field, the young woman vying for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick, veteran convict Cresus, Tom Everett, agitated con, Rabbitt, Ivan Kane, outgoing Lasagna, Tommy "Tiny" Lister, the soft-spoken giant Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder in the role of Captain Horton. It should also be noted that Kane Hodder (as an avenging spirit) first helped to win Jason Voorhees' position in the series "Friday the 13th". <br /> <br /> Decent Special Effects Mac Ahlberg, director of the prolific genre scene, phantasmagorical music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone, stunning visuals, an incredibly dark place and a flashy and intense overall presentation contribute to the to entertain. It's mean, horrible and fun for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
