Hitchcock displays his already developed understanding of visual elements in this first silent film. The plot of the film, featuring two boxers fighting over a girl, is a simple drama, without much recommendation. Hitchcock's talent, however, lies in its amazing use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual symbols. The jewels that a boxer offers the girl just before she marries the other boxer are particularly memorable. He slips it into his arm in a clearly sexual way and with a single gesture, Hitch shows us everything we need to know. The boxing scenes are well managed with interesting shots that prove once again how much Hitchcock was ahead of his time. The film also gives an overview of his subsequent treatment of women. The object of the boxers' desires is motivated by money and lust, not by reason or love. The only other women in the film are either beautiful party-goers who make open sex offers or old people who help destroy happy relationships. Overall, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual narrator.
