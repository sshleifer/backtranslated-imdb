I'm not a John Cleese completist (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was great), but I'm a fan and when I saw this neglected session on a shelf of my local Blockbuster, I decided to try it out.What I got is a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest viewing experiences I've ever had.The writing is typical of English "goon show" schtick. "Firesign Theater." But the execution and timing are perfect and that makes "Strange Case" a kind of breathtaking performance that can create fanatics of British comedy for life. <br /> <br /> The British have a gift for the combination of largely satirical lanterns with well-timed "tics" of character and timing, the creators use them wisely here, has such a talent for the physical comedy that he holds more than his own. Here is Arthur Lowe, who interprets "Watson" as an awesome idiot but improbably incomprehensible, with a timing and a presentation so perfect that it becomes the best aspect of the film. I had never heard of Lowe before (his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his entire career with this performance, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Some people might not do it take care of "Strange Case ...", especially if the British fantasy is not their "tea tea". But I am extremely happy to have seen it before it disappears.
