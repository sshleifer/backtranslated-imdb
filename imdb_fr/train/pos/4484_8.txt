Released a few months before the end of the war, "Anchors Aweigh" is one of Gene Kelly's greatest musical triumphs in the forties ?? <br /> <br /> Under the direction of George Sidney, he enjoys a nice score and, best of all, services from Gene Kelly in his first real role in MGM ?? The previous year, in Columbia's "Cover Girl", he had revealed an innovative approach to on-screen dance, a light but pleasing voice, and considerable charm in "Aweigh Anchors", although it was featured by Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson. he laid the solid foundation for his most revealing years at MGM ?? <br /> <br /> The film's story, a kind of running for "On the Town" four years later, follows sailors Kelly and Sinatra on shore leave, spending their holidays in Hollywood, where they get involved in the business of an aspiring singer (Grayson) and her little nephew (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> Grayson, it seems, has a heart set for an audition with the conductor-pianist Jose Iturbi ??

(from "Tom and Jerry" fame). Charming and innovative, he cleverly combines real action and animation in the story of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor of the "Pomeranian Navy", wearing a shirt with stripes and a beret, shows him how to dance ??
