In my opinion, it's one of the best action movies of the 1970s. Not only is it a superb cast, but there are also wild shootings and explosions that still impress today. The story is about a Vietnamese veterinarian (Kris Kristofferson) recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element of a small town and what happens when Kris begins to take advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of. It's great to see Kris play against a guy. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both offer valuable support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. Jan-Michael shows the real movie star in this movie. I do not think that Vigilante Force is in video, but it sometimes appears on television. It's a great movie for guys who love movies.
