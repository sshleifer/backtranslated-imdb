I think "Blackadder the Third" is the best of the series. <br /> <br /> In fact, all episodes are funny. Personally, I really like the episode of "the French invasion", but that of the superstitious actors. , in 'MACBETH' is also very funny, the way Rowan continues to play with them is really a humor (English) at the highest level. <br /> <br /> Actors: 'Never say that again, always call it Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, so you want me to say the Scottish game? Actors: YES Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have most of his work, but I think he did the Blackadder series particularly well. <Br/> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his great style, but I think we can count on him because he is already working on a Bean 2 movie, which will be released this year, I can not wait. .. <br /> <br /> I give this 3rd Blackadder a rating of 9 out of 10.
