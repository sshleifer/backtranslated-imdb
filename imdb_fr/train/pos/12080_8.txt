Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to serve as a secretary to the wealthy Hughes family so that her boyfriend may leave her. Almost immediately, she is drugged and shipped to the Cornwall family estate. When she wakes up, they continue to tell her that she is Marion Hughes, that she has a mental illness and that she is locked up ... but why? You will probably guess why but do not bother because this one is fun. <br /> <br /> With "The Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask", here is one of the best B pictures ever made. (The B images were low-budget images made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as necessary (only 65 minutes), it's well directed, fast and exciting. It just stumbles at the end, which I found a little too implausible. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) goes well in mind but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and scary) like the bad guys. It's worth it to catch. A perfect example of how you can make a good movie with a small budget.
