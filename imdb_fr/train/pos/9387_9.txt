As others have commented, I checked that after Siskel and Ebert ranked it among their top 10 movies of the year. Which gift. I then went to buy it, just to lend it. <br /> <br /> Best quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is above his cabin. When Cage looks down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I scared you." Yoakum shoves his gun into Cage's face with "Does this look scary?" A lot of humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> It really gave a sense of fun. The constant observation of the sign "Welcome to Red Rock" causes a groan and a smile nodding. The music gave the film a quality of hunting and curiosity reminiscent of that of "Twin Peaks". Unlike "Twin Peaks," however, this does not spoil things by going too far in the wacky, needing to "surpass itself". <br /> <br /> I admit to having watched the credits 15 to 20 times. You see, they had "Thousand Miles from Nowhere" of Yoakum (perfectly chosen) playing like a freight train rolled to the desert floor. . with snowy mountains in the distance. It was amazing, the framing fluid. In addition, I have never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film. In addition, this fits perfectly with the story.
