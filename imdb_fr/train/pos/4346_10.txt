Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in the entertainment business. I read his two books and I think he's great. Peter Faulk can deliver a striking line with the best of them. The combination of both is magic. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a family that is starting to really get to know each other. During a car trip, a father and son connect for the first time in a family crisis. They do everything that fathers and sons are supposed to do in life ... they do it much later in life. The situations are very funny, but have the feeling that they could happen to people in real life (not obsolete or caricatured). This is the first time I look at Paul Reiser and I fully believe in all the emotions presented. Sometimes his eyes are so sad. <br /> <br /> GRET movie, beautiful story and screenplay. Comedy and emotion, but edifying message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great job too :)
