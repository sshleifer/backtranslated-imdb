Well, if you're open-minded enough to love Barber Shop, then you'll love this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you will give him the current score he has: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for anyone who is willing to watch movies outside their home territory. It's engaging, it's true, on two or three occasions, you lose the links between the scenes, but often, especially towards the end, you end up with a tear or two in the eyes and that simply because reflects that that can be life. <br /> <br /> I love it and recommend it to anyone who has an open mind beyond the traditional American film.
