Sleepwalkers are creatures that drain the life force of humans to survive ... but they can only use virgins (the reason for their existence is not explained). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) must feed his mother, Mary (Alice Krige). He goes after the friendly Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will she escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it's a BIG horror movie. A fast pace, lots of blood and blood and a good sense of humor twisted. There are many joke references for horror buffs (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (who would have thought he could act after "Return to the Blue Lagoon"), just like Kirge and Amick. But I find this film annoying. <br /> <br /> It was written for the screen by Stephen King and it's extremely vague. Sleepwalkers are never fully explained. Where do they come from? Why are they called that? Why does the son have to feed his mother? Why do cats hate them and can kill them? What are their powers after all (at one point, Krause makes a car disappear AND changes color and style!)? Why do they need to feed on the life force of people? Why must it be only virgins? Why does the son have sex with his mother? None of these things are explained, leaving the story puzzling. It's a shame because, apart from these issues, this is an excellent horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, bloody and full of fun. If only the script was better. A rather explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige has also been modified (you can see) to get the R mark. I can only give a 7.
