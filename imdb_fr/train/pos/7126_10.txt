This film resonated with me on two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and thrown to reluctant hosts in a country village. As I escaped the bombing and had experiences that produced precious memories (for example, hearing a nightingale singing a dark night for the very first time) and enjoying a life I could never have living in London, I missed my family and scared me. Tom is an old man whose wife and child are dead and lives alone in a small village. As an old man without a wife whose children got married and live far away in another province, I sometimes feel lonely again. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas of raising a child. Since a deep affection has grown between old Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom goes looking for him and finally saves him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story, there is a great tension because, because of a bureaucratic decision, it seems that the child will lose someone who has developed a relationship with him.
