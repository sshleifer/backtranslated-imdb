First of all, it's simply the funniest movie I've ever seen. It incorporates a slapstick, a sexual humor and a clever stand-up. But it goes further than that. Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we do not see often) that gave me hope that there is love, that two people who love each other can overcome their ordeal; and that such a comical vision of life (something that I think we should all have) can be accepted by the people who really matter. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope we will see more films from everyone involved in the future.
