I have seen this film many times and I will never tire of it. It's a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterically funny and yet quite touching. For those of you who are not fans of "subtitles" or foreign film in general, open your mind. This is an excellent movie for "the beginner" because the story is so much fun. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it's just laughing at one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> I can not even think of that movie without a smile !! I like it ... and I think most people will like it too.
