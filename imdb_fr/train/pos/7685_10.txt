Another success of Norman Lear describing in detail the problems that African-Americans had to face in the turmoil of the 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> With Esther Rolle and her husband, accompanied by 3 children living in a high-rise project in Chicago in a neighborhood-dominated black neighborhood, the show describes what blacks were going through with an owner (the black agent Mr. Bookman) as well as the prices and everyday problems of mere existence. <br /> <br /> The 3 children describe how people seem to face their problems differently - from comedic JJ to militant Ralph Carter, to their girl who also aspired to succeed, this show was a perfect description of the African-American life.
