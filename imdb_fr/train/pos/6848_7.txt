A very stupid movie, which begins with a sweet porn sequence, ventures into a wacky comedy in the art gallery, adds the shock of a discovery in the hotel room, then introduces a random murder without obvious reason . <br /> <br /> The following is bizarre and surreal (the chronometer scene in particular is extremely useless), resulting in a revealing "twisting" end that is as obvious as it is unfair to the viewer (see section "Anecdotes" to know precisely why it is deliberately unfair). The film does its utmost to offend as many groups as possible - transsexuals, insane, and the magnificent racial stereotype of the "Huggie Bear" style in the subway - and treat the viewer patronizingly an idiot in the last scenes, while the characters are constantly explaining one after another in a very detailed and repeated what just happened in the film. Even though the background characters of the restaurants scene at the end are a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a pleasure to watch: despite its many flaws, its package as a whole, well, works.
