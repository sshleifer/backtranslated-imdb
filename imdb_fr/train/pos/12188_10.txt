The pure genius of Orson Welles makes it one of the greatest movies. Welles is involved in an assassination plot only to be erected as an autumn man, to which he refers with the sarcastic comment "the great mannequin I am". The plot is so complex that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The scene of the shooting in the Hall of Carnival Mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed. This scene alone is worth the price of entry. This is the only time Rita Hayworth has played a complex but credible character. No one but Welles would have the courage to cut his hair and dye them in copper blonde. No one should miss this picture.
