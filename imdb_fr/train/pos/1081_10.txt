One of the great classic comedies. Not a burlesque comedy, not a heavy drama. A fun and satirical movie, a guide for buyers heading to a new home. <br /> <br /> Filled with awesome characters Cary Grant is convinced he is ready to fly into the building of a dream house. <br /> <br /> Look at life in the late 40s. <br /> <br />
