It looks like a biography of Claude Monet, but it's actually a very focused story about the relationship between three teenage girls from a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to talk to, no school, and the boys are represented by a peripheral figure, the brilliant Francis, who enters the story determined from time to time and who always leaves confused . <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three, aspiring only to join the team she admires so much. She is a little weird. She has not yet emerged from her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs, tall feet and no doubt. She is prognathic and sports these plump lips. After a while, her appearance grows and, from some angles, she may seem fascinating. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older, older, well, more physically developed. What glamorous figure she put in her swimsuit, strolling around, teasing the boys, stirring her long blond hair But she is not what it seems. Where is she? I could not understand everything. The French are long on paradoxes and short on coherence. No wonder François always looks for it. <br /> <br /> There is not so much ambiguity in Louse Blachere's character. She is also part of the team, but she is simple, sensitive and sensitive, and has an intense crush on François. Blachere is a good actress and adds to the character's unpleasant character by her performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between these three characters, namely intrigues, disappointments, hidden feelings and all the rest of this association with girls who spend a lot of time with each other. others. This is of course a delicate subject. This becomes more delicate during the progressive development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should expect it to be a sweet porn movie. The only nudity we see is much less than excitement, and the little sex under the covers, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much, partly because it's more suggestive than expressed by the action, partly because it's complex and partly because I'm not sure I understood everything. <br /> <br /> Let me give you an example. Okay. Adele is the girl that others envy. She is also quite distant and satisfied with herself. On top of that, she is apparently turning down all the boys and men in sight if they can be useful to her, from the handsome, dumb François to the bus driver for whom she wants a favor. She boasts shamelessly of his expertise in fellatio. When Pauline asks her to join the swimming team, Adele uses it as a landmark during her meetings with the guys. A superior and indulgent narcissist, you know? But then the so-called slut takes the lean Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she is still a virgin. Really? Yes really. Pauline begins to get closer to Adele and Adele finally confesses that she would like to get rid of her hymen and she would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, now sexually attracted by Adèle, performs this task with a moderate taste. NOW, Adele would REALLY want to face up with a man of preferably older and experienced. So she takes Pauline to a box where she dances seductively with a guy until she follows Pauline in the bathroom. The two girls look at each other without having openly manifested a sexual interest in the other. But Adele is so close that Pauline slowly looses her own reins, raises her head and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele recoiled with a smile and said, "Now, it was not so bad, was it?" Then she goes back to the club. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty close description of what's going on between Pauline and Adele - but what's going on? At first, Adele treats Pauline as an irrelevant child, later as a close friend, finally as a potential lover - and the minute Pauline responds, Adele leaves, satisfied. Does she use Pauline as she seems to use men? Does it reassure Adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I despised Louise Blachère as the third member of the trio, the unified and overripe wallflower, whose expression always suggests a state of stupefaction, but which is at least completely heterosexual and the first of the three to get rid of this noisome virginity, but I have ignored it only for considerations of space. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? By all means. (Compare this to the typical American film about high school students.) For men, some of whom have never penetrated the female mystic, this can give you an idea of ​​what it looks like in the middle plane.
