This punchy and often violent Western western in the Peckinpah / Leone tradition is surprisingly directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, whose previous westerns (especially those in which John Wayne starred) were mostly in John Ford fashion. It's both surprisingly traditional (good / bad) and incredibly modern. <br /> <br /> Heston describes a former captain of the Arizona Territorial Police who has been retired for a year. He ceded the reins of law enforcement to a sheriff inspired by the reform (Michael Parks) and found in the early years of the twentieth century the means to enforce the law by cars, telegraphs, telephones and railways. But soon, he faces a threat from his past: a MÃ©tis outlaw (Coburn) that he has stowed more than a decade ago for a train robbery that killed four guards. In a later shootout, Coburn's wife was killed; and so Coburn is out for some kind of vengeance. This involves the kidnapping and possibly rape of Heston's (Hershey) daughter by him and his gang. The result is a tense and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona. <br /> <br /> THE LAST HARD MEN, inspired by Brian Garfield's novel "Gun Down", is violent in many places, including Heston's confrontation with Coburn, as well as the rape scene involving Hershey and two Coburn gang members (Quade, Paull) are probably as questionable as similar scenes in STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE. But that does not hurt the film's psychological approach to Western genre. McLaglen is able to handle this bloody story with a great panache, and Heston's performance as an aging lawyer was probably the best he has ever given in his 1970s movies. Coburn is particularly heavy, and Parks and Chris Mitchum (Hershey's future husband) are also doing good things. The music here is based on Jerry Goldsmith's score of 100 RIFLES and the 1966 STAGECOACH remake, but it still works here. <br /> <br /> Carefully shot totally in southeastern Arizona, the film LAST HARD MEN will soon be released by Fox on VHS and / or DVD. It's a western that deserves nothing less.
