Well, this is perhaps one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy is a tour de force! Alas, her career has never really taken off but, finally, we will always remember her for her three first-rate photos: "The King Of Comedy", "Dallas Doll" and "Without you, I'm nothing ". She has been involved in different personalities, ranging from social figures from New York to Diana Ross, to create a scathing and hilarious critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and fierce, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholy, she convinces audiences in all scenes and she is actually "really pretty". Look at this one (if you're not from Iowa), you'll definitely appreciate it!
