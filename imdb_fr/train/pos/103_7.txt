When I read other reviews, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First, especially for Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; pretty good ... <br /> <br /> Film, very intelligent and interesting because, the actors have a lot of actors and international actors, especially European, like Turkey and Russia ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Second, The story is basic and you can guess, but if you are passionate about action, you will like in my opinion ... <br /> <br /> Third chapter, the last chapter is neither special nor interesting, it's like other action movies .. <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend you watch this movie ... And I hope you will love to enjoy: D
