Yes, a real classic! That's the British drama, the realism and the minimal use of special effects (and budgets too inflated). The last time I saw this drama during his last appearance on British Terrestial television in 1994, he should be watched by anyone who loves a scary plot, not a big name but a simply awesome acting. unknown and, as such, it is unlikely that this great drama is broadcast any time soon.I myself recently bought The Woman In Black in VHS, so I will be able to enjoy again this great British drama. You should try and enjoy it too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
