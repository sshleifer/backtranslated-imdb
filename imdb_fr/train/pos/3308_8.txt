The power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang-Soo's second feature film. He clearly reiterates what he had begun in his previous film, including multiple related stories (in this case, two), and stories of relationship disturbances, as well as a powerful dosage of irony. <br /> <br /> One thing that is clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights that include elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains a single surreal moment that contrasts with the otherwise rather realistic description. The two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with her friends, but is attracted by a stranger. The second is about a man who also travels to Kangwon Province with his friend and struggles with his relationship. <br /> <br /> Again, Hong demonstrates a strong understanding of the irony and flaws of human nature, yet I do not think he's totally indifferent to his characters, just attracting enough compassion to make up for the criticism he draws with his irony. I think I think that I really like Hong's movies, that they feel so real, especially the complex and conflicting characters. This does not mean that each person is a hypocrite or suffers from confused feelings, but rather that those characters that he and the actors present feel fully developed and credible. <br /> <br /> This film is not moving fast. There are many expectations and, as in the previous movie, things do not always connect immediately, so patience is paying off and surprising. There seems to be no element of the film that is not intentionally placed in the film and it makes me a little hyper conscious of various seemingly extra characters, as they drag in the mix as the film progresses . <BR /> <br /> Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion, of regret, into a story that highlights the irony and fallibility of human decision-making. It's a balancing act that's hard to maintain, and it's amazing how Hong manages to succeed twice. The values ​​of technical production have improved significantly since the first film and the first direction are clear and stable. This film does not have the same emotional weight as the first, but earns a lot in assured exploration and refinement, which really helps to tighten the global vision. Great visualization for lovers of art cinema. 8/10.
