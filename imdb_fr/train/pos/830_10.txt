I did not have many expectations in the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is remarkable in a very different role. He threw the sleek armani suits for a ridiculous and paid look by showing that he is an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play for each other and have been one of the best couples for a long time. The humor is dark, the performances of Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are excellent, mix this with a touching element to the story of friendship, and you have an excellent film. It's probably one of the best comedies of friends in a long time. It's a film that clearly shows that we can expect great things in the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career.
