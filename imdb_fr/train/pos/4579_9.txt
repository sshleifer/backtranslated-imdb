I think this movie was really good. It's a little odd that the Olsen twins are now 13 and a boyfriend. I liked them a lot when they were little, at the Full House. Anyway, the cast was good and the movie was a bit funny. I got a little mixed up with all the switching locations and their names. It's just kind of an old version of It Takes Two.
