Mendez and Marichal provided us with a serious, compelling and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis engendered by 108 years of colonialism in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the hottest people I've met and yet, because our country refuses to assume its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Ricans are allowed to perish and die. <br /> <br /> The spiritual crisis that has affected the colonial situation of Puerto Rico has created, if undermine families, and the basic institutions that support any society. Corruption is widespread as people do not pay taxes (which led to a financial crisis for the country) and a feeling of cynicism and mistrust permeates the island's culture. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a grant allowed this painful but powerful film to produce. <br /> <br /> To see absolutely. . .
