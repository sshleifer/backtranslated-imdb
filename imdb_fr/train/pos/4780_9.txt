Always liked this movie from the cover of the video. Finally, we ended up buying this film for a sale of 5 pieces and what it is a movie. A simply stunning performance of all cases and it is filmed so beautifully. Even sometimes, from a distance, you hardly hear the dialogue, as if you were really at this distance, picking up fragments of the story. It's very moving, often funny and very watchable. Little dialogue, but filmed in such a way that you feel so comfortable. A 9/10 of me. A must see.
