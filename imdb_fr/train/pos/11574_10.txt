This film is a half-documentary ... and it's pretty interesting .... <br /> <br /> It's a good movie ... based on the true story of how a group of saboteurs Norwegians managed to stop heavy water production at Rukjan in Norway and the delivery of the remaining heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This film is not perfect and could have been a little better ... the best part of the film indicates that some saboturs are played alone !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of the Second World War and you film, it is a film that deserves the detour !!
