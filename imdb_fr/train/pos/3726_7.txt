I did not expect Joel Schumacher to shoot very high-caliber, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> In technique, he is often derived from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, with his bumpy camera work, his granular shots, the film that sometimes turns as if he jumped from a pinion - all these techniques used by Speilberg to make his film more realistic, but ultimately more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not so weak, because the characters in this movie seemed more like real characters and the story was less artificial and less wrapped in the American flag (Speilberg 'in subtlety). <br /> <br /> Next to the first part of Kubrick's full metal jacket, here's the most realistic portrait of the training camp I saw in a movie, and I think it's worth the worth watching. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie either.
