I took the film without cover and did not even know what it was, but when I looked at it, I laughed so much. It's now one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the guys have created a masterpiece. I highly recommend this film to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you Rusty for giving us a laugh.
