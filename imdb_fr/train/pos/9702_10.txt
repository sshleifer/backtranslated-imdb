the town of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and too disturbing, but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well. Most people will know others with a touch of character, but fortunately no one knows such extreme personalities as Tubbs and Edward, the hateful owners of the local shop or hating strangers, or Pauline, obsessed with the quill, who treats the Dole scum "with a lot of contempt. These were just some of the strange inhabitants. The television works consists of 3 series and a Christmas special. There are references to many horror movies, such as the wicker man. A movie, the League of Men's Apocypses, is a more recent addition to the lineup. I will not say much, but I highly recommend it. In total, the Gentlemen's League is a hilarious comedy with brilliant writing and brilliant characters. I would certainly say that it is worth watching because you will not regret it!
