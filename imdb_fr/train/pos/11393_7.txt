Uggh! This film did not really impress me, although I must admit that it is technically well done. He gets a 7 for very high production values, but as far as entertainment values ​​are concerned, it is rather mediocre. In fact, I consider it to be one of the most overrated films of the '50s. He won the Best Film Oscar, but the movie is just boring from time to time with so much dancing and dance. Indeed, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs and a story and a strong acting (such as MEET ME IN ST LOUIS), this film is almost everything in song and dance. In fact, this movie has the longest song and dance number in history and if you're not interested in it, it will quickly annoy you. Give me more history! As a result, with exaggerated production figures and a weak history, this film resembles a balanced meringue diet - it just is not enough to satisfy in the long run. <br /> <br /> Think ... it's the movie that beat "A streetcar named desire" and "A place in the sun" for the best movie! And, to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" have not even been nominated in this category! What is even more amazing to me is that "Ace in the Hole" lost to Best Writing, the screenplay of this movie - even though "An American in Paris" had almost no story to tell and was mainly animated by dance and song.
