Such a happy world was created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; we are immersed in a world that can not be documented with as much pleasure as in a film, but more precisely in a universe that can only be documented in the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what a rich and exuberant world can offer animation ?? when is it in the right hands? The life of an insect is a warm reminder. We leave the film with a feeling of equal warmth and a sense of satisfaction derived from high-caliber film productions. <br /> <br /> This is only Pixar's second animated feature film. The Disney subgroup made its spectacular debut and perhaps even inadvertently branded itself in the film world three years earlier in 1995, with its historical film Toy Story. It was a film that defies conventions, reinvents, breathes new life into animation and sets a new level of excellence. Now, they come back with their second year effort which, to be honest, draws in all of us an insidious cynicism before seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> After all, it's a movie about ants. Well, all the insects 'and insects' worldly walks are covered in A Bug's Life, but it's the ant that's the focal point of this film, just as human beings are the focal point of dramas, novels etc. How can such an insignificant animal species, such as an ant, play the protagonist role of a film, let alone the premise of a feature film? They are joking surely. However, we forget that, in Toy Story, many objects in the toy box could become the largest, most inspiring and most adorable group of animated heroes and villains ever invented. Pixar guys do the same thing and turn a group of dirty, tiny bugs into the most endearing and pleasurable gang of vermin you've ever met. <br /> <br /> Not only are not they. they are all completely friendly and friendly ?? there is no unpleasant character in sight; Even the bad guys are fascinating characters ?? but they are colorful, they are eclectic and they are idiosyncratic. And the range of characters is also gigantic, for lack of a better term. It only adds to the rich levels of distinction already glued to A Bug's Life from the beginning. We will start with our main character and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley) and his character is rather generic, to say the least. Of the thousands of loyal and obedient worker ants residing on the beautiful and lush Ant Island, he is considered the "black sheep" of the clan, as seen in the first moments of the film when he inadvertently destroyed the harvest of the season with his antics. <br /> <br /> The problem arises in the fact that the ant harvest is for a group of avid grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their anger and autocracy among small ants wretched; when they come to Ant Island for their annual banquet and find that their offering has disappeared, they go crazy for lack of a better term. Hopper proposes to save ants from total extinction in the hands of his bag; However, it is a negotiation that is simply impossible to achieve. The cogs and the wheels of Flik's spirit run at full speed despite his guilt and shame, and he proposes to leave Ant Island in search of powerful insect warriors who can come to the rescue of the colony. beat against Hopper and grasshoppers. <BR /> <br /> If you think about it, A Bug's Life is very similar to the plot of Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, or to the American remake The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of unhappy but kindly is threatened by malicious and evil enemies ?? a lonely villager seeks help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to chase away evil. In A Bug's Life, the help takes the form of a discouraging circus troupe, which Flik mistakenly perceives as warriors in a bar fight. <br /> <br /> There is a great fun of these scenes and a lot of fun emerges from these beasties of the circus troupe. Among them are a scholarly insect (David Hyde Pierce), an obese German split-division caterpillar, named Heimlich, and a ladybug almost femme fatale which is actually a crisp ladybug and male (Dennis Hopper). It is extremely pleasant to watch these insects on the screen, to watch the insects and insects interact on the screen, as well as the entire movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, there is a lot of fun and joy. out of their characters and joyful interactions with each other, which give way to a multitude of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and fascinating situations and ultimately a dazzling film. What makes the life of A Bug even better is that the film is not just for kids as many people think, even if kids would find more fun in this movie. the child-friendly clich√© situations are a little more abundant than we would like. However, it is easy to ignore this mistake and enjoy this movie in an incredibly simple way. <br /> <br /> Even though A Bug's Life may not meet the dizzying, historic standards set by its predecessor, it's still a great movie, and the beginning of something promising here . Pixar proved it was not a single wonder, but a group of talented and talented artists in Hollywood. They raise the bar without end, and when someone always succeeds in respecting his standards, it is only by himself. What more to say about A Bug's Life apart: see; it's not quite the best we've seen at Emeryville, California, but it beats the lot of its year ?? and I'll be damned if it's not the best animated feature film of 1998. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
