Yes, it's one of the great musicals I've grown up with such talented artists as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the small and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dance is superb. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there's Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is pretty unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's big underrated stars. I saw it again on A & E TV and also in my old video tapes. Do not get tired of these old musicals. What happened to Hollywood ??
