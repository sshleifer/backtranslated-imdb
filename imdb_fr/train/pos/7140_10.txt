20 of 10 This is a truly wonderful story of a wartime evacuee and a charismatic carpenter, Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is staying at Tom's place and it is immediately obvious that he has serious problems when he wets his bed the first night. William is illiterate and scared, but in one way or another, both are comforting each other in the solitude of each other. It turns out that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choir leader in a fun rendition of Jerusalem. William is befriended by Zacharias Wrench, a Jewish boy also from London. With Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and to feel that he is part of this small united community. When he settles, William is called back to London by his mother. It is here that we see why he is so damned. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom does not hear about William, he goes to London to pick him up. He finds him finally holding his little dead sister where he was tied up in a cellar. After a period of hospitalization, Tom realizes that he has to remove it and bring it home. The culmination is a bittersweet end when William is told that he will be adopted by Tom, while learning that his best friend, Zacharias, was killed in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom was speaking to a Home Office manager. <br /> <br /> I love him, that's what he's worth, I think he loves me too. <br /> <br /> Is not it better than that?
