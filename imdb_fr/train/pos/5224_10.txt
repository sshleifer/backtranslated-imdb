Ayone who complains about the hogwash of this movie or the fact that there was no plot was to be looking for "Jean de Florrette". HI! This film was designed to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you want to skin the bullshit of this film, they seem to miss the point. This film is clearly made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor" that seems to me just a bunch of dirty shit. The fact is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more aware that some people's sense of humor may not match yours before killing you. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
