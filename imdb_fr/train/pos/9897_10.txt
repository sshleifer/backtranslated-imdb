Okay, sorry, but I loved this movie. I love the genre of the 80s of this kind of movies, because we do not see much like this one! I want to ask all those who say that this film is a scam or an imitation of cheese, what does it imitate? I have never seen a film like this, well, no horror anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is the popular group at school, which likes everyone to live in hell, so they decided to stick to that. nerdy boy named Marty. It becomes fatal when he is really hurt by one of their little pranks. <br /> <br /> 10 years later, the group of friends who hurt Marty begin receiving meeting letters in high school. But ... they are the only ones to receive them! So they go back to the old school and get hit one by one by ....... Yeah, you probably know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me is the end. It could have been left, or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try, and do not be too critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
