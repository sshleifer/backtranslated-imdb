This film pleasantly surprised me. He has a touching, slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. It's a movie I've never heard of, but if you want a "sleeper", that's it. Excellent writing, production and acting. I highly recommend it to audiences who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why is not it more made of this film?
