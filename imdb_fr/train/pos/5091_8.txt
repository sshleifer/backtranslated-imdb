Watch both parties twice. I enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older hero, Patrick Swayze. He was very credible as a hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly surpassed Richard Chamberlain's performance. I admit that I would have preferred to see someone else as the "Lady in distress". Alison Doody should stick to modern, non-period pieces. She did not have the look of the woman of the nineteenth century. The rest of the cast was awesome and followed the plot very well. I am happy to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to be considered as aging. Age is inevitable, but do not hide it. A man over 50 can be a lot sexier (and Patrick is really sexy) than a young guy, no matter how pretty he is. Hooray for the lines of characters to go with a big smile.
