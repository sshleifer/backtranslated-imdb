I saw this film for the first time when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I absolutely loved it and I felt sorry to repeat it a little later and I missed it. I was delighted by the story and the characters, but especially by the haunting and beautiful music. It was the original version dubbed in English that I saw - sometimes mistakenly called "Streamline Dub" (the dubbing was actually Ghibli and only distributed by Streamline) which is unfortunately only available as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc. box. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have the impression that this release was partly spoiled by Disney. The dubbing is correct but the dialogue does not have the same energy as the dubbing "streamline" or the original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek seems too old to play the main role. They made useless changes, such as changing the name of the main character of "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added a dialogue. But worst of all, I have the feeling that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships, for example, was originally silent, but it was spoiled by the Disney's senseless need to play music when nobody talks boring in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This film always sweeps the most recent animated films, and I can not recommend it too much. The plot is simple but captivating and the film shows a talent that unfortunately misses most of the homogeneous animations on the modern mass market.
