Ok, let's face it. it's a terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is horrible, the acting game worse. But the film was made for a reason and only one, like all those terrible Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti at its peak. Ok, so maybe Lanza's films were also an excuse for him to attack women, but this movie is about Luciano's listening. This alone is worth watching the movie. A great star of opera stuck to himself faces his fears, finds humility and love along the way, and announces many successes, too. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am prejudiced in many ways. . I am Italian. I am a big fan of Pavarotti (is there anything in Pavarotti that is not huge, including its fan base?). And when I saw this movie for the first time, I went out alone, seeing the breadth and depth of the possibilities of life and lovers for the first time. So, terrible as this film is, the beautiful voice and memories are enough for me to breathe in the depths of my life and so that I love it again. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's corny and awful. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is what it's about. So I give this film a high score in the hope that someone who has never heard Pavarotti listens, looks and enjoys a new level of music and love, especially since he left. Like Italian cuisine you've never tried, try it! You could be pleasantly surprised, as a lover of Luciano or future painter Pavarotti.
