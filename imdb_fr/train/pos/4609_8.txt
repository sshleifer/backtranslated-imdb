Probably the best film of Jackie Chan in the 1980s, and the one who put it on the map. The scale of this self-directed police drama is evident in the opening and closing scenes, during which a squatter village and shopping center are demolished. There are obviously differences between the Chinese version and the doubled English version, many jokes failing in the latter. The latter is also bothered by stars who are nothing like their original Chinese. In fact, the only thing the dubbing corrected is the lawsuit, at the time. The trials in the colonial colonies of Hong Kong had been conducted in English, while in the original, this scene was in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Chan the fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humor wherever possible, so that the non-Cantonese audience does not miss much. After all, it's not the dialogue that makes a Chan film, but the action and the painful shots. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays the role of an incorruptible Hong Kong detective who chases a gangland godfather (Cho Yeun) and is responsible for protecting a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is superb from start to finish and there is not much time to breathe between the two. It will never make you think, but what an entertaining and well-crafted movie. We can say that this is one of the best martial arts movies.
