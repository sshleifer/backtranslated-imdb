I remember this Swedish TV show. I was only 7 years old and it scared me a lot. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this series again and see if it was just as good as I remember that I suspect that my tastes and requirements have changed. Although this was published before Alien and a plethora of other thrillers in space, I suspect it finds its roots in horror movies of the '50s and the political climate of the' 70s: s. When I think about it, it was a real sci-fi film, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political issues about who we are and who we are. The term science fiction has since become dark and has become the term for any film with spaceships.
