Four prisoners share a single cell: the domineering transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), the idiot and learned companion of Marcus, eats all that is in sight, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new type trapped in corporate fraud and now dedicated to escape. After a brick has fallen from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden newspaper written by a serial killer obsessed with "The fountain of youth" who occupied the cell in the twenties. Is this newspaper the secret of their escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind that? <br /> <br /> I was a little tired of getting into this movie because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008), to be considered as the worst film released in room I have never seen. However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan's appalling scenario, because (if I remember correctly), Valette's guidelines were not the worst aspects of the film (to unless he chose to include the baby). In any case, Maleficent was a good way to regain my respect. . . it's a French film (obviously something I like) and it's set in prison (my second favorite horror scenario after the asylums). So that's two points for him even before the film starts. Fortunately, Valette once had the film finished. Maleficent is a story of obsession and desperation deep enough, rather complex and rather fascinating. . . the desire and the need to realize fantasies. Although it's not a terrifying movie in the traditional sense, its strange power makes it really terrifying. The period between climax and conclusion has been one of the best movies I have seen for some time and I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a decent psychological thriller with a pretty cool gore. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. A little respect earned by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount got the rights to make an American remake (surprise surprise). It should come out in 2009. To be honest, I'm not sure why, it does not seem like a lot of money here in the United States. But, I was already surprised. <br /> <br /> Long live France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
