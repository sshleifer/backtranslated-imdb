White man + progress + industrialization = ADB. First Nations + nature + animals = GOOD. Simple formula. In fact, in recent times, the same type of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now he is used to attack it. However, that being said, I think the film manages to overcome the old-fashioned politicization, as it addresses the themes of freedom and the original nature so as to please everyone. You may not agree with the unbridled revisionism of the film about how the West was won or lost. But everyone can feel the burning need for days when horses could run freely in the western plains. (The film also avoids the fact that there were no horses in America until the bad-white man brought them there). In any case, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the foreground - is amazing.
