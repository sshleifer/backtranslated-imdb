This film is a source of inspiration for anyone who is or has been in a difficult stalemate, financially or emotionally. You will certainly laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Left in a bad financial situation at the death of her husband, Grace must find a new way to earn money and it is not really legal, which adds to the humor. Even my boyfriend liked it, so do not think it's a chick.
