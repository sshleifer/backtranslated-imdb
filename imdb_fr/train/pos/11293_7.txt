William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit play Broadway with Music / Recruitment, but his own military engagements have taken place and have been assigned to one of the most improbable helmsmen: George Cukor. The "director of women" has a sure touch in the many documentary sequences of the training of Air Corps and he invests with a humanity even greater than what the kind generally allows him, especially in time of war. Of course, the group of beginners (and wholly white, with the exception of an unbanked US-Chinese rookie) is more beautiful and healthier than in real life, and the talk about the house and about mom and wife and the child become rather thick. it is an effective and undeniably attractive propaganda. Also notable for the male members of the military, many of whom have not returned for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in the shoes of an Andrews), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. For a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who does not show up for an hour and a half, but who has some good little footage as a worried-sick woman in Brooklyn. Too bad that his rights are entangled and that the only known impression is the 16 mm; it is obvious that, after the publication of Twentieth Century Fox (with considerable success), the rights have been returned to the Army, and if there is a good impression in 35mm format, it is probably somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It is misleading and corny in places, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war, and it deserves to be seen more widely.
