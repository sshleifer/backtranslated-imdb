This has been a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only beautiful but hilarious in this movie. (I think Lucille Ball may have modeled her later career on Davies' style, which could be described as "crazy beauty.") Vidor's direction is light but sure, the story is funny, of course but the acting is wonderfully contemporary. and the star-gazing element for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds to the overall enjoyment. It combines very well the elements of burlesque with the drama for adults and the good old romanticism timeless. For all movie buffs who have an instinctive reaction to watching silent movies, listen to it and it may change your attitude. <br /> <br />
