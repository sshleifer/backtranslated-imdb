Back to basics with "as in heaven" - what are the true values ​​of life? These Swedes transmit a message that appeals to all hearts. We have seen it twice now in a cinema filled to the last place: the pure and joyful love within the music of a simple choir but full of power once everyone has found his inner tone. <br /> <br /> From celebrity to school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted to become his new home after collapsing on stage, Daniel wants to start listening and is immersed in the life of the simple, warm and difficult people of the North. <br /> <br /> He wins hearts with music and gains the ability to love and be loved unconditionally. <br /> <br /> Do not go see him if you've been normalized in Hollywood. This thing does not contain extras, only your laugh, your compassion, your tears!
