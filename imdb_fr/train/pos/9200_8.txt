I have read countless articles about the fact that this game is so similar to Max Payne. When I first played it, I thought it was a weird game that looked like an arcade game with the desire to steal the Max Payne style (not just-time). So when I played it for a few hours, I realized how fun it was! and how different from "Max Payne", yes the ball time is a bit similar, but I think it fits differently to the style of play. This game is a non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up, so much fun, like a big fan of Max Payne, I must say that the DTR scenario is not close to the size of Max Payne, the graphics are a bit average and some levels are similar, but if you want a little more of this "ball at the right time", you should definitely own this game.
