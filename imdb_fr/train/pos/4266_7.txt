The first time we saw that there is a half-life on a black and white TV in a small Samoan village, I thought it was hilarious. Now, after seeing it for the second time, much later, I do not find it hilarious. I can not find anything hilarious anymore. But it's a spiritual and light comedy that moves quickly without stumbling and that I liked a lot. <br /> <br /> We are in 1945 and Fred MacMurray is a 4F who is dying to join the armed forces. He rubs a lamp in the case he manages and a genius seems to grant him some wishes. (Hmm, no, but if the introduction is not more than satisfactory, the fantasies are very alive.) MacMurray tells the genie that he wants to be part of the army. Poof, and he walks with the Washington soldiers in a particularly warm and inviting USO where June Haver and Joan Leslie wear a lot of lace doilies or whatever, as well as lavender wigs. Washington sends MacMurray to spy on the enemy - German Hessians with red lacquer, not British. The Hessians are stuck in a tube of beer and sing a very amusing song that extols the virtues of the Vaterland, "where the white wine is brighter / and the Rhine from the Rhine water / and the bratwurst is softer / and the yellow hair is more yellow / and the frauleins are yolk / and the goose steps are more cheerful. "Something like that. The characterizations are fabulous, as good as those of Sig Rumann. Otto Preminger is the suspicious and sinister Hessian general. "You know, Heidelberg, vés have 241 against 1 against you - but vés are not afraid." <br /> <br /> I can not go on too long with these fantasies, but they are all very funny, as are the lyrics. When he wants to be in the navy, MacMurray throws himself on Columbus and the fantasy is presented as a great opera. "Do not you know that sailing west meant / an extremely expensive investment? / And who do you think provides the means / except Isabella, Queen of Queens." When they see the New World, someone notices that it looks awesome. "I do not care what it looks like," Columbus mumbles, "but this place is going to be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> Anyway, everything is finally settled, even if the genie is at that moment Drunk with MacMurray joined the Marine Corps with the good girl. <br /> <br /> I made it too cute, maybe, but it's cute. Kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the old-fashioned love story. Adults will enjoy some of the most difficult elements in history (who are the Hessians?) Unless they graduate from college, in which case they may want to stay with the rest of the day and say : "Wow! Great!"
