The first thing you encounter when you study fascism is ostracism: as this "philosophy" is false, it is necessary to use scapegoats to evaluate "thinking". The film Ettore Scola, probably his masterpiece, focuses on the excluded, scapegoats of the regime. <br /> <br /> Of the historical event (alliance of Hitler and Mussolini), we will see almost nothing: some military marches, some garlands, dispersed voices .. Our two heroes are not invited to the feast of virility. "Genius is essentially masculine": this is the golden rule that Antonietta (never the best Sophia Loren) embroidered on her cushion; Antonietta, whose world is like cooking, whose pride is his offspring. At the beginning of the film, she is a victim She thinks she should be happy. Gabriel, on the contrary, is politically aware, he is aware of cancer that destroys his country inexorably.But as a homosexual, he is not a further, he is about to be arrested. <br /> <br /> Forgetting all that separates them, they realize what they have in common and they make love. It is an act of rebellion, especially for Antonietta, to become an adulterous woman in a country where politics and religion combine to repress women as never before leads to a kind of political consciousness. One of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio. <br /> <br /> Expect the unexpected and perhaps a doctrine that the human being, his intimate personality, will see that his days are numbered.
