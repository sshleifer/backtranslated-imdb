There is a feeling, in part, of the perceived need to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable for a 1950s movie audience. <br /> <br /> The film begins by some very amusing descriptions of the upper class bureaucrats who run the Foreign Office - the British are looted in the way that only the British can pamper themselves. But after that, the movie gets lost in a conventional fancy plot. Terry-Thomas is observable as always, but the great talent of the cast (Peter Sellers, and others) is largely lost. <br /> <br /> An entertaining film, but not great.
