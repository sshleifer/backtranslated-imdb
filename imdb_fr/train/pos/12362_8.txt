I will quickly address the film's aspects here: it was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities of devouring passions; an Italian girl who can not connect emotionally with her jailed politico-radical fiance (partly because of her apolitical attitudes and her free approach to life) finds comfort and passion in a new lover with whom she engages in an explicitly sexual relationship. The worries, the rage, the tenderness and the passions that swirl in the atmosphere of history are at the height of the calm without passion that seems to engulf the two main characters. This gives the film a disturbing atmosphere that permeates all the political conflict that is otherwise lost to the viewer (unless you have a thorough knowledge of Italian politics in the 80s). I found the film compelling ... which has somewhat ruined the scene is a scene of free oral sex that the actress performs on the main male role ... it is not simulated and leaves little to imagination. There are other sex scenes in the film that I feel are necessary because they describe the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the scene of oral sex, it seems to me, prevents to focus on the real story. Until then, the navigation was fluid and once the infamous sex scene appeared (which caused a lot of ruckus in his day), it's like a roadblock. It is shocking and useless and I am in the camp who thinks the film would not have been hurt if the scene had been removed. And what's unfortunate is that this particular scene will dissuade people from watching this fascinating film, which deserves in my opinion to be viewed because there is so much going on under the surface, emotions and other things disorders are superimposed in the subtext. <br /> <br /> Overall: Wonderful film hindered by a very useless sex scene.
