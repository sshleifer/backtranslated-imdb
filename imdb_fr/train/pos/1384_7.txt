Also known as "Water Lilies", this film tells the story of two girls who embark on the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and it works very well. This gives a lot of time and space to get to know the different characters and to attach a little to them. <br /> <br /> The use of a small cast puts extra pressure on players who play, as they all have more time on the screen. than normal, but the people who play in this movie are doing well. Everyone is completely believable. The visual setting is excellent, especially the underwater shots in the pool add a nice effect. <br /> <br /> Many films have been shot on the same subject and this one does not really stand out. He pulls some "standard" pressure methods from the top hat and uses them. It's not bad, not at all, but it's probably not great either and I think it could have been better if it had taken less explored angles. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
