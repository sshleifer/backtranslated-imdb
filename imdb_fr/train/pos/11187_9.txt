Pet Semetary (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved into the small town of Ludlow. The family includes a father, Louis, a mother, Rachel, a brother, Gage and a daughter, Ellen. They are welcomed with kindness by Jud Crandall. Jud is 89 years old and could tell you the whole story of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> Behind Creed's new home, there is a path leading to a pet cemetery. When Ellen wants to go see him, Jud voluntarily takes the family on a trip. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's Cat Church dies. Jud think Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat. He suggested that Louis follow him further along the path, in front of the cemetery of domestic animals. <br /> <br /> Jud told Louis of this burial place, once used by Micmac Indians. Louis buries Church without the help of Jud. A few days later, the Church comes back alive, but from hell. <br /> <br /> This film is one of two horror films that could scare me apart from "The Exorcist". The greatest performance would ever be Zelda, Rachel's sister with meningitis in the spine, or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help the Creeds make the mistake of bringing things from the dead. <br /> <br /> The music of this film The film plays an extravagant role. It is both sad and mysterious. It goes perfectly with the film. <br /> <br /> 9/10
