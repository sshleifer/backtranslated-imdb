*** I might not see this as a spoiler, but I'd rather be careful rather than careless *** I had never seen this movie when I was little. I fell in love the first time I saw her with my three-year-old daughter. I can watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> For the small role Ilene Woods played in her lifetime, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very attractive; very believable. The music really suits the movie perfectly. The game was great; loved the mice !! You really hated Lady Tremain and the half-sisters; they were just awful. The cartoonists have very well described the messy behavior. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, especially if you like love stories. My daughter saw the movie about 25 times and remains excited at the end.
