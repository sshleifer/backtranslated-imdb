I can not say if the British comedies from the Second World War produced at Ealing Studios are an acquired taste or not, but I am completely dependent and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best. No need to enter the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the slingshots and arrows undergone by the idealistic na√Øve Sidney Stratton in pursuit of his vision in polymer give way to a comic delight. Many well-known faces from the world of British actors - the nervous Cecil Parker, the sneaky sublime Michael Gough and the unscrupulous Ernest Thesinger - have presented superb performances. Guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and Joan Greenwood is delicious like Daphne (just as she states the word "Daddy", the entire movie is worth the detour). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
