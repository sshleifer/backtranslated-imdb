The film shocked me. Personally, I had a rather voracious flock. Finally, after owning the DVD for months, I made it poop a sleepless night. although the film dragged on, the extra movie was purposely used by the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from the addition to the game would have been less realistic if he had left no scene. The best thing about the movie is its consistency with the relationship. No ex appeared or any character threatened the relationship. I mean, typically we see the girl meeting a boy with an amazing fate, they go out with someone, something we saw coming breeze and they get together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this film did not follow this mold. We experienced the relationship and its flaws, and although the characters had moments of anti-love, they did not have a dramatic break when they were guilty and did a montage every 15 years, then found themselves in love again. I did not think the movie was as predictable as the rest of the love movies. The story was unique and true to reality in the way I felt that these people in the film were the most credible I've seen in a romantic film of the modern era. at the current world series, so fate has started here too. It's not "my beautiful lady" but it's a lively and honest film. I will just say that I like it.
