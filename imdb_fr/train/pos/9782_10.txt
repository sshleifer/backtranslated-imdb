Peaches is really a wonderful movie. I write this to refute a review of someone called 'Auscrit', who appeared on this site. First of all, the idea that Monahan's first film, "The Interview," is, in a way, television is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that has been widely acclaimed around the world and is simply one of the best Australian films ever made. He deserved to win the best picture. Peaches are a courageous, bold and courageous start. For me, it works at all levels and I've seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker who demonstrates great skill and sensitivity. For Auscrit to declare that it is another TV movie, etc., and that Hugo Weaving is not good, he does not "understand" the film. Or more particularly does not want to get it. Frankly, that's the kind of comment you expect from another jealous or bitter filmmaker, or both. Or someone from the distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy industry. Your average bettor, I just do not write comments like that. I noticed other comments on the site and a reference to the movie Sommersault. One has to wonder what people think they are watching. Unfortunately, in Australia, at the time of the release of SS, the boost was launched. If you did not like that, there was something wrong with you, not the movie. This manipulation of the media is quite common below. The reality is that the only similarity between the two films is that they are rights of way. Unfortunately for me, SS is a movie about nothing, that could have been told in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional film about anxiety. Fisheries in comparison is a centerpiece. Personally, I can not wait to see what Monahan will do next because he is clearly ahead of his contemporaries in cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all the AFI and FI awards this year, it is a rigged game. As for Auscrit, find something more constructive with your time.
