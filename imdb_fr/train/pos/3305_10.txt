Without a doubt, this film must be one of the biggest ........ of cinematographic history. I've watched it all too often, and every time it's like I'm aiming for the film for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where do we start? <br /> <br /> The center of Meena Kumari's performance is undoubtedly one of the best of her career, closely followed by Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam and Phool Aur Pathar. Each movement and nuance of her performance is meaningful to another Bollywood heroine. His masterly rendition of Kathak, coupled with his grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic interpretation of Urdhu, is unlike anything ever on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; photography, sumptuous cinematography and staging are so full of symbolism and meaning that the viewer remains out of breath. <br /> <br /> Naushads' music is unmatched, her knowledge of the gharanas courtesan's music is incredible and her punctuation of the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice to those who seriously love the spectacle of total cinema should be watching this epic mediation of life and art.
