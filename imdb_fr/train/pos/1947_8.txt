SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the end was a bit steep. I would have liked to see the crew adjust to life on earth after his return. I suppose the writers anticipated this problem by "loading" some sequences of Voyager on Earth at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, this timeline has been removed, so it's all theoretical.) I liked the way Admiral Janeway died for Voyager's crew. As fans, we get our cake and eat it, asking Janeway to make the ultimate sacrifice and survive. I admit that the scenes of conversations between Janeway and her eldest were strange and could have easily crossed the finish line in the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (s) was successful.
