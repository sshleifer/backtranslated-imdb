Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series that takes place in post-apocalyptic Seattle, centered on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically enhanced young woman, on the run from her creators. <br /> The Dark Angel universe absorbs (not as much as Buffy, but absorbs anyway) with an interesting and credible character set. Certainly, it's not for everyone, but those who leave it will end up watching one of the most enjoyable series of the moment. Dark Angel is underestimated and underestimated criminally. It was unfortunately canceled after only two series. Which was a shame, because this series had the potential to become a big series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of Red Dwarf, a long-running science fiction comedy. Dark Angel remaining unfinished, look for him and, if you want more, put pressure on Fox to make another series.
