The French Naudet brothers did something that no one else did, they had a video camera the day this tragedy occurred. They were in Building No. 2, where you could see papers falling adrift, people hitting the ground after jumping from that height. the camera was still running, when the white dust covered them, they found a store and came in, but all these pictures are real and I think they did a fantastic job in capturing them for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary film that I watch every September 11th so I will never forget what this country has gone through. I believe that, if I remember correctly, it shows the first death of the firefighter priest when he was brought to the church and his honorable funeral.
