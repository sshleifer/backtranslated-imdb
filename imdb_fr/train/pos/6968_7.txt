Just as the new GSO was not what fans of the original series expected, Caprica might not offer what fans of the new GSO were waiting for (for the most part). It's a very interesting show, if not a little self-involved, or at least the pilot is. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for the thrill of (new) GSO in CGI, you'll be deeply disappointed. If you liked the drama, you will probably find something that you like and that you can even identify with. <br /> <br /> The plot examines how the Cylons were developed, why Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society. . Writers are also able to attack humans who "play God" and create or re-create "human" life. It will be interesting to see how that goes. <br /> <br /> I found it too long in some parts and too predatory in others, but overall it was promising. A small part of myself wishes (or hopes) that there may be some minor traces of BSG (aside from the previous story I mentioned), but that would probably have complicated the plot too much. Like BSG, I'll have to wait to see if Caprica pushes on me, but it's too early to know. <br /> <br /> It would be really easy to say that this is a failure if we compare it to the previous series, but I am ready to give it a chance. Overall, I thought it was interesting enough to allow me to see how the current show went before "throwing the towel (proverbial)".
