It was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.V. that I would have liked to capture forever in VHS. Will it never be broadcast again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was unsustainable. I want to see everything again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not have. Not even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> This is how it was one of the best series of the 80s. It should be considered a classic but is lost in space. At least this site and Wikipedia mention it. Sob. <br /> <br /> It was very attractive, funny, naughty and original. Perhaps not like Sherlock Holmes' original, I actually think Quintin is much more attractive and has better odds with his leading wife than Holmes would, stiff and chalky.
