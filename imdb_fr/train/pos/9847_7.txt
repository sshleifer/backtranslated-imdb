I had a lot of fun watching this movie .. despite the feeling that I often received, that this film almost copied Monsters Inc. There are a lot of things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child, other animals trying to break this relationship, etc. It was like that throughout the movie, for me. <br /> <br /> One of the redemptive devices however is Scrat :) Very very funny, even if it is useless :)
