This movie is very funny. I recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends. I did it last night and it was fascinating to see how much Norma Khouri could attract everyone in his world! I felt a bit strange watching my friends cross the same roller coaster as the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a good movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie talking about the movie! <br /> <br /> Once I saw a rogue almost at the level of Norma Khouri, but there was none that sounded the same size. He duped very gullible and rich people to my old Berkeley CA A.A. group where everyone relies on others. He would "sponsor" only people who seemed to be doing very well. Who would have known that he stole more than $ 100,000 (in 1987 when it was real money) after being in town for only one month. His victims were very fragile because they were in their first month or their first week of sobriety. He was perverse with a big laugh and a big smile. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned crime is in no way comparable to what Norma Khouri did to her former neighbor. But I do not want to reveal anything. <br /> <br /> I just found this evening on a late-night movie channel, "Showtim", I think. It's always the biggest experience for moviegoers to be totally inspired to see something and make you lose your mind. Just drag your friends to see this and do not tell them anything. It's a very entertaining movie, it's fast moving and never boring. <br /> <br /> This should be an international classic for all time. I think all the big movies end up at the top. The weather will be very good for this movie. I'm just sorry that no one has heard of it yet, which makes the surprises even better in some respects. <br /> <br /> The director and the editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> JUST WATCH THIS FILM!
