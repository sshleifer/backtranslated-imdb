I saw it in a classy movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The screening I attended drew a crowd of African-Americans and made the difference in reaction between the two groups a great social commentary on the state of race relations in this country. Basically, the whites were AFTERLY laughing or laughing nervously at fun pieces - and there are many! - Because they would be "laughing blacks", while blacks also remained quite silent because many could not laugh at themselves in front of whites. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, being Asian (and therefore not belonging to any group), I had a good time watching this satire of rap culture and its ego / trappings / values ​​/ pseudo philosophies. The cast has talent and succeeds very well to become the characters represented. The songs are too funny to believe. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best upcoming pseudo-documentaries, including "A Mighty Wind".
