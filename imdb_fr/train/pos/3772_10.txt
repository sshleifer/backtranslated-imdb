The false course of Bill and Ted is possible. This is the most excellent movie I have ever seen. Although acting and sets, etc. are mediocre, it does not matter. The story is brilliant and the jokes and words they find are excellent, ideas too. I recommend anyone to see this classic. The best part is obviously when they die 'Melvin', I cracked for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. It's so much better than the first, which was also excellent. Perhaps the funniest movie of all time !!!!! However, I think the best parts of the movie are when Bill and Ted shout very well and play the guitar solo, it was hilarious. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, release a 3rd film !!
