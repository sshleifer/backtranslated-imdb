On rare occasions, a film appears that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is such a movie. I got "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film industry. She watched him a second time with me. We were both fascinated. It's like it's the first time. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magic piece designed to send you back when all your dramas have started. He does it while being entertaining relentlessly. The acting and the pace of Bret Carr as a director do not allow you to look away from the screen. He creates a character who disarms with a rabbit like an insect, stammering innocence, but warmly carried with such a discreet sincerity that you forget that you are watching a movie. When the epiphany hit during the climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach, I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must" for life coaches and anyone looking for their own personal growth and transformation. . It's a brilliant and creative masterpiece that has the power to change lives!
