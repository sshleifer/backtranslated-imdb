I have known Bettie Page for many years now. Her soft-core porn images dating back to the 1950s have become iconographic and still have a strong appeal even today. The "Bettie Page" look is also still very popular in the fetish world and remains as distinctive as it is today. So I watched this movie with a bit of familiarity to start. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was extremely fun to see the film's reenactment of real characters like Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager ?? all consider the pioneers today. Mary Harron did a great job in creating the desired mood of sexual repression and hypocrisy in America in the 1950s, as well as a sexuality that by today's standards was innocent to the extreme. I especially enjoyed the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shortcut to the emotional and spiritual climate in which Bettie found herself. <br /> <br /> I think that Gretchen Mol did a great job in presenting the character of Bettie in all its states. innocent sexuality and all its naivety. Bettie loved to look pretty, adored attention, saw nothing wrong with nudity, and dressed in "ridiculous" outfit for the camera. Underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires, all that was evoked was completely lost for her. To this day, she still does not understand "what is this story all about" her pictures or S & M content. <br /> <br /> That does not mean she's not educated or too simple to understand is simply that she simply does not understand fetishism and never did. No harm there. Bettie Page is just to be who she is. The film captured this scene very well. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s described by Mrs. Harron and written by her in the company of Guinevere Turner makes me really happy to live in the time I live. Hypocrisy and repression combined with massive ignorance of our sexuality have combined to create a dreadfully stifling world. The film captures that and inspires enthusiasm while Bettie endures all of this with her unwavering faith and immovable naivety. <br /> <br /> This film was sometimes a little slow, but it touched all the points that Mrs. Harron tried and hit. good ones. I would recommend this movie even to people with little or no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and its effects on American culture. For those who have such interests, then this movie is a must.
