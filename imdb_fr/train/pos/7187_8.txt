The series are short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film linked to serial fiction in a pulp magazine. Known as "chapter reading", these are extended animated movies divided into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes". Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for a week. The series would end with a cliffhanger, because the hero and the heroine would find themselves in the last perilous situation to which he could not escape. <br /> <br /> The public should come back next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and face the villain again. The soap operas were particularly popular with children, and for most children in the first half of the twentieth century, a typical Saturday movie included a chapter in at least one soap opera, as well as cartoons, newsreels and two feature films. <Br /> <br /> The golden age of serial publications is 1936-1945. It was one of the best of the time. <br /> <br /> Zorro has been seen in many movies, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was excellent in his role. <br /> <The action is constant and we are directed chapter by chapter until the end, where we discover the identity of the perpetrator. <br /> <br /> Zorro triumphs, as he always does.
