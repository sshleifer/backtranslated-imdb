A surprising rent in a local video store, I had the pleasure of finding a media satire worthy of challenging Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". And almost as disturbing. I think it worked well with my viewing of being in late 2004 watching the Republican machine do its magic on the majority of American viewers. This raises the question "Are we really so manipulative?" <br /> <br /> This definitely distorted my view. There was also a greater theological question provoked - the story of Christ. Word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something operating that television produces a messiah? Could the story of Christ be exaggerated? Would it have been completely made? This is something that the film puts in an extremely perceptive light.
