It's a very, very early cartoon Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in transition - he is not drawn as long as he was later and his voice is not quite right. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a poor sap who buys bedbugs at a pet store - he has no weapon or desire to blow up the rabbit! However, despite this, the film remains very pleasant. The first insects were certainly more impertinent and cruel than his later incarnations. In later films, he played with Elmer, Sam Yosimite and others because they started - they played with the rabbit. But, in this movie, he looks a lot more like Daffy Duck from the late '30s and early' 40s - a fool who loves to irritate others !! A true "anarchist" instead of the hero of later caricatures. Although it's not one of the best caricatures of Bug Bunny, it's really fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much it has changed over the years.
