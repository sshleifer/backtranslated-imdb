David Lynch usually makes films that look like riddles. They are interesting to watch and think, but they do not really freeze in your mind. Maybe art will always have meaning for its creator. <br /> <br /> Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. In any case, they are not typical. It's an odyssey across rural America. A journey into real life Alvin Straight took a lawnmower to visit his brothers. He traveled 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, will make amends to his sick brother for past faults. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this film is Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight directly to us in a simple and honest way. The slow rhythm of the film corresponds to Alvin's slow progress towards realization. <br /> <br /> In the process, Alvin meets a confused and frightened girl. She is pregnant and decided to flee her situation. After listening to Alvin talk about her family, she goes back on her decision. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin sees a frantic woman killing a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several people and is leaving. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook expensive meat that night. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin's lawn mower loses its brakes and almost kills it. A kind man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he was repaired. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, well played by Sissy Spacek, who is haunted by a terrible tragedy of her own past. Alvin insists on paying the call. The man even proposes to lead Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin refuses with thanks. <br /> <br /> While Alvin is waiting, he also goes to a bar with a nice old man to discuss the harshness of the war and the price it took to their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake as a sniper who has haunted him forever. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two bickering brothers who have repaired his lawn mower. He tells them about prices, calling them wisely for their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate each other by learning from his mistakes with his brother. <br /> <br /> The night before Alvin left the man's yard, he pulled off his hat. The man told him that it was an honor to let him stay and asked Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. It's sincere because it's so simple, so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can not help but get more and more involved. We want Alvin to join his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know that this world is full of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> It was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can not help but understand his pride, listen to his wisdom and feel his pain. One becomes as involved with him as the man who offers him to stay in his backyard. <br /> <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, then Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth are sitting together in a bar. I can imagine them discussing their lives, their regrets, their hopes and their joys. As Alvin says in the movie: "My brother and I used to watch the stars." Well, I know they all have the best view of the house.
