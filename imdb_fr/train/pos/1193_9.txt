The memory of "The Last Hunt" has been engraved in my memory since I saw it in 1956, at the age of 13. It was a film that was a step ahead of others as long as it addressed the treatment of natives, the environment, and the ever-present contrast between the short and long-term effects of greed. It is as relevant today as in 1956, a cinematographic discussion of the highest depth and the greatest relevance. To top it off, the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent. The memory of this film will be with me until the end of my days.
