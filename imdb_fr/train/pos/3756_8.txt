Directed only ten years after the events and placed in the Bunker under the Reichstag, Pabst's film is captivating. He stinks of the sulphurous death awaiting the perpetrators of the world war. I have not seen this for more than three decades, but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory. The characters seem to wait to be walled in their cave. A little dialogue between two generals: "Does God exist?" "If he did, we would not do it." Too bad that it would not be easier to expose or buy because it would be interesting to see and compare this film with the documentary on Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" (aka "Blind Spot: Secretary of Hitler") and "Downfall "with Bruno Ganz.
