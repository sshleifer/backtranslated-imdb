BABY FACE is one of the best "forgotten" movies before the code. It aired last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, which allowed me to watch the film as it is now, with over four minutes of restoration. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where she may have known the drunk parents of "Myra" - Mae Clarke - in the WATERLOO Bridge). His father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with him since the death of his mother and (in the re-established dialogue) he has been making her up since the age of 14. Now she is a resident waitress and part-time prostitute, her closest friend being Chico (Theresa Harris), the African American maid whom Barrett continues to intimidate. One of the two strengths of Stanwyck's personality is that she keeps standing up to her father about Harris, threatening to leave if Harris is fired (and since they are stupid workers like Nat Pendleton, who like to see Stanwyck serving them, Barrett must obey him.) <br /> <br /> The type who regularly frequents the speakeasy that Stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier). who sees great potential in this witty girl if she just leaves her abandoned at home. He also defends the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche and the idea of ​​the will to power. More information about this later. <br /> <br /> After eliminating the local politician (Arthur Hohl) and arguing with him, a still-dead explosion killed Barrett and allowed Stanwyck to leave his hometown. With Harris, she travels to New York and manages to be transported free by freight car sleeping with a brakeman (James Murray). They arrive in New York and after walking around, they see the Gotham Trust Company (established in 1873), and the friendly guard tells him where the staff office is. <br /> <br /> We are slowly watching Stanwyck climb the corporate ladder up, similar (but lighter) than Robert Morse ventured into HOW TO SUCCESS IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING. But Morse was a man in a business dominated by a man. Stanwyck knows that his sexual appearance is his weapon. It goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (a section of the film that I always felt was the most shocking - oddly enough - when I looked at it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and finally George Brent. Each ends up falling for her and is put aside when it no longer serves, or destroyed by it. Brent, the new bank president her grandfather founded, ends up marrying her - and the film's crisis comes when the bank's economic situation is turned upside down (especially after Brent bought her a fortune in jewelry and giving him valuable links). Brent is charged. Will she defend it? <br /> <br /> THE SPOILER TO COME: <br /> <br /> What is not admitted in these films is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated ends. Stanwyck had taken the boat to Europe, abandoning Brent to his fate, but realizing she could not do it to him, returning to their apartment and realizing that he had shot himself in the back. She goes with him to the hospital at the end. Now, before the recovered images are found, the film ends with the film, which apparently would have returned all the money to the bank to save him and would retire to East St. Louis to live happily if he was poor. <br /> <br /> of these are good ends. Stanwyck should continue on his destructive course, with Brent the last of his victims. But even without Breen's office, the writers (one of them is Darryl Zanuck, by the way) have seen fit to let her find a moral center. She does not have one, at least not for powerful men (whom she hates). I do not think a depressive public would have tolerated this type of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems related to the changing styles of public opinion and society. It was a world of men in the business world in 1933, so Stanwyck has some work to do. Wood (when she is fired for indiscretion with him) admits he did not want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck would have found a woman everywhere. In the film, Stanwyck made some ugly remarks (based on jealousy) of other secretaries and female employees at his rapid rise. In 2006, she would often face senior women and find them very quickly cut to the legs. Of course, if she discovers that one or two lesbians are lesbians, she could go down this road but it is doubtful. And she never seems to meet homosexual men either. They have gay executives in business, who make fun of their legs and breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there's his mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg is redone in the "bowdlerized" version trying to get her to seek a moral center. In reality, it pushes Nieztsche, but the way (in a broader sense) that the Nazis pushed Nieztsche - find your way to power and push it. Although Nieztsche sometimes insisted on power, it was not the ultimate goal of his theories. Otherwise, no one would read it today in college classes. Cragg is obviously self-taught, but only half-educated. In short, if someone who was thoroughly studying Nieztsche confronted Cragg, he would make him look like an uneducated idiot. And he's Stanwyck's mentor! A good movie, and for his day is worth 10, but seriously flawed.
