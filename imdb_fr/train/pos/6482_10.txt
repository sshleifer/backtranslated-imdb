I had just turned thirteen when I saw this series for the first time and I watch it again, on DVD, more than thirty years later. The images on the opening credits never left me. It affected my vision of the world and its people. My parents were with me long enough to have seen the show with me and we always discussed the program afterwards. It gave me the taste to study the history and the highest marks I got in the public exams of our school! <br /> <br /> The voice and performance of Sir Laurence Olivier are timeless and perfect. I have the impression that those who lived it would have the impression that it is their version of the history of the Second World War. I can not imagine that I miss looking at him. Perhaps we could now consider a similar series of cold war, but it is hard to imagine who could replace Sir Laurence. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
