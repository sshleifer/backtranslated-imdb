Most people who have seen this movie think it's the best movie ever made. I do not agree but this film is really very good. Tony is a bad guy and knows he is intimidating and uses it to move forward. He talks about himself and how he goes from dishes to a huge house and a desk with cocaine all over the office. If you want a family film, then it's not the way to go, but if you want gangsters, revenge and things like that, then you'll love it.
