This 1939 film was trying to capitalize on Michael Curtiz's much better film "Angels with Dirty Faces". As Ray Enright put it, the only interesting thing is how these children were tamed in relation to what is happening with the young people of the inner cities of the United States. <br /> <br /> This film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they were well paired. The children of Dead End have more important roles because the plot focuses on them rather than on older people. <br /> <br /> In a way, it is curious to see how the arson was used in the same way that some scrupulous owners did it later, right here. At New York. It was the fastest way to transform a property without ever considering the social problems it created. In the current climate with so many guns, there is a new reality. The young children of history seemed like jokers rather than criminals. As times change!
