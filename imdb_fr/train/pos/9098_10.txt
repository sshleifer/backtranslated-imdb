The national import was a good movie. I laughed all the time. It was funny on many levels, from crazy outfits to hilarious situations. The game was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and everyone else did a great job. As this is an independent film written by a writer for the first time, it does not have the clich√©s that are expected of other comedies, which was such a relief. It was unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heartwarming story. I heard it was based on a true story? If so, it's hilarious (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
