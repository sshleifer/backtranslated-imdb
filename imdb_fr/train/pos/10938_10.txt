I rarely meet such a fulfilling film that I have to talk about it immediately. This movie is certainly one of the best entertainment available and it is extremely authentic. I have seen the dubbed version, but I am taking the DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. Nevertheless, the dubbing did not bother and sometimes gave a funny humor: "The clan of Poison cradles the world !!!" <br /> <br /> The narrative remains true to Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense and interpersonal relationships. You can expect twists when the identity of the five venoms is revealed and at an expert rate. <br /> <br /> Martial arts combat choreography is unique and should be seen as such. It's like watching real animals fight, but built from their own forms of arcane martial arts. Such a level of skill among actors is unmatched in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination provides a serious dose of the old Chinese culture and I recommend it solely on the basis of the true intention of the film to tell a martial story. history of the arts and mastery of its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people bludgeon, with raw forms of ancient Chinese tortures, be my guest!
