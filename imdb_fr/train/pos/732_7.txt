Well, I finally caught up with "Rock 'N' Roll High School", almost 30 years after his first sensation in midnight movies in 1979. (I'm Latecomer, I'll probably first see the new documentary from this summer "Patti Smith": Dream of Life "around 2040!) And no, the film does not feel old-fashioned, and yes, it was worth the wait, it's a very energetic comedy that contains tons good music and amazing moments, it tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by PJ Soles, and the battle where she and her classmates in Vince Lombardi earn a high salary against their new repressive director, Miss Togar. Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies," quite accurately portrays Mary Woronov's performance as an "evil Eve Arden.") The story of a typical teenager against the establishment is reinforced here with absurd humor. (these mice that explode, this giant mouse, the mo Hansel and Gretel nitrates) and really catchy tunes. Riff is of course the # 1 fan of the original punk band The Ramones, and this band airs a dozen of his greatest baker songs during the movie, including five in a breathtaking concert. Indeed, the show Riff dancing furiously in front of "Teen Lobotomy" during this eruption is perhaps the funniest moment of the photo. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later on a street singing "I just want to have something to do," is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I guess, the wet dream of all high school students. Fun things indeed. By the way, the Ramones were one of the loudest bands I've ever seen in concert; I was very amused to see that the DVD of this film has optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks have found these subtitles necessary, I wonder ....
