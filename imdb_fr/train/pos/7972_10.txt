I watch this movie all the time. I watched it with the family from 3 to 87 years old and all the others; They all loved it. This really shows the real scenes of a dog, as well as the love and loyalty of a pet. All simply magnificent. <br /> <br /> It is suitable for lovers of comedy films, tear movies or even pets. <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the animals spectacular, the scenes really thought, and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters is the true and beautifully mixed personalities: Shadow (the oldest, a Golden Retriever) is the wise man, filled with the wisdom and mentality of all dogs, Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy a spiritual side, the comic character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan Cat) This is the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for its owner, the real girly.
