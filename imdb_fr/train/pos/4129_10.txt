It's a cooking competition, Americanized. It will not be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I did not care about cooking, but this show is simply entertaining to watch ... From the intensity put in the dishes by the chef to the clumsy president. Really a good way to spend time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the series for having invited Marc Ecko as judge ... But ... Meh. It's pretty fun to watch and usually the winner deserves the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and I am bitter. John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
