I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House around the age of five and watched it continuously until I was seven years old. Then, I grew up and I thought that Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. Plus, there was also the fact that my youngest brother, who was watching him faithfully for those two years, started to dislike that, thinking it was too "girly". <br /> <br /> Then, every afternoon at five o'clock, I realized it was the 23rd and I got hooked again. Full House made me laugh and cry. It made me understand how good it would be if our world was like Full House plus a mom. I've heard people say that Full House is ridiculous and incredible. But let's look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and hurt each other. The three men who live with girls can sometimes bicker. What's more real than that? <br /> <br /> If the show lifted me when I was on the floor and raised me even higher when I thought I was at the point of being completely happy. I screamed like a hyena during the show and I acquired a massive obsession for Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has now taken that place, but they are literally the cutest babies I've ever seen, they are great actresses and they seem to be very nice people.)
