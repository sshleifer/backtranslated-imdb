Simply a good movie, no doubt. Beautiful story and great performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindi film industry is shameless with Mallika and Co, this film is totally free of vulgarity and therefore doomed to fail in the vulgarity addicted to our Indian society. But the message and the concept conveyed by this film are absolutely superb. One could have avoided Anu Malik (boring copy-cat) and use Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should have given a touch of Gujarati, especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician of the moment and he thinks he's popstar, but it's not the film in which his presence was required. He looks great with the Govinda style songs. I thought good serious music with some good Ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable.
