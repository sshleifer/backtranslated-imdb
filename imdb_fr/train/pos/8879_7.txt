*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> this film still seems very exaggerated, until I remember that my college campus had a former student turned Nazi racist killer, who then committed the suicide too: his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Look for it in the wikipedia - I added some pictures to their article about it. <br /> <br /> it's hard to believe, but that kind of thing really happens. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
