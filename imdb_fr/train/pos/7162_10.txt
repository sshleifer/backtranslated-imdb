It's one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and loved it, but this film develops everything that the book made famous. The acting is fantastic, especially Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. This film has a certain way of telling stories that keep you hooked to the end, where everything comes together for a perfect ending. I also like the way this is directed, going back and forth between modern times and the stories of Stanley's ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for a film, and Andrew Davis does a great job of staging. I really recommend it to anyone who loves good movies.
