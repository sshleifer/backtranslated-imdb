NB: Spoilers inside. This great film talks about "so many" things that have all been successful: time travel in science fiction, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, real-world syndrome, progressive weakening of belief systems, global bioterrorism and nascent love story. <br /> <br /> The ramifications of the twisted chronology of history arouse a host of heated debates - witness discussions within this site; or, in the extreme, see the memoir on www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Phew! Such a temporal significance speaks volumes about the brilliant plot of the wonderful work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker's "The Jetee". This is without a doubt one of the most successful and fascinating films ever made. <br /> <br /> The real genius of the film is to focus on the nasty side effects of time travel in the mind of James Cole (Bruce Willis, doing the best job of his career.) here). His career progresses from warrior gung-ho looking for vaccines to a victim progressively disturbed ?? and back The other part of the story highlights more and more the personal story between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (the wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I like the simultaneous changing / opposing views of these two characters. For me, everything comes to mind in the scene of flea hotel rooms. At this point, James ?? once grasped by an unshakable determination ?? collapses now in total doubt about his own reality; while Dr. Railly ?? the cool and rational scientist ?? finally became madly convinced, after absorbing James' proofs, of his horrible predictions. Her desperation to communicate with James and hang on to the mission shows how far she is from the path. <br /> <br /> Gilliam makes us love these characters, especially by the crescendo of tension that animates them. The balance between the emotional roller coaster and the sci-fi thriller / thriller montage is exquisite. And the denouement at the airport is heartbreaking because we see it so clearly in James' dreams. It's here, right after James decides to leave the mess ?? and fight his madness more than ever? that he returns to the stage and does what is necessary for humanity. See Jose and the gun ?? (Just before that, the references to Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and the change of identity / confusion are brilliant.) This is a film that must be shared by thinking people; it does not only stand under repeated viewings, it requires them. "Twelve Monkeys" is smart, provocative, funny, funny and suspenseful. <br /> <br /> The distribution is excellent, especially since Brad Pitt stole all his scenes and showed great flexibility, like Jeffery Goines, crazy and spoiled. but still the survivor. And there is David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting to see that the film just leaves the viewer his perverse motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the highest praise belongs to Terry Gilliam, exceeding here - barely - his remarkable "Brazil". (Many parallels, of course, especially the lone fighter trying to escape his crumbled environment: inner madness, outer madness.) Every image of this film has its own timbre and tone. The soundtrack is excellent too. <br /> <br /> This is one of the great achievements of the 90s, one of my favorites, which will last a long time.
