Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerously" in this gangster movie made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays her sickly mother, Griffin Dunne is his brother's attorney, Peter Boyle is his boss and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo are among the other stars. Keaton plays the role of a pet shop owner in the 1930s who catches a child stealing a puppy and then tells him, in the blink of an eye, how he became the owner of the pet shop. He turned to flying at an early age to have his pancreas operated on with his mother ($ 49.95, special this week) and started working for a mafia boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the surname "Dangerously" in the gangster world. <br /> <br /> There are hilarious scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a riot since Johnny's hoarse mother needs to be replaced. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very entertaining performance, as does Griffin Dunne, a straight-arrow DA who will not "play the ball" with bogged Borg (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is awesome. Richard Dimitri is remarkable as Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you must hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes him funny is that he does everything with an angry face. <br /> <br /> The film is a little tired towards the end, but it's worth the detour, and Keaton is great as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underestimated when it was released, and like Keaton's other jewel, "Night Shift", you do not hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you will find "Johnny Dangerously" extremely enjoyable.
