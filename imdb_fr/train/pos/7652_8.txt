The acting game - fantastic. The story - amazing. The scenario is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Some ways to describe this film. Yes, it's slow, and it's all about it, but the whole story of their life and the way it's told with the flashbacks launched makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this tragic and haunting story. I read the book on which the film is based. It shed even more light on this story and answered some unanswered questions in the film. I also read the performer's song, which is the other half of Gilmore's story. This film reminded me a lot of the phrase "pierce the other side of the mirror". You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is written by a punk band that wrote a song about what would be Gary Gilmore's eyes (one of the things that Gary gave during a transplant at his death) and when you listen to it, which happens after the last time Mikal saw Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you only had to listen to the song itself. This film opened my eyes that way and many others. I recommend this movie (and the book) a lot, a lot.
