One of the most troubling and tragic periods in American history has begun. The members of the Summer of Love culture, in the late seventies and early eighties, eventually became obsolete tools for love beads and night parties. For those who could not develop their juvenile and sometimes irrational exuberance, it was the culture of Wonderland. A love of drugs and a sense of entitlement associated with a disgust for authority, values ​​and "establishment" is the world the film captures. <br /> <br /> The sixties were a period of revolution and violent change that tore apart the American "house". Once the fighting ended, we all had to face the consequences of the carnage. The characters of the House of Wonderland are icons of the unsuitable seventies; half biker, half hippie, half black, all out. No ideology to express, just a feeling of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing. Ron, Billy and David pretend to be Robin Hood with drugs. They speak of love and behave violently; they take from the rich and sell to the lost; they steal everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and his company are the end result of a strange antimatter collision, such as sex, drugs and rock & roll, when lab technicians get bored and move on . <br /> <br /> The film is skillfully directed and punctuated and captures the frenzied world of drug foes in their element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. This story was told in "Boogie Nights". This is the story of a transient and forgotten era.
