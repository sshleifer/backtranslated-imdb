This is a very strange film directed by director / animator Richard Williams. Anyone who knows about William's work knows it's a bit off-kilter (if not ingenious), but this one takes the cake. <br /> <br /> It contains two unfortunate ragdolls who must save their owner's French doll from a lascivious pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several weird characters along the way. The strength of this film lies mainly in its aesthetic quality; his strange character drawings, his powerful animation and his striking contrast between the sweet and the scary. Williams' brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, diskettes and curses, rather than mere cartoon versions of the dolls, which made her more believable (at least visually). The brilliant animation brings us the wrinkled knee camel, whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end, the silent movie hunt with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, the Greedy. <br /> <br /> The Greedy animation alone is perhaps the most exquisite psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something about this animation that drops your jaw - and every second is something new. Living in what has been dubbed "Taffy Pit", the Greedy is a huge man who gobbles and eats sweets. He sings a song that I can not help but think, but tries to kill Raggedy Ann for his sweet heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I can have about this movie is that there are too many songs. It continually slows down the pace of the movie because there are 16. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones), including "I'm watching, and what do I see?", "No Girl's Toy," Blue "(although they did not need to sing it twice)," I never get tired of it "," Because I love you "and maybe" I'm at home ". The others seem simply useless and are not really incredible to listen to. <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie with strange nuances, but if that's what you're looking for, you will not find better.
