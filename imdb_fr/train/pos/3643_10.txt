In the US, in the spring of 2002, "The Rookie" was released, an end of era was unveiled, a Disney action movie that seemed to be "the best for the end !!!!!". It happened right here in Texas! In fact, the story began in western Texas, as evidenced by a area code on a sign there. It was a high school coach so convinced by his high level baseball team that he decided to become a professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: It was really great !!! !! It was a very good sports film, like the trilogy "The Mighty Ducks". He had also taken moviegoers across Texas from somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso to Metroplex (where I live). I can say because I recognize this stadium (it was "The Ballpark in Arlington;" now it's "Ameriquest Field")! It was nice to see Disney's "golden age" end here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> The golden age of Disney <br /> <br /> 1920s -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with a mouse ... and it all ended with baseball. " (sobs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
