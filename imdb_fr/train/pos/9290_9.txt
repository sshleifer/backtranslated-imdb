This is really not the kind of movie John Wayne is known for. He plays a diplomat, a man who makes things happen through speech and persuasion rather than physical action. The film moves with a discreet realism in its superficially uninteresting story. <br /> <br /> For the more open-minded, patient and reflective, this film is a rich representation of a fascinating part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are two stories that intertwine. The great story is that of an internalized, isolationist Japan and an outsourced expansionist America that clash when their interests are in conflict. The story, small and human, is that of a foreign barbarian (Wayne) and the initial hostility and aversion of a civilized Geisha, turned to mutual respect and love. Human history is a reflection of the greatest history of both nations. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done and all the actors play their role well. The two main roles are interpreted perfectly. John Wayne is excellent in Townsend Harris, finding the right balance of strength and negotiation in dealing with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is also excellent as the title Geisha, charming and charming. The interaction between his character and John Wayne is particularly well portrayed. This is exactly what these two people (as described in the movie) would have behaved. <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. He misses all the pomposity. and is a realistic description of how the events described may have occurred. The characters are real people, not "big" figures of history, consciously. In addition, the clash of cultures and interests is described with great skill and subtlety. Indeed, the confrontation between a traditionalist and traditionally strong isolationist Japan and an emerging and powerful country on the other side of the ocean is best summed up in an exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan and that passing ships can not even land at the port for water. The Baron answers that Japan just wants to be left alone. Wayne's character answers that Japan is at a major crossroads of international shipping and that, if things continue as before, the nation will be nothing more than a band of robbers infesting a major road. A very real summary of how the two countries saw each other in the right and the other in the wrong. The resulting confrontation between two selfish peoples with diverging interests has its reflections throughout its history, a recurring theme that resonates in the present and in the future. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and representation of Japan from the mid-nineteenth century, before the accelerated growth towards industrialization that was to follow later in the century, is excellent. A visual feast and an informative glimpse of Japan's ancient civilization. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend to anyone, fanatic or not, John Wayne, to watch this film if you have the opportunity. Just know it's not an action movie. It is a representation of an interesting place and time of history and a love story of slow life, which (to their surprise) ends up dominating the personal lives of both. main characters. Watch this film according to its merits, without preconceived ideas, let yourself dive into its history and you will appreciate it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> In short, it's an excellent film.
