In the opening scene, the eye patch that wears a desperado named Hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but when he follows Johnny into the pueblo, he carries a scar on his spotted eye. This is one of the many gaps in continuity in this edgy Western spaghetti, but instead of damaging the image, it adds a special flavor to the process. <br /> <br /> Another event occurs when Sanchez goes in his three dead bodies, they must be examined for their identity - "You can not imagine how many fake corpses we have in our city". Immediately thereafter, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) presents himself to collect his bonus with no other poster than that sought. <br /> <br /> As for the principal of the film, Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon), it is presented alternately with its holster. throughout the film, at the right hip and at the hip, after exchanging gun belts with Carradine as a result of the fight. Johnny left for San Margo at the request of his uncle, but will have to avenge his death at the hands of the misleading wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and his brother accomplice Pedro (Louis Vanner). It takes a little time to get there, but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores ever recorded. Regarding this saloon fight, the sound effects of kung fu I like every time a punch is connected. <br /> <br /> Want extra exaggerations in the stories? After the duel with Pedro for the first time, Johnny wipes a small amount of blood on his lip, which he manages to dirty Pedro's whole face. In the same way, when Pedro slams around Pepe later in the movie, he does not cut it, but as Johnny arrives, Pepe's face is covered with blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best of the kind that does not have Clint Eastwood in it. As Johnny, Mark Damon is a reasonably appropriate representative but without the bubbling exterior. Carradine seemed to replace the obligatory character of Lee Van Cleef, without being totally naughty. At first, the exchange of identity between Carradine and Johnny did not seem to make sense, but everything was linked to the end of the film. You knew that every henchman would eventually have his due; to mark everyone's time was part of anticipation. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with Nick Adams character from the classic Western TV channel "The Rebel". In this film, Johnny takes its name from a shooting he once had in Yuma. <br /> <br /> The most unique element in the story was probably related to how she tied things to the perverse Samantha strings backstage all the way through. After shooting Carradine, she quickly retreated before Johnny could take revenge. Still alive, it looks like Carradine is trying to shoot her and miss, but Johnny and Sanchez are quick to find her in the dessert where she dies without water - Carradine is aiming at her canteen.
