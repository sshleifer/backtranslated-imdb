This film is such a nerdy goodness. <br /> <br /> A group of people trapped in an abandoned school. They begin to get killed, they know they are being harassed, so what do they do? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend to find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And to join him. <br /> <br /> And that comes with gore and T & A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the usual slasher of the 80s is a reflection of our vision of ourselves, of how adults see young people, or of how Hollywood sees the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. It is a British film designed to be an American slasher. It's hilarious to see how many times British actors who try to speak "American" unwillingly fall back into their British accents. <br /> <br /> If you like 80s slashers (like Pieces), you'll love this one.
