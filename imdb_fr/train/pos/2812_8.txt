"Silverlake Life" is a clear and direct documentary. In fact, it looked more like a movie at home, and if you want dramatic lighting, see something else. And this is by no means a tearful. But I think it positively. It shows two men who love each other and how being affected by AIDS affects the quality of their daily lives. It is almost difficult for me to say whether it was a quality film or not, because it was so undressed that I had to look for other ways to react. It is an admirable film, in fact one of the most admirable and sincere documents I have ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity, their lives being reduced to the essentials. This gives Hollow-Wood AIDS productions a raw, heartless appearance. These men made this film for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You're my sun" to Mark and says goodbye to him is the real thing.
