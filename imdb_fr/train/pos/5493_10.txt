It's really rare for you to have an inside vision of a media deception that has been so widely dubbed official "truth" and that has caught so many agencies of "news" reporters. In my opinion, this film deserves all the awards of journalism - it is objective (yes!), Courageous and constitutes a real "scoop". It can be without comments, fake scenes or directed questions - everyone, including Chavez, can also make fun of himself in his own words. Filmmakers "alone" had to follow the events and keep the cameras running. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us "How to overthrow a president and sell him as a victory of democracy". It's amazing that they lost in the end - until now. As far as I know, the biggest television channel involved only obtained the revocation of its terrestrial license, it still transmits by cable and satellite. I doubt that George W. or Barack Obama is so tolerant after a coup attempt. But then, they do not have to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that the scam of "Chavez supporters are shooting at innocent civilians" has been repeated so willingly throughout the world reveals how well the so-called "free" bias is established), the media have actually become, or have always been, and more. An important lesson for all who are interested in what is really happening in the world. <br /> <br /> The famous challenge of "objectivity" always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the prevailing view or reveal unwanted facts that accuse "us" - this has been true with the effects of the atomic bomb, the US secret history of the spread of "democracy" in the world or the war in Iraq which, according to Johns Hopkins, has already killed 1.3 million Iraqis, not mentioning the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the United States. And the United States is ready and willing to be more damaging than it has been to the Iranians. <br /> <br /> I am curious to know if the next Khmer Rouge leaders will be judged before the International Tribunal in The Hague, whether It will be mentioned "our" involvement in the support and training of Pol Pot guerrillas in the 80s, after being largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not. <br /> <br /> All the more reason for you to turn to the independent media for balance, if not exposure to fraud.
