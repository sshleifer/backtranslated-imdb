When our local TV channel was first launched, it was filling a large part of its schedule with old British shows. "Lock up your girls!" was properly broadcast, and I was influenced by the first few seconds of the film by a blank tape. The best thing I have ever done. <br /> <br /> The actors are perfectly suited to their characters and bring them a charming life, with the appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will leave you speechless, just like Hoyden and his family). The double meanings abound, the intrigues in the wheels mix and match the characters, hilarious gags at the sight hide in all the scenes and risky comments are made regularly. <br /> <br /> I showed the film to some friends a few years ago, they called the piece "lost treasure", as much for the casting as for the story. To this day, I can crack just thinking about dialogue. If this jewel was to arrive at the exit of a DVD, I would be in the foreground.
