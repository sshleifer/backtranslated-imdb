"GOOD TIMES", in my opinion, is a hit of CBS! Despite the fact that I have never seen each episode, I still appreciate it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. In addition, I really like the theme song. If you ask me, even though I love everyone, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show all along the show. Everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes well designed and the writing still very strong. In conclusion, although we can see it now on TV Land, I strongly recommend you watch it in case it disappears for good.
