I really liked "The revolution will not be televised". It has given me a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they want to be governed. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that in Venezuela, 20% of wealthy citizens have made all decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when their shot has failed; After the interim government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the Ombudsman, the electoral councils and all civil rights, no one took the conspirators behind a barn and shot them dead. They did not even go to jail. The main conspirators live in Florida. And the protection they enjoyed was the "Bolivarian Constitution" adopted by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just the story that bites. Democracy can give you a boost if you let it loose. And in Venezuela, it's cowardly.
