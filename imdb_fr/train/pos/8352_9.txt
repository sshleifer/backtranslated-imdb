This film is a magnificent piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors of the last 50 years. His performance shocks you, entertains, disgusts and charms you while leaving you breathless. This film was shot at the very beginning of his film career and is very raw, but he is still able to convey Depardieu's mastery. A must for any Depardieu fan and by far his best start work.
