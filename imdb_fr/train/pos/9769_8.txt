I liked that. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I am also a fan of Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the madness of dinosaurs. I read for pleasure, but when I feel too stressed or dead, I watch television and movies to escape. Theodore Rex allowed me to do it. That makes it a success in my eyes! I did not even go do anything else while he was running. Whether it is considered "good" or not, it does not really matter to me. And no, I'm not a minor. I am not a fool.
