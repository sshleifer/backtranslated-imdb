I think a lot of people just wrote this as another of Tom Cruise's strange movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is really his own movie. Many people said it was weird. it was not. It was different and confusing but not weird. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. The Truman show is different. Confusing is the matrix or the game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything is logical - maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but that will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the point. This is where the so-called "strangeness" that diverted critics came into play. If they had bothered to "open [their] eyes" as in the original 1997 Spanish film, they would would have seen. And if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to define the "sensation" - that notorious element that many films lack. With songs like The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" playing on the dramatic and emotional climax of the film, it creates a quirky, but surprisingly "just", feel. A wonderful film, in its scenario, its music, its acting and its images, Vanilla Sky is unfortunately a film of superficial movement that critics criticize to appear intelligent. Excellent: A +
