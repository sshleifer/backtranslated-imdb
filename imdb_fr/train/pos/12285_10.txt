Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of the Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that comes from the ruins, becoming a force of abuse and exploitation of indignation, a luxury estate for the benefit of the newcomer, Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his history to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would be Augusto Pinochet (the similarities of Stephen with her are inevitable: remember , for example, this image of the senator glasses that make him a nod to the general to start making the palace). <br /> <br /> Ball August attends an exceptional cast in Jeremy's Jerons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the harsh lesson of life always leads us to almost oblige switch. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these terms: "The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Glenn Close, Stephen's tanned game splint, whose sin, motivated by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love, was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to her like a Clara glove. Endowed with telekinetic, cognitive and mediumistic powers, this hardened woman, faithful to her honest and conservative husband, is an indicator of the character and self-control that we desire for ourselves and for all human beings. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (as a worthy leader of the rebellious Blanca Pedro Segundo, unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard child of Senator , which serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. <br /> <br /> The film is stirring the bowels, we have recreated facts that should never be repeated, but this is still happening absurdly (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that against all , life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and just immortalize Ball August.
