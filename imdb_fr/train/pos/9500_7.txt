I saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a neat movie and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and of course for Mccomb. At that time, I was delighted to watch this movie and from that moment I try to create a VCD of this movie, but I am unable to find it. Huge African lions appear in his film and we will be charmed by the size of these animals and their grace. The whole audience can watch this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving Mccomb force parents to direct this film. It's a nice holiday movie for everyone.
