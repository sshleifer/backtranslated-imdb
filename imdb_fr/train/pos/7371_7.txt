A suspenseful thriller that resembles Deliverance with respect to landscapes and scenery. There are also very innovative filming scenes and good music, although the silly and sometimes seemingly reckless attitude of one of the characters is not suited to the situation, although it is not a major problem. It also raises interesting questions about the accuracy of revenge and the limits of friendship. <br /> <br />
