I was eager to get my hands on this one when I read that Fred Astaire was teaming with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a film with a screenplay by P.G. Wodehouse and Gershwins music. It's definitely worth seeing, but it lacks the consistent quality of Fred & Ginger's films. <br /> <br /> The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor is better. Some actors are really hard to watch (especially the boy and the girl). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but that's what she does in this movie. Have you ever tried standing on one of these rotating discs in a theater? Imagine tap dancing on high heels! She follows Astaire beautifully and adds a lot to the overall quality of the image. <br /> <br /> Many beautiful, especially fun songs are Nice Work if you can get it and Stiff Upper Lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and watch the funhouse dance again as soon as the credits rolled.
