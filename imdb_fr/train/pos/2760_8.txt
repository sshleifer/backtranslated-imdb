All the people we meet influence our thinking, change our habits, a little of this person rubs us. "The eighth day" takes up this theme (compare "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil), expert in business psychology and businessman, meets Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child on the run from Down syndrome. The winning performances of these two actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent where George tells his theory about the creation of the world and where we discover what God created on the eighth day. Some moments in the story are very frustrating for Harry. For example, George who is completely uninhibited requires a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. This is the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene where the Down syndrome group, on a trip to the art gallery, escaped on a bus and crashed in front of the Paradis leisure park. The most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where Harry and George pass a chariot astride the road and where, looking back, George greets the driver brutally. But there are also some sweet scenes, including the impressive use of close-ups - hands feeling the sun, wind and rain, hands raised, hands outstretched and hugging love and friendship. It's the real cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes where George offers to Nathalie, where Georges tightens Harry's head in his arms, where George does not stop asking his dear mother, where George learns to laugh to Harry..I felt in the film a deep message that life is beautiful - the very presence of the grass (did you know it's crying when you cut it?), the trees above the head, the birds singing, the little insects - all the miraculous creatures of nature. They are all there to be appreciated if we lie down (like Harry and George) look around and listen ...... A beautiful movie.
