In 1958, Clarksberg was a famous city of speed trap. Much of the revenue was generated by the Sheriff's department's speeding charges. Those who tried to distance the sheriff? Well, that gave the sheriff a chance to push him off the Clarksberg curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the film, some soldiers on leave who are trying to get back to the base on time are dead, if I remember correctly. Then one day, a stranger went to town. Perhaps the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, as in McCord seals. In perhaps the ultimate hot rod. A blazing Ford coupe '34 black. The colors of death, evil and fire hell. He is taken for speeding by the sheriff. He checks the configuration of the earth. He is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all in favor of the sheriff. There is only one way to get justice for the murder of his brother and to arrange things so that "it will never happen again": recreate the hunt and fully adjust the style of the hot-rodder . He goes to the curve and practice. The sheriff knows that McCord knows it. The race begins ... It is a film that will be remembered by all those who have already tried to master the maneuvers on a certain stretch of road.
