"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate film of the rebel party. Representing a group of high school students who take inspiration from the music of the Ramones to rise up against their main despotic (Mary Woronov, of the fame of "Manger Raoul"), the whole film turns to one kilometer. It's basically a great excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you'll do it. Intimidated freshmen? Check. A dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also of "Eating Raoul" *)? Check. Mice exploding? Checkmate. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these are the kinds of things that make life worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know Ramones' music, it's pure pleasure. With Roger Corman, executive producer and Joe Dante as co-director, how could we expect anything less? Too bad that the director Allan Arkush then degenerated into a title such as "Caddyshack II". <br /> <br /> Featured VJ: Vincent Van Patten, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Miller, Dick Miller The films of Joe Dante, and many Roger Corman), Don Steele and of course the Ramones. A real treat. <br /> <br /> * Looks like Bartel and Woronov have always played the same role. They also shared Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... in which they took over their roles in "Eating Raoul".
