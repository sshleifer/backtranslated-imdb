The pilot of Enterprise lacks one thing since the first Star Trek: a dose of realistic and imperfect personalities. The utopian characters of the next generation got tired, they were so noble that they were incredible. I also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter towards Vulcans. It's funny to see them as pretentious snobs. It makes me anxious to see when humans will become the dominant race between the two, although I do not think it would work during the period of the series. The only negatives that jumped at me were the sensation of "fast end at 2 o'clock" from the end, which is common to many Trek shows. The second was the cheeky dig for assessments by a couple of incredibly sexy scenes. It was not in its place, a good science fiction show should be able to fend for itself without trying to erase the pre-teen audience with a little skin. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, so good. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode will look.
