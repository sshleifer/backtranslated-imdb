Let's start with this theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you are caught between the moon and New York City". It's a great theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tiring. It's really a very good song about New York. Be that as it may, Dudley Moore's great CBE plays the role of a drunken millionaire who is betrothed to Jill Eikenberry's character in the film. Jill would play LA Law later. Anyway, it is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Academy Award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor. Arthur falls in love with the character of Liza Minnelli, who is perfect in this film in addition to his performance in his Oscar-winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza does not sing. She plays a waitress. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as a matriarch of the Bach family who decides the fortune of the family. Be that as it may, she is fabulous and should have been nominated for the Academy of Best Supporting Actress. Barney Martin, better known as Jerry's father on Seinfeld, plays Liza's father. He's great too. The film was well written, played and delivered to the public who wanted more.
