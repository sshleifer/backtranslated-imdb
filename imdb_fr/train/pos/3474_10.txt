This film is worth the trip alone for the exceptional performance of John Lennon by Jared Harris. It does not matter that Harris does not look exactly like Lennon; his manners, his expressions, his posture, his accent and his attitude are pure Lennon. Best scene: Lennon at a local coffee shop chatting verbally with a stammering fan of whether Paul McCartney & Wings' "Silly Love Songs" is worthy of America's No. 1 status.
