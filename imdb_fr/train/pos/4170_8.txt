I have seen this film more than once. It looked like a lot of spooky things that were shown in TV movies back then. The only problem I had was with the title for obvious reasons ... We immediately think of the famous cake at Drake's snack! Leaving aside the first part, "Dog of hell" would have been enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna always manages to be serious about everything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. But it was a good rate for Halloween offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna flew to an obscure country to find the mystic that would help him defeat the devilish beast. He asks the taxi driver how to find this guy. Great dialogue between the Aboriginal taxi driver and Crenna on the fact that the driver dissociates the ethnic beliefs of his people. "Oh, Mr. Barry, I forgot that kind of thing when I came down the mountain ..." - referring to the mystic who seldom sees or counsels people, and no one knows how to actually contact him. <br /> <br /> Regarding the supernatural price, this film is always nice.
