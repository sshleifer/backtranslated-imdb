All those who do not laugh throughout this film have been embalmed. I have watched it at least twenty times and I still have tears in my eyes in many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a soap-felt star whose support group is trying to get her replaced in the hope that their own star will rise. Fields, at age 45, still has this wonderful and beautiful goblin quality and a perfect figure that hides her after having three children. I am biased, I am in love with her. <br /> <br /> The distribution of "Soapdish" is filled with stars who interpret their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, as is Robert Downey Jr., an ingenuous Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her leading roles, Carrie Fisher as overexpressed casting director who audition an actor for a small part as that server without his shirt on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as an unhappy costume designer, and better still, Cathy Moriarty as Nan Nur who leads the plot to make the Fields character disappear is hilarious. <br /> <br /> This film should have won Oscars Best Comedy, Best Leading Actress in a Comedy, Best Leading Actor in a comedy and a myriad of other successes including writing, directing and the support of actors and actresses. Get the DVD so you can watch it again and again for the next twenty-five years. You will still laugh when the disc is worn.
