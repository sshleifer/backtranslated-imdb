When you read the summary of this film, you may come to think that it is a strange film and that in some ways the main character of this film, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé), is haunted by visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle allusions to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is very amusing for the viewer to try to understand the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and some hints at the end of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement all the way through and does not become boring for a minute. This is mainly due to the excellent performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the overall direction of Paul Verhoeven's ensemble. His directorial style is clearly visible and it can be said from different angles that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven film. This will not only seem typical for people familiar with his American films because of nudity and violent graphic scenes, but also for people familiar with his Dutch films, because of the same things and his talent, to tell a great story . . When people watch Verhoevens' American films, could say short-sighted people, he has no talent for telling a good story and focuses only on blood and sex. That's what some people think, whereas I think it's a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in every film. Although it's not a good movie, Hollow Man (his latest American movie) is an example of how Verhoeven can do more than sci-fi movies, and maybe companies should trust him more. offer more movies. He needs that. Just watch his Dutch films. Not only do they show that he needs some freedom, but they also demonstrate that he has a remarkable talent. "De Vierde Man" has brought him closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
