<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is without a doubt the best adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel ever on screen. Always one of my favorite novels, I was extremely satisfied with this TV series. The late Denholm Elliot was perfectly interpreted as the noble John Jardyce, while Diana Rigg was perfection compared to the condemned Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, realizing only minor cuts in the plot that do not affect the story. on a whole film brilliant, moving and atmospheric.
