Amazingly good start of Alfred Hitchcock's effort. One of the only original scripts written by Hitchcock himself, this film presents a remarkable history structure. It begins with a catchy boxing match in which the "One Round" carnival champion loses to a public challenger who happens to be a professional prizefighter. The film then slows down to develop the characters and present a love triangle between Jack, his daughter and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic accumulation of revenge between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this first film, Hitchcock shows his talent for significant cinematography and placement of props. An armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to appear throughout the film as a symbol of his infidelity. The only big critic of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not been perfected in 1927. The last match ends up being somewhat anticlimactic. The story, however, is what brings this film through.
