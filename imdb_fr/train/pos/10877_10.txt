I saw this movie with a group of friends and although we were only two out of the cinema thinking how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented how much it was was stupid. Well, it's because it's not supposed to be taken seriously, it's basically a movie that makes fun of horror movies and does a great job. ?? Well it's Australian and original! Jessica Napier is doing an outstanding performance and Sarah Kants has a bright future ahead of her! I hope to see more. Molly Ringwald was a good shot and Kylie an even better shot. The impossible princess was the queen of the screen! I recommend seeing this movie, because you will guess until the end the connection with Raffy, Hilary and The movie that never ended 20 years ago.
