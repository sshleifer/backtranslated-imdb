THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an elegantly costumed and reproduced piece of history that boasts beautiful scenery. Jean-Marc Vall√©e embodies the faithful version of Julian Fellowes' faithful version of the girl who was to become England's oldest monarch, Victoria. Much of the first part of the film, that of Victoria, is a child whose mother (Miranda Richardson) contests the rise to the throne and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and sets . variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) has reached its majority and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the film blossoms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds this delicate line between the girl's infatuation and royal dignity making her an excellent flagship for those seeking to control the "queen child" at court, including her secretary, Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany). But as she acquires her role as queen, her gaze stretches on the shattering Prince Albert, and a love story that lasts in everyone's memories is associated with the concept of joining royalty with the care of its care. subjects - well deserved to Albert's sensitivity. The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and ends with some statements about the influence of the effect of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on various royalties across Europe! It's a beautiful evening of costumes and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if not carrying the epic. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
