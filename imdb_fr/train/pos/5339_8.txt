I just saw "Behind Bedroom Doors", and it was the first softcore movie with a solid story I had been seeing for a long time. <br /> <br /> We start with two pairs of neighbors - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington) and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian appears to be a housewife, James is a solicitor, Lillian works in real estate and Gabe is a leading plastic surgeon. Do you have all this? Now, let's go in there. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, played beautifully by porn star Chelsea Blue. She rents the house across the Fenways and lives alone. At the beginning of the movie, James looks out the window and sees Abby playing with his girlfriend, Gigi (interpreted by the prolificly pornographic Monique Alexander), and secretly begins to wonder how it would be to live with her. The next day, Abby meets all four and seems to be a friendly woman who simply lives an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass to Vivian, who seems surprised and says: "Oh ... I do not ... I'm not like that." Everything seems to be going for the moment ... until the plan is implemented <br /> <br /> First, Abby shows up naked at Gabe's office, asking Gabe if she should have a job in the breasts. This is where we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe married?" "I am married." "There is a problem ... let me guess, your wife is staying at home and doing everything you ask, but she's a good girl." "Yes." "She's not a bad girl?" "No." "Is this door locked?" <br /> <br /> You know what will happen next ... Abby chats with Gabe, right in the exam room. After that, she rides a little show in her window for James, who comes and does not waste time having sex with her. What James does not know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is actually a camera recording all the festivities (it's so obvious anyway). Abby has sex again with Gabe later, and this time, Gigi joins him to make it a trialogue. Now that Abby has something about the two men, she asks each of them $ 100,000 to buy her silence. Not only could she ruin James's run to power, but she could also destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James fight their guilt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian - who "experimented" with women at college. It was a long time ago, but you would not know that to see her in action with Abby - she looked like an old professional. <br /> <br /> While Gigi accepts the plan, she seems jealous of everyone. the sex that his girlfriend is having. "These are just business," says Abby. Confessions and excuses will surely follow, as well as surprising information about Abby's true identity - it seems she has done the same thing to different men in many places. Gabe and James use this information to fight against Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now, let's go to sex. The sex scenes were pretty good and, since all the women involved in this movie, with the exception of Julia Kruis, have a long experience in porn, I would not expect anything less. The four scenes of Nicole Sheridan were the best of the film, the trio being imminent. Monique Alexander only got naked once, but she was a relatively minor character. Julia Kruis was a major character and was born the same number of times. I guess since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore professionals, she did not need so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> To conclude, "Behind Bedroom Doors" had a beautiful story that improved the overall rating of the film. I consider it a movie worthy of the name. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good in this movie - better than her later offers in Fred Olen Ray's comedies.) At least she can do some drama Chelsea Blue was a Thief of scenes - she was not so mean as the antagonist I would give her an A. Julia Kruis was as usual, I wish Monique Alexander had more time in front of her skin in this movie.) > <br /> Sex: B (Strong, solid sex scenes, Nicole Sheridan's performances were almost of hardcore quality, and Chelsea Blue had a nice appearance in her scenes, but the two girl-girl offerings were not hot, but they warmed up the screen.) <br /> <br /> History: B + (I liked the dialogue and the main storyline.) Chelsea Blue's performance was good for the genre, and I was impressed by Nicole Sheridan's turn in the drama.) <br /> <br /> Overall: B (This was it's a nice softcore movie, I'm happy to have seen this one, I was pleasantly surprised. If Chelsea Blue wanted to do more, she would always be welcome. e. This is also true for Nicole Sheridan - although she is probably better at comedy. I do not mind hardcore girls who can play softcore movies.)
