In the same vein as his Americana Drums Along the Mohawk, John Ford sums up American history in a fictional and yet very believable way. Henry Fonda made three consecutive films at that time with Ford and all three have roughly the time and place, focusing on the setting and the cultural environment. In Mohawk America, pioneering America is in full bloom and Americans are fighting against Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us America of the 19th century; a time when invention and creativity were beginning to flourish and this country was becoming really big. Abe Lincoln, a tall and lean young Illinois lawyer, describes the film as a story of his life as a lawyer, prefiguring the grandeur he would eventually achieve. <br /> <br /> Fonda is superb in this film. the essence of what is considered Lincoln's persona, although no one knows exactly what he looked like then. The sets and the distribution that accompanies them also work harmoniously and give a unique balance to Ford's picturesque dream and its many forms. This film should not be taken literally, but rather symbolically, showing that Lincoln was really preparing for the events of his life that would create his legacy. We even have scenes between him and a young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's not the question. I believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His calm and direct behavior was then rare and would still be so today. Indeed, our government surely needs more men like him.
