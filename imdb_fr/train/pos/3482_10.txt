This is my first comment on the IMDb website, and the reason I write it is that we are talking about ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN THE WORLD! 'Do not goryuy!' will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not yet a fan!) of the Georgian choral singing tradition, and perhaps will you accept the difficulties of your own existence and will you feel yourself well after watching it :) What I like about this movie is that actors in non-main roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character. The movie stars Vahtang Kikabidze (which is awesome), but you will remember every face around him in the movie. You will find yourself quoting their lines, which have become familiar names for so many Russian-speaking people. A movie to live. Simple, but profound, you will want to watch it again and again.
