A common plot in the movies is that the main characters leave behind the hustle and bustle of the city and find themselves in the tranquility of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, two stories of people doing this try to find each other on a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. However, rather than epiphanic moments, we have two characters whose journey into nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this film is slow, contemplative. We learned in the end what really brought everyone to Kangwon Province and we learned how they are connected. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a film to give them a definitive answer, this film will not satisfy. But for those who want a film that lets them think, wonder, affecting them years later, this film will satisfy more than their desire.
