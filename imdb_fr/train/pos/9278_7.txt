In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the other two Jafar Panahi films I've seen, the director reveals a surprising depth in subjects that seem, at first sight, minimal. In Offside, Panahi's seriocomic tribute to Iranian women defending their rights, I do not think he's so successful. Of course, what he says is not important (and it is unfortunate that, like all other Panahi films, Iranians do not see it). But after a while, the movie has become a bit flat and it looks long even at 90 minutes. Do not say that I did not like, though. The actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious. But this is not an important job, in my opinion.
