1985 was a good year for movies - maybe even awesome - but this one missing a gong convinced fans a lot of the fact that Oscar is little more than a hood ornament for good party members . <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: such was the disdain of the Academy for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before prejudices prevent them from giving him the statue before allowing them to give him 7 for Schindler's list, which is probably not as good (and I'm half Polish). Make no mistake, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not hitting 'Out of Africa' (who won that year) either; but it was, in my mind, a class behind it: an epic story of suffering and hope that made me cry - and I'm not a big cryer. <br /> <br /> It was maybe the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more probably simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to us all that she was well more than an actress; Danny Glover, whom I had never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest belongs to the story; but at the time: who knew?
