I saw this movie and even though I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still liked watching him. I would recommend it to other people. He happens a lot on the movie network for life. And I think since it's close to Halloween, they could play it more often. So please be on the lookout if you are interested in watching it. I think Alicia Silverstone played her part very well. I really like her as an actress and a person. She looks so kind and down-to-earth. Kevin Dillon, he was so good. I do not try to hit him or anything but I think his brother Matt could have better shoot this character as a serial killer. Kevin just seems too kind to me. But I think it went well.
