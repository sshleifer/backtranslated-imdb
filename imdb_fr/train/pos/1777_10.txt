When I saw the Romeo division for the first time last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, during later viewing, I had much more than the making of master films. This image has a singular voice that will resonate in the annulments of the film's story. <br /> <br /> The initial montage offers a magnificent palette that the director JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this web of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as a brush to take us on a walk that wraps the audience in an extraordinary action film that goes beyond the traditional format we are used to and delves deeply into the dark themes of the betrayal, revenge. and the importance of fellowship. This film is the dream of any director. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic venture. The writing, provided by scribe Tim Sheridan, was equally breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such a presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!) where Vanessa turns out to be a coalition member and a villain all the time, is written in such a dark tone that she is one of the more frightening. endings that I have never seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In a final note, it is obvious that this production was not a small feat. <br /> <br /> That's why producer Scott Shipley is to be congratulated, who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk beside Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I seen such a big production with so much attention to every detail. A producer job is one of the toughest of all movies and Shipley makes it look easy. <br /> <br /> In total, this film combines creative writing, breathtaking production and masterful direction. It's the art of film at its best. When the end of the film arrives, we do not want that anymore. <br /> <br /> The Romeo Division is a pioneer, a masterpiece and, above all, the Romeo Division is an art.
