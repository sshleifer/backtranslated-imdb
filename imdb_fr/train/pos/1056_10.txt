How can anyone say it's bad, it's beyond me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. The Story intrigued me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Ignore the bad comments and please watch the first season before deciding that it's bad because I know that if you watch the first season, you'll like it and go out, buy season 1 and the season 2 on DVD, then join the campaign for season 3 to be made! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure many of your Dark Angel fans hate them too. They have a thing for Canning Good Shows! You do not all agree?
