The thing about my parents is a fantastic movie about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also this son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is funny, poignant and stimulating. This led me to reevaluate my own relationship with my now deceased father and adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not have been better interpreted. I hope that MM. Falk and Reiser will be recognized in next year's film awards for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his screenplay.
