SPOILERS WITHIN. <br /> <br /> It seems that Trotta was much more comfortable with her balance between personal history and the history of events than in her previous film Versprechen, Das (1995). <Br /> <br /> The management seemed carefully controlled and, visually, I found it to be very attractive, especially with regard to the visual narrative (mix of title and sequence and a new candle in modern times commemorating the death of various characters in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points that have confused many people: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although it may seem implicit, it was not the intention. Von Trotta told me herself! (And she's a very nice woman, by the way!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the calendar of events was in fact historically accurate (the actual dates are shown on the memorial's close-up) and the prisoners were been released as suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence that Goebbels was annoyed to have done so and was considering recovering those he had released. 'over-movied' era. It seems a shame that it took so long (for various reasons) for this film to be shown on our screens. <br /> <br /> Once again, please, Margarethe!
