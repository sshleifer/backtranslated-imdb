You have to dig these holes. Holes leaves only three, which makes a movie so good. Disney did the same again. Shia LaBeouf should be nominated for Best Actor for her performance of Stanley Yelnats. He has already won the Daytime Emmy for best actor in a comedy series (Even Stevens). Holes is one of the best movies of 2003.
