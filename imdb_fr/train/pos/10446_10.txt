I watched this movie 10 years ago. and watched it on video once a year on average. it's the kind of timeless movie, because the themes are universal, but the stories and conversations are so personal. it is also one of the few films that capture you from the first image to the credits, despite the fact that there are actually only two characters (very captivating). it owes a lot to the involvement of the actors Hawke and Delpy, who make us believe that they are in fact Jesse and CÃ©line. it's also the first movie I've seen that mentioned reality TV, and now the phenomenon is endemic! I like the way this film envelopes the audience in its space and makes you think, if you're jaded, that you're one of those characters. it also made me want to take the train to travel across Europe! I did not meet anyone who did not understand this film. maybe it speaks for myself, my friends or just the genius of this movie.
