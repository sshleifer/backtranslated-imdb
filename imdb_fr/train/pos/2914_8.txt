Few movies have been shot on the lighter aspect of aviation (Lighter), but it's one of them and it's good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place during Navy airship operations at NAS Lakehurst (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery plays chief conductor Ned Trumpet, friendly but similar to Munchausen, an enlisted pilot, whose grandiose tales have become so frequent that no one really believes him. Half of the fun is almost at the end of the movie when events begin to prove that most of his wackiest tales are actually true. <br /> <br /> Placed during the Second World War, the main plot is centered around the single Trumpet who woo a local widow end up having a father-son relationship with the crippled son of the widow, Jess. Doctors told him that he would never walk without crutches, Chief Trumpet pulls a few strings and a naval surgeon helps restore the crippled leg of the boy. Jess continues his career in the Navy to become an aviation officer. It goes back to Lakehurst and faces new challenges. <br /> <br /> A movie very well done, even if some Hollywood dialogues do not work. past the technical advisors, and the apparent inability of Beery to walk at the same pace. Otherwise, this film gets good marks in terms of technical accuracy and gives a rare glimpse of the Navy's LTA operations. The scene of the cash register, an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future love interest, Cathy, is an absolute delusion.
