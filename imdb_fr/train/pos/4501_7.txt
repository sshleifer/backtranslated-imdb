This group of English professionals is a pleasure to watch. Supporting actors could form a series of their own. It is an avant-garde triangle between the head of surgery, his wife and a new resident of cosmetic surgery. Only the top acting talents of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and the sexy Robson Greene make it possible to move from the waste category to a very pleasant "boil". The only complaint is that it is hard to accept that Francesca Annis, who is brooding, falls in love with her husband and actually marries Michael Kitchen, who, like me, is hardly an international or even British sexual symbol. . You can easily understand why Robson Green would light his fire, with an apology to the "Doors". The guy who almost steals the show with a great "casual" performance is Owen's father, David Bradley. Look at it in "The way we live now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of ​​its range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometimes a sex toy, is hard to forget as a rejected mistress who makes Kitchen regret having watched her beautiful body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green Chick's buddies in surgery, as I said, could have their own series. They are so good. All this is very funny, and I highly recommend it, and I thank you, imdbman, for letting the customers who pay have their say in this fascinating place.
