I just bought the DVD and I must say that (after seeing Brazil and fearing hatred in Las Vegas), Terry does it again. In addition to being a fan of Monty Python's films, Terry Gilliam embodies the genius of this sci-fi thriller, in which Bruce Willis plays a marvelous role as James Cole, as well as Brad Pitt (perhaps my character favorite), who played the madness of Jefferey Goines. A must for science fiction fans or movie buffs of all types, because it includes suspense, drama, action, and more. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the plot, In the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to annihilate the human race, unleashed in the past by "the army of twelve monkeys ". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in 1996 (the date the virus was triggered) to learn about the disease so that scientists of his time can find a cure. Before I go any further, James Cole lives in an underground society and animals dominate the world on the surface because of the disease that will kill humans. anyway, when he is fired at the time, he is effectively fired in 1990, where he is sent to a psychiatric facility because of his stories of the virus. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is then responsible for the destruction of the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe) who associates with Bruce to save the world (because she sees that he is right), he is returned from his time to the other and finally sent in 1996. where he s then asks about his own mental health but ends up revealing a last quarter of the suspenseful film, then gets closer to the shocking climax, where he tries to prevent the man carrying the virus (not really Brad Pitt) and is shot by the police as the murderer leaves.
