Despite the title The Sword Bearer and the jacket of the DVD (action / hero of The Sword Bearer), it is not a film of superheroes. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) It follows the story of Sasha, The Swordbearer, who is cursed to have a retractable sword in his forearm. Cool you say, but no, it's real life. If you had this power as a child, could you control it when, for example, a mad man is confronted or when your mother's boyfriend beats her. And if you do not control it, how do you do to be a killer twice at the age of 12? <br /> <br /> This is essentially where Sasha is when we meet him. Wandering aimlessly after another murder (a bit like A Bout de Souffl√©). He then meets Katya and the couple immediately falls in love, providing Sasha with a real reason to live and try to change his habits. However, his past still pursues him, in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on the screen, even if a lot is suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood "superhero" movies, we have very little story, there is no villain (unless you count The Sword Bearer himself), but there are a lot of heart and good character development. It's worth checking if you can find it.
