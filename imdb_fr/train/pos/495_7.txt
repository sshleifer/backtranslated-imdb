<br /> <br /> There is a STAR TREK gun - a lot of them. Cannon, we know the story of the future. Technological progress, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> The COMPANY largely neglects most of the ST gun. An unfortunate fact for longtime fans. As such, I imagined that producers would review at least the first episodes of TOS and retro from there - but no. <br /> <br /> Live guns, like much of the technology, have a lot more modern than that found in TOS. An old-fashioned Starfleet laser gun, a slow scabbing effect of gold - that's what I was hoping to see. In addition, I did not expect to hear pure sound effects based on sound signals similar to those of TNG, but far removed from the sound effects of TOS. <br /> <br /> In the first view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military look - some old navy. With ENTERPRISE, we see shocking contempt for rank. There is more military code in the STAR BLAZERS cartoon than in ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> It is good that Captain Archer is not sure of the needs of the Universe (quite different from Kirk who has never failed to trust his application of human justice), but in ENTERPRISE, everyone seems to be equal. Unprofessional, uncertain, more removed from the feeling of formal military service than what is found in the ST series - and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> The opening theme of casual country music announces the journey of a family rather than the adventures of a large major military ship. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE shows us a rather amusing and warm exploration of human relationships rather than leading us to a historical, daring, rocky and rugged exploration of the world. <br /> <br /> I would have chosen Adrian Paul to play captain and an older human to be the doctor. Yet, I liked the actors for the most part. Linda Park, an outstanding ballroom dancer from Boston College, will surely grow well. The characters that make up the crew seem to have been thought. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE starts stronger than the last three STAR TREK series. Let's hope for a good future!
