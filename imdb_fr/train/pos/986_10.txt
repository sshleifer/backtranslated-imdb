If you like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", '01, you'll love his role as a guy who never enjoys an equal life and ends up screwing up Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time time a lot of gold bullion. Alvin Sanders has many FBI observers watching him and gets hit by a brick in his jaw, and David Morse (Edgar Clenteen), "Hack" '02 TV Series, decides to focus on poor Alvin and to use what is called a hook to attract criminals. There are a lot of laughs, dramas, cold-blooded murders, great filming locations and a lot of luxury cars sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was an excellent entertainment throughout the image.
