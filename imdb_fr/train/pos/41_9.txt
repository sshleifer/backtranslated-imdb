"That he has done?" contains many bursts of laughter and gags. It's not only one of Stooges's best films with Shemp, it's one of Columbia's best short comedies. Director Bernds wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered an end-of-career move, it was designed for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released under title "Pardon My Terror".) It was too good for the Stooges to abandon it and the film was finally shot by the Stooges at the end of 1947. <br /> <br /> The old man Goodrich calls the Detectives have Shemp, Larry and Moe for fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive home, Goodrich has disappeared and his niece and various henchmen are trying to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and translate the niece and the henchmen? <br /> <br /> Shemp is particularly funny in this movie. Christine McIntyre's reactions after mickey are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre obviously tries not to laugh! Other fun scenes: the closeup of Moe's cup looking through the lens of the camera; and the fight in the dark with all the cast members involved. <br /> <br /> Nikko the Cretin (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual characters ever portrayed in a Stooges movie. With his hair curled, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he did not dominate the others! "That he has done?" is a jewel among the films of Stooges with Shemp. Even Curly fans will appreciate this one! A real classic Stooge. 9 out of 10
