This film was released the year of my birth and will, like me, 70 years in 2007. I watched it again last night, I had not seen since high school. Although it was full of the feeling of 30 years old and the acting was a bit stereotypical, nevertheless, it was superb. The story of Pearl S. Buck is born from the magic of chemistry Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel that earned Buck the Nobel Prize for Literature comes alive under the direction of Sydney Franklin, who, accompanied by an excellent screenplay, tells the story of the peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father gets for her a wife , a slave of the kitchen. from a local owner. In Buck's story, Wang's success is based on his willingness to listen to his wife most of the time and the love of the land. In the end, he realizes that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, his happiness and his immortality. In Buck's stories, strong women have always been placed at a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. Luise Rainer, born in Germany, gives life to a peasant Chinese hesitant but determined in her portrait of Olan. Similarly, Muni captures the naive but honorable Wang, finally wedged between the two worlds of the rich and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Uncle Henry of Kansan Dorothy Gale in the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly in the role of uncle miaulement complicit and Keye Luke in the role of son number one, but this time not in Charlie Chan's. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie that you can watch over and over again and never tire of. If that's the case, this film is a classic, without a doubt.
