It was usually a good movie with an ideal ending; the game was spectacular and the characters did not stray from their people. I particularly liked the plot, even if you knew what was going to happen, it was an element of surprise throughout the film. However, I see that the end could have been a little longer (perhaps extended). For me, it was as if he had been a little hasty; as if the author was trying to remove the clothes before the rain. For example, what happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? We all know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who organized everything ?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? May be? If there is .. I can not wait to see it.
