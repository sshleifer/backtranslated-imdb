It's a bit crazy, but I recorded on TCM both this German version of MGM's "Anna Christie" and the English version ... but I must first see this one, because I had heard that many people thought it was better than the English version. <br /> <br /> Without seeing the other, I can not compare them, but it's still a great beginner, with a flawless performance by Garbo. She is very beautiful in this movie, her face shines everywhere, especially when the cameraman William Daniels receives these beautiful close-ups of her. <br /> <br /> The film's atmosphere seems different from that of the usual MGM. At that time, it was very similar to the French or German expressionist films of the 1930s. It was made by a great French director, Mr. Jacques Feyder, who had directed Garbo in 1929 in "The Kiss". <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutely believable performance as Anna's sweetheart, this tough and tough sailor who is just a kid in a man's body. Hans Junkermann also gives a very good performance, just like Anna's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel also, as a cheap old floozie. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a unique experience, because it's the only movie where you can listen. Garbo speaks a foreign language ... because all the other films she shot in Sweden or Germany were during the era of silence. <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
