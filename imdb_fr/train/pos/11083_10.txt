Fox Glacier is one of the most heart-wrenching and wonderfully photographed wildlife movies ever made. <br /> <br /> This film makes you love every member of this family of foxes, from the most blind to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes hilarious and tragic. In an inhospitable countryside, the public has a warm heart for family members. <br /> <br /> The score and the lyrics tell the story, interspersed with narratives about what is happening in general. <br /> <br /> Man remains one of the greatest predators, but there is no doubt that foxes are able to live, not just survive beyond the efforts of the human.
