Basically, it's a little silly little thriller pretending to be a vintage drama / biopic. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason I wanted to see him in the first place was because I was curious to know how great Henry Fonda was at its peak. I was not disappointed - it produced a truly warm and charismatic performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, I can honestly say that I never got bored at any point of the movie, so it's a *** strong 1/2 on *****
