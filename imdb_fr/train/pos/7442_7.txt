I rented the movie (I do not think he had a theatrical release here), but I was expecting the worst. The previews made the film awful. I was actually very surprised, it was worth watching; he was vaguely scripted, almost like an entire movie piece. It had some very entertaining moments and, although defective, is an effective satire for the series and the people of the series without being too scathing. It is flawed, mainly because of the appalling soundtrack of the comedic "comedy" effects, but overall, it seems honest and generally true to the form of the show, in the manner of an artist or Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> At the moment when it's fashionable to criticize Jerry Springer, he's also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it would be proclaimed "the worst film ever made". I recommend this film to anyone interested in the show. An imperfect film but innovative and interesting.
