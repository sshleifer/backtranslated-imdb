I guess at least a few people watched it on September 2nd on TCM. If you knew that Hedy had to change her name to not be associated with this movie when she came to the United States. It was a huge scandal and I suppose the original release in the United States was so interrupted by censorship that it was virtually unintelligible. . I watched because I had just seen a documentary about the "bad women", actresses of the American council of censorship before the film created in the early thirties. It seemed to me that they were doing far more than Hedy's "most sensational" plans in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedy looked totally innocent in this respect, by today's standards, and it was nice to see her beauty preserved at first. It was a beautiful lyrical movie to relax. I liked it for what it was: a simple romance. I watched it after prerecording it at the beginning of an hour without sleep. I would like to see the first version published in the United States for comparison purposes.
