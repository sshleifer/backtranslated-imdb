"Ah Ritchie did another gangster movie with Statham," thought the average fan, expecting another Snatch / Lock stock; maybe wait a few time changes, but nothing too difficult for "me and the guys" to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Oh, be careful, you have to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no extra dietary coca at the counter, no "keep it up" screams while you squeak the fridge - watch the movie! No laughing other than the ones you can do you with considerable violence (and if it floats your boat, so be it) but solid leadership, excellent dialogue and excellent performance. <br /> <br /> My favorite - The Sopranos Big Pussy, always a reliable hood.
