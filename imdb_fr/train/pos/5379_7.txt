There is a lot going on in The College Girl Murders. A mad scientist creates a toxic gas that is almost undetectable. Before he can reap the fruits of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded monk and a whip-fitter. Scotland Yard is called to investigate after the murder of a co-ed in a church by natural gas, but the murder continues. Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases, at the entrance and exit of the college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - The killer. Why not love a killer who sneaks in a bright red outfit looking for KKK, with red gloves. The white whip he wears and uses is very distinct from the bright red dress. Although the idea of ​​a killer in a red outfit sneaking around a girls' school is quite common, this is one of the most sinister costumes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60 The music. I would really like to find the musical title of The College Girl Murders. I have a jazzy, hip and trendy 60s vibe that I loved. <br /> <br /> - Bizarre Touches. Beyond the killer's red dress and hood, the film features a sliding fireplace, an alligator pit with a cage, a poison bible, a strategically placed manikin, mini-skirts, Go-Go boots and hair from a height of one kilometer. I would describe it as a cross between the Batman TV show of the '60s and an Italian giallo. College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eyes. <br /> <br /> - The end. Let's just say there are more detours than a mountain road. Just when you think the killer was discovered, here is a twist ?? .. and another ??. And another ?? and another. <br /> <br /> What's not working: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy was supposed to be comical, but his buffoon character has too much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> - Why have alligators? Previously, I mentioned alligators in the pit. And although they are pleasant to the touch, they are useless. Why cross all the problems and not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some of the College Girl murders have no rhythm or rhythm. There are far too many moments in the film where things stop inexplicably. A better pace would have made this movie much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many of these German krimis, but some of the ones I saw (Soho Ghost, Blackmoor Castle Strangler, Dead Eyes of London) this can be my favorite. This one has a real funky meaning to what I'm really going into. If the plot had worked a little better, I could easily have awarded a 7/10 to The College Girl Murders.
