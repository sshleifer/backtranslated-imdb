This film was almost a great imaginative film. A mix of Shakespeare, pop, jazz and faerie tales. This film was an imaginary twist on the theme of Cinderella. Featuring a strong cast, directed by Kathleen Turner to perfect cast, this movie had it all. Everything except production values. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an exceptional production like this one, it came out with the same suspicious quality as all the other movies of TV movies. Besides a better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
