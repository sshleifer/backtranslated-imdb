No, I'm not kidding. If ever, NEVER, have the chance to see this movie see it. If you need to cut your arm to see it, see it. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives The Bus is unlike any movie you've ever seen. It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art. Although it contains mediocre shots, idiotic characters, mediocre dialogue, a strange actor's play and a publicly accessible cinematography in Iowa, the film actually succeeds. He strives to be the most stupid, strangest, and silly movie you've ever seen. And will the boy ever succeed? <br /> <br /> I'll introduce the plot to those who are worried about this kind of thing (the filmmakers obviously did not do it), but you really do not need to pay too much attention , The entire plot of the film is presented in a very long text played before the opening credits. In any case, FDTB (as its fans call it) is the story of a bus tour to Chicago, led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in town, and all the bus passengers are supposed to die, and all their souls would have gone to hell, except with Jesus in town, a lackey in hell puts an end to work and that makes Satan angry. well, he does not like to look like a fool in front of the guy, so he decides to put people on the bus so they directly sign their soul, but it's a heck he So you need to disguise himself, if not, who makes a tour with him on the right, then he disguises himself as Roger and he gets on the bus, where the driver is never named by name, but he is rather fat, so I suppose he's fatty. The bus (and the runners) are on a collision course with the wacky! <br /> <br /> Examples of madness: The title is repeated on the screen 3 times. I do not know why. A character appears in the bus in the middle of his journey without explanation or introduction and sometimes sits next to others. They look at her as if she did not belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange nostalgic looks, which are really the same shots repeated over and over again. I do not know why. After Satan gives a one-minute soliloquy on the transformation into a human form, a title card flashes: "Satan will transform himself." I do not know why. One of the characters is a woman who is very obviously a man in a train, and other characters call her "the glamorous Bridget". I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If my internship at Troma last summer had a positive effect, it was to get my copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
