It is a classic British thriller that I have always wanted to discover, but no opportunity has arisen so far. It is based on a popular play that had already been filmed several times before (notably in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version does not seem to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake being reviewed, the plot has been updated to reflect the current state of the war. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I mostly knew the first British comedians through the movies of Will Hay: a similar plot of legendary hauntings, smuggling and enemy agents, fits all in done in this vein (the script was written by the usual writing team of Hay Edman, Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); the passenger element in distress was therefore an equally tested formula. The star this time is Arthur Askey (assisted by Richard Murdoch) - I had never watched movies before - who is a hero as unlikely as Hay himself and whose personality is just as potentially irritating. .. but we're warming up soon Askey is definitely offering a number of witty replicas and amusing acts to justify the fact that the main character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split in two here, with Murdoch playing the role of the right partner of the star. <br /> <br /> The unique remote setting (movie events take place mainly during a stormy night) creates a wonderful atmosphere; the last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and possibly the arrival of the titular vehicle - is particularly striking and well managed. In the list of remaining actors, it is also worth mentioning Kathleen Harrison, who is the scared old girl stereotyped, accompanied by a parrot and always driven by the enthusiasm to take her first drink.
