"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with one touch" As soon as I heard that for the first time, my attention remained focused on the trailer, and after the first episode, I found myself in love of this series. A fairy tale of modern times that raises my spirits and holds my attention throughout the show. I think the acting and casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that adds to its perfection. Even the bad guys' past is overflowing with one way, from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens, they never seem to let me down. And the dead who would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up becoming purely comical (like an explosive Scratch & Sniff book) <br /> <br /> Even with the large number of crime shows we have now, daisies are one of the few that truly stands out, not only a mystery, but also a love story, comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama , put together in a wonderful pie ..... err show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was that it was on ABC. For years, I have never had any reason to turn to ABC. But that brought me back every week with a smile. It was as if Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to me for life. But just like that, after two seasons, a few rewards, a large fan base and positive feedback from critics, the show was dropped. Looks like Ned touched ABC again and killed him forever. However, I'll still be a fan of this show. And I recommend it to all those who love to talk a lot and love the shows they watch.
