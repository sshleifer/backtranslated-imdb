I loved Long Way Round and I was not even aware of Race to Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a little "hmm, it will be as good", I decided that was the case. Charlie Boorman was great, as were the other crew members. Nice to see him again with Ewan. There was a lot of cursing but it did not bother me. Regarding their no mention on the packaging. It's more related to the stupid classification exemption certificate that the BBFC has. They should have given him a 15 just for the language. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended series, I want more !!
