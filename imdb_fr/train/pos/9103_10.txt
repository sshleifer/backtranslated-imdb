In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as career, family, friendship and love. In this way, we will find a space between them to insert smaller stones, our small necessities. If you do the opposite, you will not have enough room for larger stones. The five protagonists of this film are women who could not organize the big "stones" of their lives. Ramon Salazar, Spanish director of cinematographic films, thus defines his first feature film, Stones. The film tells the parallel and conflictual trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) and Maricarmen (Vicky Pena, 1954 -). All strive to remove the stones that appear insistently on their way or, worse, that are in their place. They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) who also plays in "20 centimeters", "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto", "Between Vivir y Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia".
