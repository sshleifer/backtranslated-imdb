A community pool in Connecticut serves as a setting for this film "under the radar" that is charming, entertaining, entertaining and engaging. Although he has won awards in major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" has not been distributed to hordes of theaters across America, but has been distributed as a DVD and selectively broadcast in the movie theaters. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that "The Big Bad Swim" has never had the hype of a Hollywood release, given the number of shots Hollywood has released this year, such as "I know who killed me. " "The Big Bad Swim", a true independent film, had to swim alone upstream. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, in "The Big Bad Swim", the actress Paget Brewster is endearing and credible like Amy, the maths teacher plugged into her breaking point that is not only dumped by her husband, but who is about to lose his job, ends up risking a new life. Jeff Branson, TV soap opera star - who's HOT - plays Noah, the serious and vulnerable swimming teacher who goes deeper into the pool to help his students overcome their fears and discovers he can learn from his students. The pretty and sexy Jess Weixler (I just saw her in a bank advertisement?) Skillfully plays Jordan, the future swimmer who holds two jobs, one as a pole dancer, the other as a blackjack dealer . Her character is the catalyst for change within the set, but is the least understandable of the characters, due to the lack of a "back story" or motivation that drives her to do what she does . Jordan is young enough to live at home again with an ubiquitous younger brother who uses a video camera and spies on him. However, there is no evidence that his parents are involved in his life, which seems odd. There is no drunk mother or violent father here who explains why a normal, seductive girl from a suburban Connecticut would choose to be a dancer from the self-healing pole who is breaking down for bachelor parties. <br /> <br /> In spite of this argument, "The Big Cursed Bath" succeeds, in large part, because it is a happy and enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, learning to swim is the metaphor of life. In the end, it is better to jump with both feet and swim rather than sit on the deck, because life happens to you anyway. <br /> <br /> The Big Bad Swim is an excellent date film, a good dorm movie, an excellent movie "What I have not seen", and men like it so much than women.
