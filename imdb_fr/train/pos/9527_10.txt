It's the best crowd movie ever made. He deserved more than he had at the Oscars. Nominated for things like his score, his artistic direction, his supporting role (Newman), this film could easily have been nominated for the best film, the director (Mendes), the actor (Hanks), the actor in a supporting role (Newman and Law) and won !! Hanks gives one of his best performances, and the kid who played Michel Jr. was so good that I'm surprised not to see him in more movies today. The critics themselves have not given enough credit to this movie. But in addition to the incredible performances, another real star of this movie is the incredible music. It was by far the best score of the year. He was named but did not win. This is a great movie that should be seen by everyone. My grade A +
