Rohinton Mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is filled with passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is a little slow but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience. The film perfectly captures a given time and place with extreme precision. All the actors are Indian - they are little known to the "Western" public - but they are a pleasure to see, especially the little girl who acts in a very convincing way. Do not be put off by the title and summary of the plot - it's a movie to see on the big screen. We have a lot to learn from that.
