What happens to faded rock'n'roll stars in the late 1990s? They launch a return tour / meeting. At least, that's what the members of Strange Fruit, a 70's stadium rock band, do. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has the concession on condom distributors when he meets the son of the promoter. of a famous music festival. It was at this festival in the 70's that Strange Fruit broke out. The 70s are "retro" and the weather is conducive to this wide wave. He goes in search of the other members of the group. <br /> <br /> Part of the breakup of the group was the death and replacement of Keith, the brilliant singer and songwriter. The group was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all part of the working class from which they come. Beano, the drummer, played by Timothy Spall (brilliant in Secrets and Lies) is a layman, the bassist is a roofer and their main singer is still a rocker. While he owned a huge mansion, he was forced to sell it because his fortune did not last. Brian, the lead guitarist, is dead, so a young guitarist is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> The group reluctantly agrees to try the reunion. Abandoning their daily tasks, they begin to repeat and their manager approaches their label to ask them to republish their albums. But he wants them to start shooting again. And so they hit the club circuit around Europe. The club scene is not kind to those old, overweight and old-fashioned rockers. <br /> <br /> It's on tour that the film really begins to develop. All the old conflicts are refreshed, with the numbers of Keith and Brian hovering in all directions. They are all united because they are all looking for a second chance for the greatness they had missed earlier. And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made the game together so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy begins under the name of Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a film more focused on the dramas, according to the relations of the members of the group. Even though the film is still very funny, it's the evolving characters, struggling to cope with the deaths of Brian and Keith and their own personal demons, that make the movie work.
