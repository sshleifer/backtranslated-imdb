Please, future writers, producers, directors, learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I had never seen a story so audacious and original created for the big screen. Audacious, because the script was constantly taking a step forward so many fantastic movies were being avoided - a step forward towards something new, creative and daring. By the time you think "oh, I've seen it already" or "I'm sure it's going to happen now," StarDust would bring an unexpected change and get you more involved in the story. <br /> <br /> the actors are brilliant - even the smallest part is performed with such talent that I am impressed by the creators of this film. Robert De Niro is beautiful and plays with such energy that he steals the show in every scene where he is. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch and Claire Danes is an excellent choice for the innocent and loving "star", Yvaine. Other big names play exceptional roles. I had the fill that everyone is trying to give their best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he's "invented" for this universe - just exceptional. <br /> <br /> I watched this film in preview today, one day before the official release. and hope it will be a huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments and beautiful tender scenes. The look in Yvaine's eyes, the "frivolities" of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable <br /> <br /> For me, it's the most entertaining film of 2007, look and enjoy it <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Exceptional <br /> <br /> peace and love
