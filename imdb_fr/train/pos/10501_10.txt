Super Mario 64 is without a doubt the biggest game ever created. It is so addictive that you can play for hours and hours without stopping. I have already beaten the game 4 times, but I have never had 120 stars ... (I have 111) ... but I hope to reach them one day. Although I had only officially played this game at the age of seven, I loved watching my sisters play it. Now, I'm 13 years old and I always play that, erasing the games and starting again. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredible for a start of the game in N64. The gameplay is addictive. The controls are great. The levels are difficult, but not impossible. Battles against Bowser are difficult. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why not get it for yourself? Stow the X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii and go find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing and wonderful game.
