I just watched this on Turner Classic Movies Last night, for the first time, I saw it and loved it. I like a lot of older films, especially because of the absence of any foul language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's movies. I also think that they have been made much better in many cases (but not all). Jimmy Stewart is one of my favorites. I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch and I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you think the same thing about older movies, I do not think you can go wrong with this one. I believe that "You've Got Mail" is a remake (although it is slightly different and also a very nice movie.) From this movie. For a relaxing evening with a movie, you do not have to be ashamed of your kids or anyone else who looks at you, get it or listen to it on one of the classic movie channels.
