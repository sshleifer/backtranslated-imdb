OK Rain's 1927 film, Rain from Rain, where he plays the half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the well-kept English engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for her attentions, but the two women have a big surprise when his wife introduces herself (Patricia Dupont). The predatory woman is ready to divorce until she discovers that he may be on the brink of making a fortune. Bow adjusts his hash quickly. <br /> <br /> Bow has the character to spare and some great scenes: his opening nude bath, his hula in grass skirt and the dog rescue scene with Bow and Brook doing their own stunts. <br /> <br /> Note: the IMDb credit list is wrong. The credits from the film (from the DVD I have) indicate that Patricia Dupont plays the role of Ms. Haldane - not Margaret Truax, as shown on IMDb.
