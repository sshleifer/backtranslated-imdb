A Chinese scholar who severely criticizes the arrogant and hawkish nationalist policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in prewar Japan is accused of being a "communist" and imprisoned for life. His loving wife, who totally supports her husband and her ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This film is an enormous statue erected to the glory of the role of the mother in the history of humanity. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less than sublime in the main role and it is a monumental scandal that she did not get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. She was awarded to a girl with very limited potential . <br /> <br /> This deeply moving and "human" feature is a must for all "real kids" on the planet.
