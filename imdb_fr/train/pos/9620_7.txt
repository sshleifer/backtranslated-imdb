There are so many "Hollywood" movies that are not just a torture to watch, but have no impact on anyone's life. While movies do not always have to have a deep meaning, it's good to know that there are still filmmakers who care about telling "human" stories. I will not reveal the premises of this brilliant film. However, the screenplay is certainly one of the most complex and memorable I have ever seen in my life, and I am also a 32 year old film buff! Bug is one of the top ten on my list of favorites, including: On the waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, just to name a few. This "moving" film should become one of your favorites too, that is, if you have a heart!
