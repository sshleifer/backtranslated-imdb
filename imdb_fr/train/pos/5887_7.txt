So, Mary and Rhoda have grown old - who does not? I was a teenager when Mary created the first and a "young adult" when she left the airwaves. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, the film may not have fed the comedy of the original series, but enough moments reminded her of the spirit of the series to make it appropriate tribute. Example: the producer who engages Mary and then dictates the idea of ​​a new series on "the elderly". Is not this typical of the mentality of Hollywood's current television and movie "bean counters?" It may not be Mary TYLER MOORE's best show, but it's a welcome return on one of the best shows we grew up with in the '70s.
