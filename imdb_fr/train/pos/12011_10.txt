I am stunned by the negative comments I have read and can only assume that the people who made such comments were less than honest.

If anyone of any Christian religion can watch this film without being touched in a positive way - I must say that it is a reflection of the individual and NOT of the film. I give the movie a "10" and encourage honest souls to see it. At the very least, it is an extremely sincere portrait of the man who gave all he had for what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a a permanent reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be from regardless of our religious beliefs- Ann Pruitt-
