The perfect murder does not exist. Lieutenant Columbo knows it. Ken Franklin, the other half of the crime writing team, does not know it. He kills his partner, Jim Ferris, who was considering becoming a soloist. Now Columbo enters the picture and asks all sorts of questions to Mr. Franklin.And for another question.Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by the young Steven Spielberg before his fame. Steven Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with a shabby look. It is hard to believe that this man could solve any crime.But he could do it.Everyone and every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who can represent this character. Do not make any remakes, please. This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer and Martin Milner plays the victim.Rosemary Forsyth plays Joanna Ferris, the wife of the victim.There is something endearing in the scenes between Columbo and her.How he makes the omelette and everything .Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. I have been a fan of Columbo since childhood and I always like to watch them. For many years, they did not tell stories about Columbo, but he's back.Back for one last question.
