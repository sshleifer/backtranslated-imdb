This movie is for Halloween what "Christmas Story" is hilarious for Christmas: both are inexpensive and low-budget star-type movies ... and are two of the funniest and funniest movies available, both seasonal CLASSICS !!! "Spaced Invaders" comes at a gallop from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters ... the five zany martians, Klembecker the broker, Russell the deputy, Vern at the "fuel depot" and many more! Just watch this movie to believe it and, like "Christmas Story", it keeps getting better every time you watch, and you get fun little things every time !! THE MOST DEFINITIVE TEN!
