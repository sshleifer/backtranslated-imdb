"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it's very entertaining and accessible to many audiences. The original movie could have been wonderful, with Dick Van Dyke taking over his Broadway role, but they tinkered with the plot, so the movie is very unsatisfactory. This remake, broadcast on ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script and also includes original songs that were used in a national tour that this film took off, from which Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (a choreographed this film.) <br /> <br /> Jason Alexander is a very different type of Dick Van Dyke, but he is a good choice in the role of Albert (before starting the movie "Seinfeld", he started in musical theater). Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. Tyne Daly (Mae) and Mark Kudisch (Conrad Birdie) (his role in the national tour) are also a great job. <br /> <br /> This film is not without problems. A major responsibility is Chynna Phillips, who, attractive as she is, simply looks and seems too old to be a Kim teenager. And George Wendt is a little bland like his father, throwing a few "kids" (a member of the original cast, Paul Lynde, stole the show with.) <br /> <br /> But in the together, it's an enchantment, a well-made film that the material deserved.
