This film has no history. It's just a bunch of guys torturing an innocent girl to death. <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> That's what they do: they beat her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like a bird's food, turn her on a chair until she that she vomit, expose her to the loud noise, pour boiling oil on her, put worms in her wounds, crush her hand with a hammer and finally passes a needle in her eye. <br /> <br /> This film was so realistic that if I did not know it, it would have had to be a fake. Although disgusted by this movie, I really liked it. It scared me. I guess it's useful for something. I give him a 10/10.
