Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV series I have ever watched! Some of the greatest rock n 'roll songs ever written have been performed by 15 very talented singers / performers. He also (in my opinion) had the most touching, comforting and surprising end of all reality TV. This made me shed tears of happiness for the winner !!! During the 13 weeks of this televised competition, viewers were able to familiarize themselves and become familiar with all the candidates. After about 30 episodes, the remaining candidates seemed to be more friends than mere strangers fighting for a reality show. And the fact that INXS was and remains one of the biggest rock'n'roll bands ever added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality TV series. If you have not recorded the series, ROCK STAR: INXS the DVD is a great alternative.
