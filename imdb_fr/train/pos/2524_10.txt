I did not expect Gackt's and Hyde's performances to be as well done, nor to such an elaborate and artistic film, with enough intrigue to keep your interest and enough diversity to make it original. This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I will be on the lookout for the next film. I particularly like the fact that it's a vampire movie, but it was not a cheesy vampire movie, or a detail that embellished that fact. The characters all had human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasty, and it makes them really sorry throughout their lives. I give this movie two inches so far. Certainly the best movie I've seen in the last five years.
