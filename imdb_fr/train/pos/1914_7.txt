Eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character, Paul Hennessey, and the relationship he had with his kids was the best part of the series. <br /> <br /> I always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget was already created before, Kerry is rather unique and I can understand her in many ways, even if I'm not sure I like the direction that his character gave to later series. <br /> <br /> The first episodes were fun, good simple plots about the discipline at Paul and Cate the kids, however I think the show lost its luster when John Ritter died. I admired the actors and the technical team for wanting to continue the series, but when he passed away, I felt that the program was doing it. For me, the goal of the show was based on the guide "8 simple rules to go out with my teenage daughter". It had been written by a real man with teenage girls. The relevance and the angle of the show had changed without Hennessey's father. . <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed to be more and more boring, Rory stayed the same and Cate still gave her life lessons that seemed previously more fun when everything was left to Paul. I think the grandfather is funny (especially when he looks at Great Escape) but I think C.J is not necessary for the show. He is funny in places, but I felt that the scenarios on his arrival were very similar to the other American series. Especially the newer do not lack excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that Cate is working at school and that C.J and Granddad are still there too? I would always recommend this show to friends because she was very strong at first and was well worth watching by Paul and Kerry, but the following were at best average.
