I listened to it by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted. I am a professional actor and the performances have amazed me. They felt totally improvised, absolutely unassigned. I did not know if it was written in a script, or how it was shot and waited until the end to see the credits, then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the screenwriter-director has also made a very good film called Everyday People, which I really liked. The shame of the film industry is that such excellent projects do not have the distribution and advertising they deserve and do not live under the radar. This film deserves to be stolen high and proudly. I urge people to watch and watch.
