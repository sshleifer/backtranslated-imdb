It was the first PPV in a new era for WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel were all gone. It was necessary to push a new generation of talents. And it all started with Lex Luger, a former NWA heavyweight world champion, who was playing the title against Yokozuna. Lex traveled all over the United States on a bus called the Lex Express to urge the Americans to rally behind him in an attempt to defeat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and put the WWE champion title back the hands of the Americans. As such, there was a lot of anticipation for this game. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV requires an underlying card, which gives some good things. <br /> <br /> The night began with Razor Ramon's victory over Ted DiBiase in a good match. The story that unfolded at the time was that DiBiase had chosen Ramon and even offered him slave work after his shock at the 1-2-3 Kid on RAW in July. Ramon, angry, had teamed up with the 1-2-3 Kid team against the Money Inc. team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To resolve their differences, they both had face-to-face matches against DiBiase against Ramon and Shyster against The Kid. Razor was able to fix his problem after drilling a razor. <br /> <br /> Next come the Steiner Brothers, opposing the WWE Tag Team titles to the Heavenly Bodies. After the intervention of the director of "The Bodies", Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner with a tennis racket, he was able to win the victory in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect had been arguing since Wrestlemania IX, when Shawn Michaels faced Perfect after his loss to Lex Luger. Perfect then cost Michaels the title of intercontinental champion when he distracted her in a title game against Marty Janetty. Michaels had won the title back and put it on the line against Mr. Perfect, but Michaels now had a strong ally in his corner with his 7-foot Diesel bodyguard. Micheals and Perfect did a great game here, but it was Diesel that made the difference, shooting Perfect from the ring and throwing him into the steel steps to allow Shawn to win the count. <br /> Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his teammate earlier in the night, easily taking into account the 1-2-3 Kid. <br /> <br /> Then came one of the biggest games of the night as Bret Hart prepared to fight Jerry Lawler for the undisputed title of WWE king. But Lawler came out on crutches, saying he had been injured in a car accident earlier in the day and had arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a passable match that Hart won with a sniper. He was then jumped from behind by Lawler. This brought WWE President Jack Tunney to the ring, who told Lawler that he would be banned for life if he did not fight Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the sniper, but Hart refused to let go and the referee overruled. So, after all, Lawler was named undisputed king of the WWE. This match was followed by Ludvig Borda who destroyed Marty Janetty in a short match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker completed his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, who began in 1992 when the Undertaker defeated Wippleman's client, Kamala, in Summerslam. when the last monster of Wippleman, the giant Gonzales, had destroyed Taker at Rumble then at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzales then turned to Wippleman, choking him after a bad match. <br /> <br /> Then it was time to act for six different players. The Smoking Gunns (Bart and Bllly) and Tatanka beat the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka pinning Samu. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, accompanied by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, featuring the WWE title against Lex Luger. the Lex Express. Lex came out to attack, but Yokozuna took control. Lex returned, however, as he managed to avoid a banzai fall and then knocked Yokozuna out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji while Yokozuna was counted. Luger had won a good match !!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. The heroes have all come to congratulate him on his victory. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger proved he could be beaten. The only question was who could beat him in the ring and get that title.
