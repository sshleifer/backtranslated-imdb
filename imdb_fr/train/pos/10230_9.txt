People forget that there were several scams from King Kong - Congo, King Kong vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all stole, but YETI is autonomous. It borrows only one element from King Kong and is the attraction of the animal with a single female. <br /> <br /> The myth of YETI is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists have fascinated him. existed, but there is no scientific data to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it is worth watching. The first time I looked at it was in the early '80s in "The Dark Mistress of Elvira". When I was a kid, it made me shudder, especially when the YETI got angry. I saw him around 1:00 am on ABC about 2 to 3 years ago. The review has made me appreciate it more, it has some overall good effects (for its time) and the story features a dumb boy and his dog, as well as a demonic businessman who wants to kill the YETI for his own purposes. Plus, the music is pretty cool, it looks a lot like YETI. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians create a super monster atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and half of the 10.
