I saw this film for the first time almost 21 years ago, when it was a morning ITV (before the era of cable and satellite). I was out of school with mumps and I was totally wrapped up in the movie. I have it on video purchased for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy. David Niven is my favorite actor of all time and I think it's a parody that he was watched many times when the Oscars arrived. I also think that the queen should have made him a knight as he did easily for the film industry, if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the film turns from black and white to color and vice versa is well done and the film has actors as remarkable as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and an early appearance of Richard Attenborough.
