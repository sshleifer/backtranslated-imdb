An exaggerated melodrama typical of its period (mid-1950s) and appropriate food in the morning. Rock Hudson, the hulk that everyone falls in love with, plays its role as the usual stereotype, but while in Giant, realized the same year, when his equipment and his co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average in this film, he is right. not good enough to raise the caliber beyond a sharp history of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack sinking into the drunken stupor of the movie) and Dorothy Malone, playing the role of a poor, rich and poor girl totally defeated, eventually lose the others and Hudson gets Bacall - which is rather wood in this part that does not have enough character or spirit to make it go away. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the good ends happily and unfortunately unfortunately, that is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested to read that the film is based on a true story that justified the plot. Like other films from this period, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Maybe the movie could be redone: Stack's character would make more sense if he hid Mitch's homosexual feelings by getting married. Far From Heaven, by Todd Haynes, has greatly improved All that the sky allows, also realized by Sirk. Haynes could perhaps redo Written on the Wind and give us a truly memorable movie.
