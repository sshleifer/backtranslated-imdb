My brother has brought this movie from the rental store back home and I remember waiting for it to be so boring. I think the title particularly scared me. I never remember having started a movie with such low expectations and being completely conquered. I watched the movie twice before letting my brother take him back to the store. It is very rare that a film speaks to me like this one. Ruby's situation prevented me completely as she tried to find a place in her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I could have watched for hours. Another disadvantage is that I am dissatisfied with all that Ashley Judd has done since. She is so perfect in this movie. This film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time.
