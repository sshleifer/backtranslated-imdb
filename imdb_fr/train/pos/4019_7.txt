Since I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, it made me even more impatient to watch this movie. I remember that he had been interviewed by "Jay Leno" and said he had turned down a role in Adam Sandler's huge budget comedy, "The Longest Yard," in the film. So, obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has actor chops. I'm not going to abuse Snoop too much for his performance in "The Tenants". There are certainly better rappers / actors, like Mos Def, who could have done more with his role. But the fact is that Snoop did a "good" job. He seems unable to get rid of some of his well-known body movements and vocal inflections, but it's something even Jack Nicholson has trouble doing. The fact is that I found him convincing in the role and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character was captivating. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance of the film, although his subtle game is probably overshadowed by Snoop's not-so-subtle game. Being a great reader and aspiring writer myself, I could not help but find the characters and intrigue something fascinating. It aggravated me to see that Snoop's character constantly asked McDermott to read his work, and reprimanded him for criticizing him. But what do you know? I'm sure many writers are like that. His character was supposed to be defective, just like McDermott's, in his own way. My only moderate criticism of the film would be its end. For some reason, it seemed too hurried, although the resolution certainly has a meaning and is motivated by the characters rather than the plot.
