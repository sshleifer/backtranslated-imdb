I watched this film so many times through my childhood that even today, I can pretty much see all the dialogues. And when I look at it now, it makes me happy and, surprisingly, I still laugh. I think it's amazing to see how they managed to train animals, especially the cat, to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. However, looking at it now, I can unfortunately also notice that it is not the masterpiece that I once thought. But I prefer to remember how I felt when I was younger watching it in VHS on my first TV, which would qualify the image in yellow. And since this is a children's movie, that's why I would give it 10/10 anyway.
