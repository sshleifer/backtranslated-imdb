French production in which major directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films reflecting their reflections on the events of September 11th. <br /> <br /> The film segments vary considerably in content and quality. Two allusions to the American complicity in terrorist acts (in Chile against Allende, deceased on September 11, 1973, described in the segment by the British director Ken Loach) and in Palestine by Israelis supported by the United States, presented in the segment Egyptian director Youssef Chahine). Two others point to other acts of destruction (a Palestinian suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, shot by Israeli director Amos Gitan, the Japanese "holy war" against the West during the Second World War, by Shohei Imamura). <br /> <br /> Ironies abound in many stories. The shadows that darken the apartment of a distressed old man in New York suddenly disappear when the World Trade tower telescopes on the ground in the work of Sean Penn, giving the man a momentary joy. But under this bright light, he can finally see that his wife is really gone. In Mira Nair's film, based on a real incident, a missing young man, also in New York, son of a Pakistani family, is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist, but he later turns out to be hero who sacrificed himself by trying to save other people in the towers. <br /> <br /> Poignant moments await you. Loach asks his Chilean exile to quote St. Augustine, saying that hope is built of anger and courage: anger at the current situation, courage to change them. Imamura tells us that there is no holy war. Samira Makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young Afghan schoolchildren, exiled to Iran, telling them about the events that have just taken place in New York. But they are naturally more impressed by a major event in their refugee camp, where two men fell into a deep well, one killed, the other suffering from a broken leg. This is a comprehensible tragedy on a large scale for 6 years old. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Ouedraogo, from Burkina Faso, creates a drama in which the son of a sick woman spots Osama bin Laden in their village and gathers his friends to help capture the fugitive terrorist, in order to obtain $ 25 million US reward. He told his friends not to let any of their adults talk about their plans, because the older ones would simply be wasting money on cars and cigarettes while he was planning to help his mother and the other sick and needy. <br /> <br /> It's the Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (maker of "Amores Perros") who provides by far the most powerful and scary segment, which shows for the most part only a black screen with soundtrack loops composed of singing and occasional voices and background noises. Brief visual flashes gradually allow us to see bodies falling from the upper floors of the towers, and we realize that the thud is that these bodies are hitting the ground. The sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a fixed shot with a sentence that appears in Arabic only, followed by a translation: "Does the light of God guide us or blind us?"
