We talked a lot about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first real movie "Miike" and I thought that kind of description could have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All Miike brands are there, violence, dark humor, homosexuality, taboo tests and the central character hard to love. Shinjuku is, however, one of Miike's best-trained films. He said in an interview that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film has a really captivating energy and a raw edge that seems so fresh that even though he might be able to capture a more complex film visually or technically, he does could not reproduce or improve the purity of this film. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the violence is totally visceral, blood gushes and hard knocks are complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman is rubbing her face against a chair. (Only a Miike movie could get you out of it with a phrase like this.) The movie has a fantastic beat, unlike Dead or Alive which starts and ends strongly and dives in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar problems, Miike is clearly concerned about the post-war relationship between Japanese and Chinese, and this emotional subject is well treated here, as the central character comes to life as you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing the praises of Shinjuku enough. I do not want to give too much. It's Miike before he starts using CGI to animate his films and almost reminds of something like Sonatine from Kitano. The central characters are beautifully made and the final touch ensures that as soon as the film is finished, you will find it to solve the problem.
