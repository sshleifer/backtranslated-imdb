North Africa in the 1930s. In a small Arab city on the edge of the Sahara, a beautiful woman seeks meaning to her life and a beautiful Trappist monk fleeing her crisis of faith. They will meet and the passions will be moved, but even the Sand Diviner does not know if they will find happiness or sorrow here in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is a pure hokum, but the movie is still very entertaining and beautiful to watch. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer form a superb screen couple. It is, to put it simply, beautiful, and Boyer gives a performance more effective and more discreet, leaving his sensitive face play most often his role for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role of count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly and talkative guide (all the "Arabic" that he and the others speak in the movie is pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a sweet mother superior; Alan Marshal as a respectable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic book carrier; John Carradine as a mysterious divine of the sands; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. <br /> <br /> The legends of the film will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (glancing over the nun's shoulder) as girls from the convent; poor Nigel De Brulier as a reader of the monastery; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel employee, all uncredited. <br /> <br /> Color films from the 1930s are both rare and enjoyable to watch. This film is no exception. Cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to be shot on location. Yuma, Arizona, gave filmmakers all the sand dunes they could desire, but contaminated drinking water and 135-degree heat quickly spawned society's revolt. When daily dispatches showed that Boyer's face had burned like a bright red tomato, producer David O. Selznick finally gave way. The rest of the film was shot on a sound stage in Hollywood.
