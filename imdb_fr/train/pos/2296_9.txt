_The Actors_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of older actors whose career is slowly less active than before, but an amazing homage to French actors and their cinema. <br /> <br /> Backed by a solid reflection on the cinema and the game (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which the famous actors play their own role (not to be confused with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur) is rather vague and follows the actors in a series of episodes that make the film quite amusing. As Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play her role (great actress, she is extremely serious especially when, in the role of Dussolier, she gets bored), while actors are running in the street, asking for autographs, fights and gossip happen, we recognize the pastiche of other scenes in which everyone (or others) played. <br /> <br /> In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most of them having at least fifty) or I do not know French cinema, this film is less interesting because most references will be missed, but it will still offer a good reflection on aging, acting, public life ...
