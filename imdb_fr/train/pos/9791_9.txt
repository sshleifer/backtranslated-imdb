I will give nothing by describing the plot of this film other than saying that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose friend and the closest companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a crime novel while the blind woman tries to understand why her friend has ended her life. As she continues her investigation and the information accumulates, it inevitably leads to a devastating conclusion. The film is expertly punctuated and the acting, especially of Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film has definitely reached maturity and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the United States.
