It was probably one of the best-made movies of the 1940s - Warner Bros. at the peak of his style. The photograph of Sol Polito is undoubtedly his finest achievement: magnificent compositions and lighting with delicate shadows. Max Steiner contributes to one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the embodiment of his classic method of leit pattern. The music adds a great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It's interesting to note that the same production crew that made this film immediately directed "Now, Voyager" later that year - a good movie that won honors and awards and became a favorite historic, ciefly because he played with Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better movie - better done in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A very unusual movie that entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than projecting their own modern creative sensibility or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing must be judged in its own time reference and for what it tries to achieve in its own way. Most of the complaints I read in these magazines are so childish and miss the point. If you want a perfect filet mignon, do not go to the bakery counter and start complaining and complaining about the dough. The art of film criticism is truly lost for a large part of the population. Sorry, maybe if this movie had had a Rolling Stones score and a hundred intricate and intricate sub-intrigues, you'd all be happily happy. I'm going to take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions any day of the week!
