The last season of Roseanne was a crazy roller coaster ride. This last episode corresponds exactly to what a previous comment said, it tells us that even if we thought we knew the characters we did not know. Roseanne is getting closer to the first season and tells us that this show is her interpretation of her life. She says in this final episode that she has changed events and people as she sees fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married opposite women in real life, and Dan died when she made it live. Through the events of her life, she changed them in her writing. Do not we all want to be able to do that? Do not we all have a moment when we wish we could just use an eraser and change as we please? That's what she did with the whole episode. And to another comment, I would say that I do not feel wrong, the family was real in my mind, it simply changed the way events happened in their lives. An A + ending with a show A + !!!!
