Fire And Ice is an animated film taking place in a fantastic world. The film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier that houses the ice lord named Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn, who tries to avenge those who were killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn goes looking for him and also tries to kill and kill Nekron. Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He brought us animated masterpieces like the film version of Fritz The Cat and some of the movies he wrote himself, such as the big movie Heavy Traffic. I did not like Fire and Ice as much as Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I still found the film enjoyable. There were some very nice animations in some parts and the story was quite amusing. The only basic complaint I can make is that I would like the film to have more story, because the story it uses is very thin and there is not much to do. I also wish that the film is a little longer because it lasts less than 80 minutes. It's still an exciting adventure movie that, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, is suitable for ages 8 and up. I only wish there was a more elaborate story and it lasted a little longer.
