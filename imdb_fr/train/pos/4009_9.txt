Children, regardless of their age, do not want to know the sex life of their parents. And adult children are often seriously disconcerted and confounded by any evidence that aging parents have an active sex drive. Finally, many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a sullen and ill-fated widow who would go unnoticed almost everywhere to discover his painful abilities and his need for raw passion with a handsome man of half his age. <br /> "The mother" is a provocative look at a filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay at home, watches "TV" and vegetates after her husband for almost three decades, and a dominant dominant type who buries him with a huge heart attack. <br /> <br /> May (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in their own way. The male son lives with a beautiful wife who could lead him to the bankruptcy court with his extravagant business venture. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) is a teacher who aspires to succeed as a writer. She is attractive, not pretty, and she seems to have a close relationship with Mom - at first. <br /> <br /> Back home after burying her husband, May decides not to stay there. Rejecting the typical widowhood with her legacy of boring days and no adventure, she will stay with Paula who has a young son. Paula's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a strong and attractive entrepreneur who seems to take a long time to complete an addition to the house of May's son. May is pretty caught up with Darren who drinks hard and sniffs coke and whose treatment of Paula should have alerted May that he was, for sure, a member of the Royal Academy of Officers. <br /> The following is a torrid affair between Darren and the thirsty and now bubbling widow of life (dare I reborn?). The love scenes are graphic, but come in second place after the feather and feather sketches of the amateur artist who then play a role in the drama (or debacle, you choose). <br /> <br /> The theater in Manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon with over half of the audience in the May age group. That some have been shocked or disturbed to see her surrender with an erotic abandonment in the arms of a much younger man is a euphemism. <br /> <br /> This blindly honest look at the awakened passion of an elderly woman after decades of conscientious obedience to her husband's desire to stay at home and raise her children (she also mentions that he did not like to have any friends dude) is coming up with a number of problems. Although May's bent with Darren does not constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions, and problems, with a mother who is sleeping her daughter's lover. And Paula is not made of the most robust things to start with. The case, once divulged, helps dispel the mother-daughter relationship that, from Paula's point of view, left something to be desired. Ms. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a girl who wants her mother's support and love. Life did not give him a terrible hand, but it's not a bed of roses either. <br /> <br /> May is firmly committed to recognizing her sexuality and expecting and even demanding a happy future. But she is also inevitably vulnerable. She is fishing in unknown emotional waters. Who controls his relationship with Darren and why, for her, the questions are difficult to understand and even less to solve. In her sixties, she is still progressing. <br /> <br /> "Something must give" has recently presented a mature sexuality, but in a fun and antiseptic way, ensuring that no viewer would be disconcerted. After all, this is Jack Nicholson and the beautiful Diane Keaton who plays in the world of the rich. And to ensure that no serious psycho-social issues have been explored, Keaton's girlfriend, Amanda Peet, daughter of Keaton, not only blesses the match, but assures the public knows that she and her old love never turned to the bag. <br /> <br /> Not easy here. Anne Reid's inspired performances force the discomfort of some while inspiring respect for others. Her naked body is overflowing with sexuality for some and seems absurd as an object of physical attraction to others (the comments of the audience today reflecting all these points of view). <br /> <br /> Congratulations to director Roger Michell for addressing a fascinating question. story with verve and empathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
