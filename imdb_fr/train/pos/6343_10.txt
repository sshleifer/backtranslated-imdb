Let me stage. It's school holidays and there is absolutely nothing in the cinema. I am with my friend who decides what to see. We are looking for a movie that starts soon and "The Grinch" appears. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What we had is a roller coaster of pleasure. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (which I could add as the number one actor in the whole world) was absolutely gorgeous as Grinch in the best movie of this Ron Howard (next at Apollo 13). The way this film was shot, the landscapes, the actors, the props and the music were just incredible. It really gave life to this childhood movie. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the history of grinch. As we all know, Grinch is a horrible person who simply can not stand Christmas. He lives high above Whoville and has never mixed well with city dwellers. But a little girl will radically change Grinch's eyes on life and on others. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by the adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as she finds the kindly role of him right away. She tries to break the barrier and help the Grinch settle and mingle with the city's inhabitants. <br /> <br /> This film is a film of laughter for the whole family, children and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
