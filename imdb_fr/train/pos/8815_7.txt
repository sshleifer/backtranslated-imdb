This collection of eleven news in a film is a great idea and presents some interesting segments, but also disappointing surprises. On the basis of the tragic events of September 11, 2001 in the United States of America, eleven administrators were invited to give their point of view on the American tragedy. The result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy for the American people, but especially for intolerance in the world, with different cultures and peoples. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (United Kingdom) presents the best segment, namely September 11, 1973 in Chile, when dictator Augusto Pinochet, with the support of the United States, destroyed the democratic government of Salvador Alliende. <br /> <br /> The other excellent segments are Youssef Chahine (Egypt), show the intolerance in the world and the number of victims made by the governments of the United States in different countries of contemporary history; and that of Mira Nair (India), which tells a true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family, whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the United States, when he was really a hero. <br /> <br /> are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows innocent Afghan refugee children preparing a harmless bomb shelter, while their teacher tries to explain what happened to them other end of the world; the romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows the life of a New York couple close to the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the effects of his war in a small place and the solitary protest of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic and shows that life goes on. and the story of Shohei Imamura is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war but sadness and dishonor. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Quedraogo's segment (Birkina Faso) is very naive, but it describes the terrible harsh conditions in this part of Africa. <br /> <br /> The segment of Amos Gital (Israel) is very boring and manipulative, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, horrible, without any inspiration and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("September 11")
