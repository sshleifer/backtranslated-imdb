Does anyone know by any chance where this film was shot? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It seems to be England. However, Ivy's building certainly resembles the Brill building, with its fascinating elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl is considered to play "Sir Charles Gage". I may have blinked, but I have never seen it. Maybe he was the husband's lawyer, but, again, I do not remember that character, other than the fact that he made a phone call. Maybe he was in the air force? Or the stage of the ballroom? Has anyone seen him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 when he shot this movie.
