I was glad to see that she had black hair! I've been a fan for thirty years and I'm disgusted with the two previous attempts to film the stories. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted that the writers have updated the period to include a computer. t ruin it at all. In fact, I watched the movie twice a day, which is an irrefutable sign. That's what I do with books I love too. <br /> <br /> I thought that all the characters were well represented and that they represented very well the beginnings of Modesty Blaise, as evidenced by books and comic books. I should also disagree with a comment made by a previous reviewer about the bad guys being ugly. Did he actually read the books? <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good film and I can not wait to see the sequel with anticipation.
