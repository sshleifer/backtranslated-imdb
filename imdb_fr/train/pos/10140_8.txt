Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" will love this episode of MOH. Those who know the basic archetypal stories on which most classic comics are based will recognize themselves immediately. <br /> <br /> The underestimated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the scenarios for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES ELLE) is the kind of guy whose beauty all men can go in both ways. He could play a cool guy so misunderstood by the next guy, or he could play the same role with a scary nuance of corrosive melancholy. In the case of Right to Die, it adopts the last approach and it works without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who recently had an affair with his slutty receptionist (Robin Sydney), much dissatisfaction with his inconsolable and ruthless wife, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them are involved in a terrible car accident when they come back from an unsuccessful "catch-up" weekend and are terribly burned in a fire, they hesitate to remove it, not without an enthusiastic elbow on his part. Lawyer and best friend (Corbin Bernsen, looking for the worst nowadays.) <br /> <br /> But Abbey was never able to give up without a fight, and that's where the theme of the episode enters the scene. Cuckold husbands and wives have always been the favorite subject of the genre for some spooky supernatural schemes (and OOKY), and this affair is definitely no exception. In fact, the relationship between sex and coolness must remind Bill Gaines, somewhere, with joy, in his mausoleum. <br /> <br /> And that's not to say that John Esposito's original script gives only a slight twisting angle. You do not realize while you are watching that you only know half of the story, until the end ... (think of what's behind with more guts and gazongas, and you're there.) <br /> <br /> Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot either. At least Rob Schmidt displays touches of talent here and there with direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone photo messaging a truly horrible experience! As with most episodes of mental health, this one has a recurring theme this season of skinning and dismemberment, so lack of discretion is not necessary.
