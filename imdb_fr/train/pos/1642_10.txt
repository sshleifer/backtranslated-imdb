I have not seen the movie since it was first released, but it was memorable. The performances of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were superb, the photography excellent, a turbulent story and everything else was of the highest level. Still, it seems to have been pretty much forgotten <br /> <br /> Maybe because the UK is a strange market but I have not seen the movie on TV or video, which is sad. Has it been more successful in the United States, where it could rightly be considered a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> One should always count that 50% of a good movie is made of music and although I'm not sure, The title theme was a simple but touching clarinet solo of "What Friend Have us in Jesus ". The film then refuted that! Am I right or wrong?
