Fortunately, I recently saw this on a plane bound for Singapore (I thought I missed it at Cinemalaya Filmfest). Paris, I love you is a collection of 20 shorts (about 5 minutes each) of 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite segments is Alfonso Cuarn's "Parc Monceau" (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban), directed in a continuous shooting and starring Nick Nolte . <br /> <br /> The Tuileries of the Coen brothers with Steve Buscemi in the role of tourist in the Underground was hilarious! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe, Place des Victoires, were an obsession. <br /> <br /> Maggie Gyllenhaal, American actress and pharmacist of the "Red Children's District", portrayed anticipation and grief in such a short time The weather was great. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, a vampire victim in the Quartier de la Madeleine, was rather surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a nice couple in "Pre-Lachaise" Wes Craven. Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual as a girlfriend actress of a French boy visually impaired in the "Faubourg Saint-Denis". But despite the many representations of young love, a more mature performance of Gena Rowlands in 'Latin Quarter' has also been a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> This film is perfect for people with ADHD because each sequence is thorough and thorough. thought of. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotes. One of them, in particular, is that of an unfaithful husband who finally left his mistress to stay with his dying wife in his last days: "By posing as a man in love, he became a man in love . "
