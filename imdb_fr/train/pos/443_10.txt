I saw this movie for the first time in the early 90's, when it was released. The room with a view was also recently released. April enchanted had so much more to offer! I found it much more real and earthly, the characters more credible to be "normal". At the end of the film, I felt the same as when I first saw the production of Pride and Prejudice by the BBC. I really wanted the characters to find what they were looking for: isolation, peace, freedom or love. You have the feeling that Italy is so far from everything it has known, that it is so decadent to take risks and leave behind everything that is colossal and constraining. But in the heat of spring in April, everyone's life relaxes and breaks down (in accordance with Victorian corsets) and is slowly rebuilt to the satisfaction of all. What a gem of a movie! How is it that he is not better known?
