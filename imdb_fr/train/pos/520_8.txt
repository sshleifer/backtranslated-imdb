My only minor minor inconvenience with the movie I grew up knowing that STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty minutes of the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER play beautifully as young lovers, but ROGER LIVESEY is the one who gives the most vivid and credible performance. The French accent MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even points out Technicolor) as a heavenly messenger sent to claim Niven when his death in wartime was not reported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the most spiritual lines and delivers them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> See tonight on TCM tonight for the first time in twenty years, I think it's a supreme example of the wonderful year 1946 movies. Technicolor photography, a bit discreet and not at all gaudy, is excellent and transforms into B & W for celestial sequences with a lot of imagination and efficiency. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is the one that really draws a spectator to the fantastic aspects of the story - and Niven's tense conversation with radio operator Hunter as his plane crashes into the air. Earth leads unexpectedly to a memorable romantic encounter. Really a wonderful movie from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
