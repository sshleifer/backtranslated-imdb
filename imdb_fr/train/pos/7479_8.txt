"Sweetness is never so sweet without acid." This quote was basically the theme of the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man to whom everything has been given in his life. He takes things for granted and it turns out perfectly in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and can not take a break to take a break in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really makes you stand back and look at your life and how you live it. You can not really appreciate the best things in life (sweet), like love, as long as you have not experienced evil (acid). The theme will really make you open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Only complaint, the film is very twisted at times and is difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you to watch and see for yourself.
