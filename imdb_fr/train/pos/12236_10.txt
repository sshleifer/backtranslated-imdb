I saw this film in 1959 when I was 11 in a movie theater drive with my family. <br /> <br /> At the time, I found it very funny. . . Even though I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie such a pleasure! I saw him this morning on "Turner South". Looking at him, I burst out laughing! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic that goes back to a bygone era. If you are too young to have lived the enchanting period of history that produced this film, I am really sorry for you. There is no way to watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) offer a "paradise" so delicious to "old players" like me. <br /> <br /> That said, I can only do respectfully ask that young people refrain from commenting on movies like "The Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Films like this one were shot for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. And as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? if you do not understand the issues covered by the movie, do not embarrass yourself by offering comments that ?? frankly ?? any sense.
