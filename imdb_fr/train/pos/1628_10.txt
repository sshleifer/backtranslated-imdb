It's the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. From the moment their fathers sent the four offenders to the Wienberg Military Academy, the tone is set and continues throughout this blazing film, and it does not drop for a second. <br /> <br /> It's hard to try to describe this film; the elements of humor are so remarkable and brilliantly thought that at first glance, they are nothing more than a stupid comedy of lust for teenagers of the 80s. But it's so much more than that! Straight out of the minds of MAD Magazine, Up the Academy offers a formula and style that I have never seen duplicated by any of the "hottest" Hollywood offers in recent years. Basically, the movie is so full of infantile baseball material that you might guess that the writers themselves were 14 years old. See this film if you like to act "immature". A classic. *****
