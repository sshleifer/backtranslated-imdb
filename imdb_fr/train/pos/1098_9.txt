Modern viewers mainly know this little movie as the model of the remake "The Money Pit". Older viewers watch the day with a hint of nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in an easier and less complicated era. Where was it? Time, of course, has a way of changing perspectives, and with so many films now ulcerated with social and political commentary, it is natural to wonder about the controversy over older, seemingly less provocative films. In M. Blandings builds his dream house ", so there may be something more than the public was looking for in 1948. There is a political comment, even subtle. Finding a home at the end of the 1940s was a truly maddening experience, hardly alleviated by the arrival of Levittowns, etc. Politics in the movie? Blanding's children always seem to talk about the progressive ideas they are taught at school (which in real life would make teachers accused of communism). In reality, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a democrat and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less an ardent democrat: he was married to MP Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom the young Richard Nixon accused of being soft for communism (and who had ruined it). Jason Robards, Sr., plays a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, junior, would be for many years a very active Liberal Democrat. Cary Grant, whose strident conservatism already reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already sliding, was almost one of the few characters to come out. But it was in 1948: Communism was a real threat and the blacklist was near. It will take another dozen years before political activism will reappear in mainstream films, and not so subtly.
