It is a racist film, but worthy of study and pleasure. For the first time, the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a sense of peace and tranquility, with her always at home on the verge of graduating high school, and he retires and retreats while waiting for inspiration to do something. For the second time, you realize how much the sister's husband is unhappy with his friends in the Backwoods blues bar. He takes it, that's what needs to be done these days, and the critical moment is as if they're discussing the weather. In this same scene, the sister's blues song is a real tearful if you are a little sensitive and like this kind of music. His performance resembles the climax of history; a blues story with the good guys being "people of color" in their element of backwoods, SC. Meanwhile, all the Whites in the film lead what appear to be shallow and insignificant lives, worthy of a baby. It's cool, as long as you recognize it as a fiction.
