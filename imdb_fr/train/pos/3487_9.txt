Wrestlemania 14 is not often considered one of the great Wrestlemania, but I would personally put it in my top 5, if it was not the top 3. It has so many great things, and it really marked the birth of The Era Attitude, which was The Best Era of WWE, in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and putting Austin as he did before going out was a pure class on his part. It has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see, and there is J.R and the King at their best bet! <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? royal battle team LOUD pop for the return of L.O.D. I'm not a fan of Battle Royal's, and that's another way. Very predictably, even when you see it for the first time, it is obvious that L.O.D would win. Looking at Sunny for about 8 minutes certainly helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka gets a surprising pop with his entry. Fast, high altitude and very exciting. If these two had had more time, they would surely have torn the roof, with their belongings. Taka wins with the driver Michinoku. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, is Chyna is handcuffed to Slaughter. Nice pop for Owen, mixed reaction for Trips. A really, really underrated match that is part of one of my favorites for Wrestlemania. The two have mixed very well and Owen can go with anyone. Trips wins, with interference from Chyna. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed match. Marc Mero & Sand Vs Goldust & Luna. Define the pop for Sand, never seen, for the woman. Sand looks really sexy and the crowd eats it! Constant Sable sings and she bursts almost every time she gets into the ring. Not bad for a mixed match, he had fun antics and was well spent. The Sable team wins when Sable hits the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock against rock | C |. Before rereading the match, I would like to note that The Rock showed its immense potential, with its interview with Jennifer Flowers, before his match. Beautiful pop for Shamrock, big heat for The Rock. Too disappointing, and I thought the ending was a bit silly, though Shamrock's antics are great to see and the public has gone crazy. Rock retains the title, when The Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Garbage dump for the WWF Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws . The Outlaws are not as finished as they would have been at that time. The crowd is actually a bit dead for that, but I thought she had some good hardcore pieces, with some sick looking bumps. Cactus and Terry win the titles at the end. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Kane. Big ovation for The Undertaker. Much better than participating in Wrestlemania 20, and for a Big Man vs. Big Man match, it was really good. It was an excellent total fight, The Undertaker taking a sick bump, across the table. WWE was smart, giving Kane a strong look even after his defeat. After two starts in graves, Taker finally ranks with a third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Enforcer special guest "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. The crowd is frightened for Austin, certainly one of the biggest hits I've heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. It's really a special match, one of the biggest major events in Wrestlemania history, you can tell when J.R is out of breath. HBK gives the best of itself, in what was to be his last match, and Austin has rarely been better. The animosity and electricity of the crowd are incredible, and it's as exciting as possible. Austin wins with the stunning, Tyson joining 3:16 while knocking out Michaels. The celebration victory of Austin is a marvel to see. One of the most mysterious spectators you'll ever see, said King, said King, said they were going crazy. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the best. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania and it's really the beginning of the era of attitude. It's very special for me, because it was the first Wrestlemania I ever saw, in '98. "The Austin era has begun!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
