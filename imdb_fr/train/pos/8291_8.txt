"The Lady in Question (1999)" with Gene Wilder is a well-executed crime drama that reminds me of Raymond Burr's old black and white series Perry Mason. Perry and "Cash" let me guess until the end. There were many suspects motivated by the murder, but I did not know what character it would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder is endowed with a charming and particular spirit, even in his facial expressions and his vocal inflections him perfect for the game. The parts of the film that describe the actors play very well. I'm sure the cast has an additional challenge. I'm not surprised to see that he wrote part of the film. Even his singing was a delight. I love him more in this role than in his former "ridiculous" roles such as "The Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope A & E will continue this series. They should call it something like "The mysteries of A & E Gene Wilder." <br /> <br /> The music corresponds to the period. I enjoyed the live combo and the swing tunes. At first, I was not sure if we were going back or whether the action was going on at that time. And I do not agree that the inclusion of blasphemy is necessary for the script's progress. For me, it always distracts me. <br /> <br /> Overall, my wife and I really enjoyed this second day well into what we hope to be many more - just like one of our other favorites: Raymond Burr is Perry Mason.
