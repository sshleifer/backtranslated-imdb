Like all other commentators, this film has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library looking for everything I could about this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. In spite of all that, all I could discover was that it was a story published in a newspaper from the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Fastward to 2002, after years of research on eBay every week base and lo and behold, a VHS copy of the movie. There was another bidder but I was determined to win this movie. The losing bidder wrote to me asking for a copy that I gave him. Despite the fact that I have a copy, I was still looking and finally I found a site selling a DVD copy of the film. You can find it at the following address: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
