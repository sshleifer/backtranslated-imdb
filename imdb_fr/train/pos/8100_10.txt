This film, in my opinion, is, despite its flaws (which I maintain are * a few *), an absolute masterpiece and a great and glorious work of art. <br /> <br /> What Mr. Bakshi did here is to create a truly magnificent film and showed his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films. He does not receive 1 / 100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. Without Mr. Bakshi, I do not think the animation would have survived Disney's onslaught. What's more, with The Lord of the Rings, he has not only created a beautiful animated film, but also a totally new art form - unfortunately an art form that has never completely lifted it off the ground. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscopy in the film (use of moving pictures that are used as background images and often animated using various techniques ranging from what appear to be small amounts of dye to full animation). But I think that people who complain about it simply can not accept an extraordinary form of art. No, it's not a Disney animation. No it's not a live action. No, it's not "cheating" - it's a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh, and so new that he feels comfortable in a tale as fantastic as "The Lord of the Rings". The innovative use of this technique by Bakshi brings to life the subtleties of Middle-earth in a very dark and mysterious way. In particular, the darkest creatures of Tolkien, especially the Nazgul, are made in such a way as to achieve. <br /> <br /> The scenario of Peter S. Beagle (very little based, as I understand it, on a first draft of Chris Conkling) is a very faithful adaptation of the works of Tolkien. Whenever possible, he uses dialogue directly in the novel and feels at home in the world created by Bakshi. Many cuts were made to match the first book and 3/4 in a single 2-hour, 15-minute movie, but very little change was made to the script. It would have been nice to fill a few holes: the reforging of Narsil, Galadriel's donations, the Huorns at the Battle of Hornburg, but, again, with the little time he had (already the longest animated film in history), they are certainly understandable (although it is difficult to ask how they could have been explained in a sequel). <br /> <br /> There is also the delicious score (one of my favorites) of Leonard Rosenman (who Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (whose result is clearly based on his work with LotR). bold and, dare I say, perfect.It is an orchestral triumph, but when it is associated with the images of the film, it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection.So far from the typical Hollywoodland cuisine that many people escape from it. <br /> <br /> The dubbers are wonderful.It should be noted that John Hurt embodies Aragorn and oozes the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The character design is also wonderfully unique, but not to everyone's taste, but remember that it's the adaptation director's job to show you what he / she imagines, not what you might have This is why Aragorn materializes in a distinct Amerindian atmosphere and Boromir appears in a costum It may not be what you imagined, but I can only congratulate Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he "saw". It can also be noted that he spent a lot of time with Priscilla Tolkien developing the character's outfits. </ P> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> the most subtle and beautiful sequences ever recorded on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down for a moment and his mastery is clearly demonstrated by the incredible tension he is able to create. Bakshi's artistic ability and Tolkien's incredible work blend into this sequence to give a glorious summit that has not yet been matched. <br /> <br /> The recent Warner Brothers DVD (2001) is sorely lacking. Although we can thank with all my heart that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package is sorely lacking supplements. As it would have been glorious to have had the comments of a director and to have been able to see the additional 20 minutes of film which had been suppressed for the exit in room. Another delicious addition could have been the assembly of the live action sequence that was later animated. The release of the DVD also contains the absolutely horrible voiceover at the end of the film, which is a change from the simple voice-over that occurred in the very last images of the film. This version is plastered and poorly rendered just on the musical climax of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy of all is that the sequel has never been done. We will never be able to see Bakshi's interpretation of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, the Cracks of Doom, the battle of Eowyn with the Witch-king or the confrontation of Gandalf with him. We will never be honored with the image of Bakshi of Denethor or Palatir or Paths of the Dead. It's unfortunate that we must finally accept the filmed version of Peter Jackson, the action movie of these later events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I guess it's better than not having a film version to all. <br /> <br /> David
