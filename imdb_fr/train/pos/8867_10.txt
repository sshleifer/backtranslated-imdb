I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby will be released on DVD one day. The episode with George, his quirky eccentric brother (played by the late Roscoe Lee Browne), is a classic hilarity. This reflects the classic rivalry between brothers and sisters and the love between brothers whose lives have taken different paths but have been happy. <br /> <br /> Cosby and Mrs. Rashad brilliantly took over the chemistry they shared at the Cosby Show for many years. Their role in the middle class shows the dimensions they can take as artists. <br /> <br /> The list of comic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... a classic genius!
