Having never seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this film on a clean slate. And I must say that I really appreciated. Of course, some of Sondre Locke's actors made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was the 80's. But even if you can not get around it (and I could not get it) or his revenge killings ( who seemed a little ... excessive; P), it's worth it, just for Dirty Harry. Or at the very least, the bull he affectionately calls 'MeatHead': P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
