I've watched a lot of cold episodes over the years, starting with season one episodes in 2003-2004. And while most were good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but it had few rivals in the Emmy categories. Although some may disagree with the content of the story (for example, the relationship between men), I doubt that anyone can look at it without being deeply touched by their spirit. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a case story that has been reopened, based on the testimony of a dying drug dealer. The two main actors are two police officers in the 1960s, Sean Coop (aka the victim of the cold affair that bears his Coop family name) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In history, Coop is single, a veteran of the Vietnam War with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married and has no children. Both are partners in the police force and form not only a friendship, but also a secret love affair that they must hide from a deeply homogenous and obviously homophobic culture at the time. <br /> <br /> The scenes back in their lives are mostly black and white, with pieces of color now and then sprinkled everywhere. Examples include their red team car, the yellow curtains that grow softly near the window of Jimmy's room, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight, and then kiss while they were in a state caused by alcohol. I found it interesting that only the selected elements are colored in the scenes back, with everything else in black and white. I still do not understand the color scheme and the reasoning. <br /> <br /> The obviously homophobic tension between police colleagues and the two central actors only reinforces the intensity of the episode. A key emotional scene occurred when Coop was confronted with his father after Jimmy's baby baptism. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected officer in the force, confronts Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One may feel sorry for Coop at this point, when his father's shame and disgrace fell on Coop. "You are not going to dishonor our family ... and you are not my son either." - a clear indication of hostile views on same-sex relationships of that time. <br /> <br /> An additional tension can also be seen in the police cloakroom where Coop and another policeman are attacking them after the names of Coop and Jimmy were labeled "Batman and Robin Homos" . <br /> <br /> Regarding the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious that Coop wanted more Jimmy in his life. Once Jimmy realizes the tension, he must choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church and his unwavering dedication to Coop. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jimmy moves away from Coop, realizing that he can not have both Coop and his family. Unfortunately, Coop is killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of police drug money and corruption that have reached the upper echelons of strength. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene Throughout this episode, Coop, while dying from gunshot wounds in his squad's car, quietly exchanged his last words on the radio. the police with his partner: "Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones, do not forget it." <br /> <br /> The selection of the soundtrack was exceptional throughout the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with the actor Chad Everett, in which I play Jimmy, still sad, and still missing a lot from his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this episode and consider it the best. This is without a doubt all the episodes of Cold Case that I have ever seen and which are the best written, the most well played and the most successful.
