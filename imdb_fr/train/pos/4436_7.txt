The Tattooed Stranger is one of the few BBC films that BBC2 screened for the Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also They Live By Night and The Brighton Strangler. <br /> <br /> In this one, a man walking his dog in Central Park meets an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. She was shot and the police then tried to identify her with a tattoo as the main clue. After being identified, the murderer is discovered and shot dead at the end of the shooting. <br /> <br /> Most of this film was shot on the site of New York and its surroundings. we do not normally see, especially in the alleys. <br /> <br /> Most of the unknowns are part of the cast, John Miles headlining. <br /> <br /> The tattooed foreigner is worth looking for. Excellent but rather obscure. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
