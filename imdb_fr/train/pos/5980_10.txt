First of all, it's really my favorite movie. I do not need to give a description to anyone because every hole ** does it. I'm literally obsessed with these lame effects, virtually bloodless, having a '80s metal horror masterpiece', showing a boom-stick '. The director (I heard) was hoping for a box office success to be able to make sequels and get a FREDDY / JASON transaction type. Damn, I wish it had happened like this! The soundtrack bangs. The acting is good ... CHECK THIS MOFO. and all hardcore fans, feel free to send emails and chat. Midgetorgy .... I can be found at YAHOO.
