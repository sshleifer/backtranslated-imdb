Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varied qualities, but most of the films he made in his homeland are indisputable masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic (and bisexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful, rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the beautiful lover of the woman. Meanwhile, the writer is plagued by strange visions. At first, they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but he soon begins to realize that he is currently experiencing a kind of premonition. Hitchcockian thriller fascinating, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you think they're about something, but then you realize they're about something completely different. This is one of those movies. A thriller during the first half and a quasi-religious surreal saga during the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people going to church every Sunday. Great cinematography of the future director Jan de Bont. Strongly recommended!
