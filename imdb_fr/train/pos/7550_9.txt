Sensational. A truly fantastic travel movie that contains tons of super surreal images, dark intent and a black, rather strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world. It is populated by a group of very cute characters out of the world who bend and flow with distorted bottoms. Like any cool fantasy, the wandering intrigue is secondary to the stunning visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they meet the dead, the deluge, the water elephants, the samurai swordsmen and the pigs who fish. I had never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminded me of the American cartoonist's pencil work; Bill Plympton. It's a delight for fans of strange and pretty things and it stuck me on the screen for fear of missing something incredible. In short, it's "Hello Kitty" without the "o".
