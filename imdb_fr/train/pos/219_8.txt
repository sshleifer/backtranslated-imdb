Simon's carefully written dialogues are really electrified by Matthau and Burns. You can literally hear the script crack. Few films can develop such a relationship between the actors and the scenario. For example, the famous meeting scene could have been much duller with lower quality actors involved. Matthau seems to have been born to play Willie Clark (of course, Oscar moreso in Odd Couple), and with all the little idiosyncracies and ways in which Matthau mixes with the character (the line where he claims to be with him since he lives in the city while Lewis lives in the country that Lewis is "disconnected" is the prime example) make it one of the best performances I've ever seen of an actor in any role, be it in comedy or the drama or anything else. Period. Matthau and Burns work together perfectly; the contrast they illustrate accentuates Simon's superb talent for creating a comic conflict. This film is simply one of the ultimate "must-see" and requires a prestigious place in the pages of the film's history.
