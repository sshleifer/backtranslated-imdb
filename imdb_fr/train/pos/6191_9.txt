It seems that Hal Hartley's films are a bit of a hit with most audiences. This film will be no exception to this rule. Fay Grim is the sequel to Hartley's "Henry Foole" from 1998. This time, the focus is on Henry's ex-wife (incarnated to perfection by the always-welcome Parker Posey). his shady business. In the meantime, Fay finds himself on an odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc. The film gets bogged down a bit in the second half. If you have been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is an event not to be missed. For the novice Hartley beginner who has only heard of his cinematographic technique, you can take a look at his previous films before taking care of it (especially if you have not yet seen Henry). I admired the work of the camera, which sometimes reminded me of some of Man Ray's photographs.
