I watched this series when she first came out in the 70s. I was 14 years old and I looked at my best friends because my dad did not want to watch it. It became a weekly ritual every Sunday, and like saying that for two fourteen-year-olds, watching a documentary in almost reverent silence must mean that it was something special. <br /> <br /> The wide range of events of the Second World War makes it a difficult subject to document.so policy makers broke down the topic into what they considered to be the most significant key events and dedicated an episode to each. Some episodes have covered long periods such as the "pack of wolves", which covered almost six years of the Battle of the Atlantic. from Stalingrad had an episode on its own. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be made today simply because most of the people interviewed are dead. The list of important actors mentioned above gives an incredible insight into the thinking of the time. Anthony eden the secretary for foreign affairs, Carl donnitz, Albert Speer, confident animal architect and later minister of arms for Hitler. In one of the last episodes, we see Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, who was accompanying him in the bunker and he dictated it to her. she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and escaped by the Russian lines. These and many others play a major role in the realism of the events described. <br /> <br /> if I have any criticisms to make about the series is that the code breakers bletchly park are not included but the revelations from them in the war only appeared when the series has been made, so I can not blame the programmers. <br /> <br /> the first titles and the music is beautiful, and the story of Lawrence Olivier gives a natural gravity to the scenario. <br /> <br /> the best documentary series ever made? without a doubt. Do not miss
