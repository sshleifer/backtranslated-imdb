I love this show, it's sure to be a winner. Jessica Alba is doing a great job, it's time for us to have an impetuous girl who is not cute. The entire cast is beautiful and all episopes have good conspiracies. Everything is well laid out and thoughtful. It must have taken a while, because it was not a rushed person who simply slapped something. It's a great show altogether.
