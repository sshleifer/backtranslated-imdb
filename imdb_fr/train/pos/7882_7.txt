"Ship Ahoy" was probably created to showcase MGM's talent. The film is a fun trip on a steamer en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at a time when the country was involved in the Second World War. It was a typical studio dish, which offered the film a light distraction as a distraction during the country's difficult times. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell is at its best in music. where she shows us clearly that she was a dancer with whom to count. Red Skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too many clowns, as he pursues the beautiful Mrs. Powell on the ship that brings them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show that he was a funny man. Virginia Gray is also seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers featuring Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in which we see, among others, the amazing Buddy Rich, who has some solos with Mr. Dorsey and Ms. Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as the group's lead singer, supported by the Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre, which MGM has totally controlled.
