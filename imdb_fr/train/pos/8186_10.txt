I love Satan Pit !!! David Tennant is such a great actor and Billie Piper too !!! Who else loves Will Thorp in pieces ??? He's so cute, is not he? I hated the pieces where he was possessed by the devil and where he had been told to "go to hell", as Rose so rightly said. Mind you, he was quite funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, do you want to shut up!" Mr. Jefferson was so brave, was not he? To die to save others. I felt really sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh my god, if I were Rose, I would be so scared for him." And when she took him in his arms, I was like "grrrrrr, he's mine! Pass me!" but I thought it was really nice. And the doctor ... well, I thought he was going to tell Ida "Tell Rose I love her" but he did not do it. Never mind.
