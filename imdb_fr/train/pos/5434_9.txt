The film was shot at Movie Flats, just off Route 395, near Lone Pine, California, north of the road to Whitney Portals. You can still find splashes of cement and iron joists glued to the rocks where the decorations were built. And you'll recognize the area of ​​any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> The plot does not bother me, because I'm sure it's covered elsewhere. The film features three athletes - Fairbanks Jr., who must have learned a lot from his father - Grant, an acrobat in his youth - and MacLaughlin, a South African professional boxer. Their physical abilities are all exposed. <br /> <br /> Not a moment of this film should be taken seriously. It is Thugees, a sect in India, hence our English word "thug". I can not review all the congratulations of this film, but I should probably point out that the director, George Stevens, was a polymath with experience in Laurel and Hardy's films - see his choreography of fight scenes - and continued to the infinitely long dissolves of Shane and Anne Frank's diary. The dynasties grew and fell. Geological epochs came and went, while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed in "A place in the sun". Here, in comic mode, he excels. <br /> <br /> This is a story of male bonds and it would be easy - too easy - to read heroicism, as many people do with Howard Hawks. Or the hatred of women. But that's not it at all. Sometimes, the elements presented on the screen do not deserve too much heuristic attention. Men will bond by working together differently than women. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, no one is an anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. For most of human history - about nine tenths of it - hominids have been hunters and gatherers, and men tend to hunt and women to gather. Hunting is more effective as a team enterprise. The men who were not very good at bonding were Darwinians, which left men who had a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaughlin are absolutely right. <br /> <br /> Sorry to talk about evolution, but I am an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. Did I ever tell you about the Vaitongi horse in Samoa who slipped on the cement and fell into the tub with me? You must watch the hooves. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is adorable, really. I only got to know her in her later years and I wondered why she was in so many movies. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister, Olivia De Havilland, grew up and went to a convent school. Nice place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this frantic and adventurous chronicle of British Empah at its peak, you must never forgive yourself. It's so famous that it's parodied in Peter Sellers' movie, "The Party". Yes, the colonel must know.
