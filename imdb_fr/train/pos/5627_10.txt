This movement made me jump out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do! The acting was the best, Farrah should have earned an Oscar for it, she was fabulous. James Russo was so good that I hated him and he played beautifully. There are not many movies that have riveted me like this one. The casting was great. Alfie seemed shocked by those big eyes. Farrah looked like a victim and you relive her horror as you walk through her. Farrah made you feel like you were there and you felt the same anger she wanted you to hurt her, but you also knew it was the wrong thing to do. The film made you rollercoaster and you went up and down with each scene.
