It is so rare to find a literary work correctly translated on the screen that I could give this film a higher score than it deserves, but not much. A long-time student of Vonnegut's works, I do not hesitate to recommend the film to its readers, at least to those who love it as much as I do. The cast is inspired: Nolte is sober in triumph, disconcerted in defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is succulent, but her handling of the treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo make you almost forget her beauty. Alan Arkin delivers a Soviet spy quite adorable, but just as treacherous. <br /> <br /> Do not feel obliged to read Mother Night to enjoy the movie; however, if you have not read Mother Night, you will probably want to watch it after the movie. <br /> <br /> Note the transition from color to black and white and vice versa, and do not miss the final symbolism of Campbell's string. Also watch Kurt Vonnegut's cameo near the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I write in mid-December, when the song starts playing on the radio, and it drives me crazy).
