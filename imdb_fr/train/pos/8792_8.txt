An entertaining film about kung fu, with acting, script and fight scenes well above average. All actors are friendly characters and qualified martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comic antics are fun to watch, and his austere companion has a particularly impressive talent. For me, the only flagrant defect of the film is the size of the cast - sometimes things get a bit confusing as the film gives way and changes between different subplots, and some characters are not as fleshy as we would like . . <br /> <br /> But a kung-fu movie must be judged above all on the quality of the action, and the Shaolin Temple keeps its promises. The film culminates with a battle that allows each character to show his talents against a deserved opponent. <br /> <br /> Overall, Shaolin Temple is a low budget and enjoyable kung fu movie. Not at the height of a good Jet Li movie, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Miscellaneous Notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video release I saw was (probably) badly dubbed and lacked full credits for casting and the team.
