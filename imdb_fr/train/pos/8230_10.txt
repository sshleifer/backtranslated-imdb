Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about the small crimes that everyday people commit everyday, who, in a foolish scenario, could lead to an absolute disaster. One of the most intelligent Greek series of all time! Actors like Kitt Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and their talent and gave us moments of incredible "guilty" laughter. Every viewer seemed to recognize the bad side of himself in one of the characters or at least one side of himself he would like to have. Actors of all ages who have played bigger and smaller roles have gained an equally important place in the hearts of the Greek public. My personal favorites (apart from the first two that I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but many amazing actors have gone through some episodes. sometimes. Everyone in the world who understands Greek should find a way to watch this series, even if it's been over 5 years on television. In Greece, they constantly repeat the series (ANT1) whenever there is a summer zone or early afternoon. We will never forget Eglimata or any of the cast members!
