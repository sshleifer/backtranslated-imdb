I entered The Straight Story hoping for a sad / happy character drama with a beautiful staging and good acting. What I did not expect was an allegory of the trials of human existence. Let Lynch tell you a simple story about a 300-mile journey with a lawn mower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. <br /> <br /> If you do not notice it, look at it again, pay attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's going through, the reactions he's giving him, the kind of discussions he has (one of the first concerns pregnancy and children, one of the latter is outside a cemetery). The last route he takes is particularly haunting in this context as it shrinks and his fear and nervousness intensify. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of its motor regarding a life after death, in which it achieves the desired meeting. <br /> <br /> I only hope that some of those who have called it a slow and winding melodrama takes the time to look with more holistic attention.
