It's a real "80s film": at the time, they shot maybe 100 times more films than today, which makes them very interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon, which does not exist anymore. Nowadays, maybe the same kind of people who would have made cheap "direct video" movies in the eighties make cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. Anyway, it's above the average level of the trash movie: it has a good, fascinating story, and it's pretty well done, I think. In a scene, you can even see the microphone tilt over the top edge of the photo. Of course, there are also small cameos from Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the "success" of the film, although they are good in their small roles. The monster, the heavy singer "Sammi Curr", really looks terrible, especially when he sings. One of the scariest monsters I've seen in horror movies. I can have nightmares from him next night. Not recommended for the cinephiles intellectuals.
