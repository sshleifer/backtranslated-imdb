What a fantastic and fantastic movie "Stardust" is. <br /> <br /> I could easily finish it by this single statement and just say it, we could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems to want to force remakes and sequels, "Stardust" reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a few hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with the joy of a child that we all yearn for. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. He has the damsel in distress, the hero, the thieves, the obstacles, the spells, the antidotes, the charms and even a touch of speed to make it almost modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from the city of Wall, which is conveniently located next to a wall that separates their city from a magical kingdom. The only way around the wall is to go through a breech carefully guarded by an old scruffy ragman (beautifully played by David Kelly). One day, a Wall young man named Ben Barnes maneuvered the old guard and escaped by the breech. He meets an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a young woman chained (and very sexy) called Una. She is held captive by a witch and kept on a leash by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is gone, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later, he is summoned to the culasse of the wall where the old guard gives him what you can expect: a boy. <br /> <br /> The boy, named Tristan, becomes a rather unlucky young man (Charlie Cox) who is seduced by a girl very out of his league and also engaged to another. Nevertheless, the young woman (named Victoria and having played Sienna Miller) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love to him. After seeing a shooting star, she tells him that he can get it if he gets the star and brings it back to him. He accepts and embarks on his quest that will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile in the realm of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who will succeed him on the throne. The names of his sons are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. The other sons were killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he throws his ruby ​​charm to the sky and that's what brings the star to the earth. <br /> <br /> The star crushes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she carries the charm of course. But she does not know that she is now persuaded by Tristain, the princes, but also by an old witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut the heart of her star to find her own youth. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes. But everything happens as the adventure unfolds. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by his dedication to Victoria that he does not recognize the growing bond that binds him to Yvaine. Her initial interest lies solely in Yvaine's return to Victoria as proof of her love. But he must first pass before the princes and Lamia. Princes are not a big problem because they are constantly trying to kill themselves - and as in "Pirates of the Caribbean" - never has death been so funny. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also meets the witch who enslaved his mother (although he does not know it's his mother) and a group of pirates led by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> the most important character of the film and DeNiro plays it thoroughly. It steals the film with its harshness and soon we learn a secret under cover that will leave the audience on the ground laughing. Although his role is small, DeNiro is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is gorgeous in the role of Lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is quite appropriate as Yvaine confused and afflicted. She makes a perfect miss. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett, and Mark Strong add a dose of perfect levity as fighting princes who, after their death, come back as ghosts like "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> Director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other experience as a director was "Layer Cake", is an enchanting story that will please everyone. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" may be too complex for young children, but for those over 13 will want to see this movie several times. It's that good. "Stardust" is what the movies are supposed to be. Perfectly written, perfectly interpreted, perfectly directed and perfectly played. In other words ... perfect.
