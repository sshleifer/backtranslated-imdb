A very raw and courageous portrayal of part of the history of the Second World War, which most of us in the United States never had a clue. I would like to have this on video. It has only been shown on the vt. once, as far as I know, back in 89 or 90. I asked for this movie, and most video stores do not even know it. Great actresses all around, I wish I could see him again. Top Notch Series.
