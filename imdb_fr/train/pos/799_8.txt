he is the narcissist and manipulator par excellence; in this case, portraying the lawyer (and the murderer) Tom Capano. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Morris is compassionate as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but at first she is a little too victimized. We are sorry for the situation, but are simultaneously disgusted after seeing her victim being victimized by several other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> What is sad is where she gets help to value herself. problems, and Capano had his psychologist killed. It's hard to believe, but it was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a cameo with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as the mother of Capano. All in all, it's an interesting story because it's based on real murder and you'll want to read Ann Rule's book for specific details. 8/10.
