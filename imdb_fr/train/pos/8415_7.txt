If "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and German Expressionist cinema), this film before the First World War is the grandfather. The titular student, hungry in an empty garret, makes an agreement with the devil - the devil gives him a bottomless bag of gold, in exchange for "nothing in this room". The devil chooses the reflection of the student in his mirror. He goes off with the student's doppelganger, who commits crimes of which the student is blamed. <br /> <br /> The film is marred by certain limitations stemming from the technically primitive state of 1913; The plot claims effects of chiaroschuro, but the film is necessarily shot almost in the light of day. But the scene where the reflection comes out of the mirror is still waves. <br /> <br /> More interesting for the trends it reveals, the student from Prague is always worth it.
