This highly derivative movie will be fun for many who have not seen some of the darkest animated movies. I enjoyed most, especially after the opening minutes of the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the best animation elements). James Garner as commander and Leonard Nimoy as king give impressive performances.
