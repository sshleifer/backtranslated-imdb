Could this film have been one of those ordinary "soap operas" about the daily events of half a dozen families whose lives are intimately linked? the discovery of a baby thrown under bushes! What a mix of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond these daily events and asks questions to consider, even if there is no satisfactory answer. He asks: in this chaotic world, things happen, is it just lucky when everything goes well or, from a fatalistic perspective, is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and to participate as well and its future takes a new perspective? Most of us have experienced this unusual experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super-ego that makes us believe that we are so important? As a character says? Once seated on the edge of the Grand Canyon, he realized how incredibly small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movies, but a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is remarkable in a friendly role.
