The story is a bit difficult to follow the first time, but it's only because of all the vampires / witches painted naked 70s dancing on the bongo drums. Of course, this is interrupted by some vampiric orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and their uses. And for girl on girl, vampiric or not ... this movie is great !!!
