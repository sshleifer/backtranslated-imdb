All movie critics and metal fans hated this movie but I enjoyed it. I saw it somewhere on TV somewhere and was amazed by the scene where Sammi goes on stage and plays Fastway's Trick or Treat. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was typical of the 80s. This guy is driven by bullies and asks for supernatural help to defeat bullies but goes too far and must be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt from Melrose Place chooses Skippy from Family Ties so Skippy gets a story from Gene Simmons' Tony Fields to comfort him and all the breaks in hell are lost, the highlight being where Tony sings (lip sync) and dances on a metal song before the shyt hits the fan. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes and other things but the music and the overall imaging was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
