Although the elements of the plot of "The Eighth Day" seem to have been made many times, the film still has much of the spark, mystery and symbolism of Jaco Van Dormal's first film. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always remain on my favorites list, the film still leaves us many emotions. Daniel Auteil, of "The Closet" of 2001, insipid, minimizes his role, fearing to react too much (rightly, the role could easily have been ruined if the actor had been too dramatic). However, I felt that the game needed a little more realism, putting more emphasis on the character himself rather than on his growth. <br /> <br /> Do not venture into this movie hoping for a dark humor and unexpected twists. you have received from "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still serves as a decent film, if not flawless,
