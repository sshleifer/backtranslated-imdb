In 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoons was certainly at its peak. Series like Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular and now, Disney has made another great cartoon, which gave birth to the Disney afternoon. This drawing is called TaleSpin. This is the old character from the jungle book, Baloo the Bear, who works in the aircraft sector. In the series, he meets Kit Cloudkicker, the former Air Pirate and a good surfer on the cloud, businesswoman Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very entertaining and contains tons of word games that you may not understand when you were a child, but that you will understand later. It's a cleverly written series that is good to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy this for your kids instead of letting them watch all those awful Nickelodeon cartoons. If you liked TaleSpin, check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Make it turn!
