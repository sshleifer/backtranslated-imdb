I saw this film about a week ago and I still think about it. I was very moved by this movie. I found the characters very credible and friendly, almost because of a fault. Like in real life, even if sometimes people are disappointed, as was the case of Leo who, although I loved his character, I could not have been more disappointed when he was ready to have sex not protected while being fully aware of its HIV status. I was also disappointed by Leo's rejection of the drugs at his disposal and the awful way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him home by train. I think this film shows very well why the HIV rate among young homosexual men is on the rise. This is not meant to criticize gays (I am gay) and a film could have been made about a young heterosexual who makes bad choices and seems to ignore the consequences for himself and others. The only part of the film that I did not understand was why the (gay friendly) family did not want to include Marcel in Leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message of this film is that, whether it's gay or straight, DO NOT HAVE AN UNSECTED SEX!
