It's worth looking at, especially with the kindness of an honest reporter, you're expecting a long story as Gray Owl is portrayed as a fraud, but that does not have to be and adds to the generally optimistic theme and drama of history and film. <br /> <br /> This must be Brosnan's best performance to date, he admirably convinces as an English boy playing Indians. The scene that stands out is the return to his? Aunts? where Brosnan and the two older actresses form a wonderful scene full of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue, just with expressions and a good direction. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known and the message so universal and especially important, it is a shame that this film is not better recognized. Maybe in the end, he will become a bit of a classic and sleeper. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done, Dickie Attenborough.
