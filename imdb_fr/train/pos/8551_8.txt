Ti% s and As *, a lot of crazy people. Some great characters, fun pranks and a staged action for teenagers in this version of the Amercan Pie franchise. It really looks like the old school. It looks a bit like Porkys for the 2000s. Some very entertaining characters combined with very humorous situations make this a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Although the original cast has practically disappeared, with the exception of one, this film really seemed entertaining to me. Do not be too excited, you have to take it for booby teen comedy, but for what it is, it excels. The characters are nice and funny, girls are hotter than hell. The fun and the games are hilarious, with stuff I've never seen in comedies, they make me cringe while laughing. <br /> <br /> Ignore the enemies and give them a chance to see what you see. you think. Do not expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and catch your attention for about an hour.
