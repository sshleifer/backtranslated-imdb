ELVIRA, THE MASTER OF SHADOW (1988) <br /> <br /> directed by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> with: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg > <br /> conspiracy: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her TV show and goes to the small Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes, to collect the inheritance of her dead aunt, hoping to earn a lot of money to open a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a scary old house, a poodle and a magic cookbook. In Fallwell, Elvira is trying to earn money, give teens a little life, win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene), avoid burning at the stake and keep the recipe book from his scary uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard), who intends to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful woman, beautiful and funny, and as Elvira, she is all that, more morbid and hilarious naive, without forgetting to possess a surprising pair of knockers. In this film, his charms are used wisely. <br /> <br /> I loved the feeling of "fish out of the water" in the movie. You have Elvira, with her deep black dress, her big black hair and huge "twins," and she's in a Christian city where most girls are not even allowed to wear makeup. It also makes his love affair with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is just as awesome as Elvira's uncle / foe, Vincent, who wants to steal the book and use it for evil. He is very present but still does not hinder and does not steal the scenes of Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror usurpation is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything that happens in a sequel to SCARY MOVIE. I heard that this film contained about 56 jokes of busts, and any fan of horror B movies by Roger Corman would love the parody of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Elvira, you'll love this movie. Also take a look at HVNTED HILLS.
