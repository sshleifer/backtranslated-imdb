This show is a beautiful story. This includes everything from slavery to the way they were treated, to religion, to the means of hiding the Jews, to the inquisition, to the belief in the African gods Orisha, and to the way in which women, including the girls, were treated. Even until homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined and that Violante, this character saddens me. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her. I am so happy that they decided to republish it on t.v. again. Although I would like to see the unedited version. Xica became my heroine. I look at how she uses her power to help all those who seek her. I love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. I wait for my Xica impatiently every night. It would be nice to double it in English so that the Americans could like it too.
