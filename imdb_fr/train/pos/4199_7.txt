The only thing that upsets me in this movie is that the DVD is so expensive. For now, it's too much for my budget or I would buy it because the movie is a good example of a movie noir ... and I like to watch Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion produces excellent DVDs, but the asking price is sometimes a bit high. This is the case here for a mono and 80-minute film in black and white that is good but is not extraordinary, from a cinematographic point of view. <br /> <br /> The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, scenery, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently finds itself with a spy microfilm in his possession after stealing Peters's handbag. (Say it three times!) Everyone except Peters is a credible character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, American agents and communists and, in particular, Ritter as "Moe", an informant. Widmark and she are the stars of this movie. <br /> <br /> Peters does a decent job playing the cheap floozy, but quickly loses his credibility by "falling in love with Widmark" at the first meeting, even if he's mean. to her. Only in the world of the film !! Too bad, because this ridiculous love story takes him away. <br /> <br /> This is a mean black film that means good, but not extraordinary and certainly not worth buying at a price of $ 25 to $ 35. For this price, we could do much better on the black film market.
