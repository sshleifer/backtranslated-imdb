Solino really touched me with his deeply drawn characters. While it was a simple story of rivalry between two brothers, it was not just about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was how I could relate to the feelings that Gigi was experiencing, especially when he had to take his mother to his hometown in Italy and fail to attend. award ceremony of the film in which his film was engaged. Seeing this character who struggled so much between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end, when he made one last attempt to reach out to his father, he was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never go beyond their walls to touch their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother who, while being the surer brother of him and older, had so many insecurities. A very beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
