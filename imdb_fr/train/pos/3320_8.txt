I liked this film, cute and funny.I found this family film. The dirtiest part of this movie was the reference to the New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox Nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Sorry to say that to the Yankees fans.I recommend this picture to the whole family.Of course, with your typical love / comedy film, there is a long time in the film, with whom I am in love and what I do, but the film makes up for that with all the wacky moments. The movie show is a few moments of how the Red Sox Nation (at Fenway Park) how fans felt about Sox's 86-year-old always messed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love with another human go together.
