What is the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I have just watched this film and that the images are still etched deep in my brain - and I do not think they will move anytime soon. <br /> <br /> It is probably fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea of ​​the nature of the film, even if you have not seen it. If not, let me warn you that this is not a budget jewel that has been lost for a few years in the "Quasi-noir", or a low budget, schlocky, "fun movie ". What is a low-budget art, presented in a simple but poignant way. The idea is simple: seven stories that turn around and end with suicides interspersed with images of a decaying corpse. Sounds simple, even boring? It's not. Words can not really describe the power of this film when you're halfway there; it virtually drives you, whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I could take a tour here to discuss the technical advantages and disadvantages of management; perhaps highlight that the scenes are obviously shot with super-8 cameras and are sometimes shaking. I could point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync to compete with all of Fulci's movies, but by the end of the day, all of that sounds insignificant. <br /> <br /> In extreme films, I've seen the hardest of them, and yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few people have succeeded, even if it's not not particularly bloody and has very few scenes that I would call "free". In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I will not spoil this, I would just say that the emotional agony of the character drips almost on the screen and makes you sympathize, even aspire to an end. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not the best movie of all time, and in many places it sounds brutal and maybe a bit amateurish, but despite these flaws, Der Todesking is a experience that I would recommend to anyone who loves difficult cinema. If you like to look comfortable or watch "beautiful" movies, or if you just want to insult something brutal and useless, that's not what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not, it's the one you will not forget for so soon.
