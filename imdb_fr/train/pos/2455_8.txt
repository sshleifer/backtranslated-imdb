It's a pretty good film, but too Americanized in its predictability. Change the Kung Fu for football and the Turkish family to Pakistani and watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene by scene. An interesting feature of the film is the progression of fighting with the mysterious ninja under the highway, starting with miserable losses and progressing slowly until the last fight is a victory against oneself, said the master of Kung Fu Many times. At another level, Danish life is revealed in a very different way than it is from outside: non-native immigrants who make up a large part (in fact, the majority) of Danish citizens, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, the provocations of the immigrant girl in the begging of the film. All describe an image different from the one we think of when we hear the word Denmark.
