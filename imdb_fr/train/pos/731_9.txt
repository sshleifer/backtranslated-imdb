This movie is so funny !!! The acting is WONDERFUL, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is what every high school student dreams of doing at his school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack and the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, you'll love this movie. This movie is a bit "greased" esk (without all the boring songs). The sung songs are nice; you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is finished. This music is the second largest musical comedy (the second next to the blues brothers). But please, do not consider it a full-fledged musical; Since the songs are so nice, it's hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene. I think of this movie more like a comedy with nuances of romance. You will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will remember your old high school after seeing this movie. Highly recommended for both the family (since it is young, but also for adults, because there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience.
