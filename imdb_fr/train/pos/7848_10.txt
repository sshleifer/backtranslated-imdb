It's one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. It's not just a fun movie or a well done movie. This is an important step in the art of animation and, even if it was not the case, the only technique used to achieve it would give it a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz has created a stop-motion film about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with jobs, houses, discos, cinemas, even small accessories such as posters, bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> In this film, he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly, much to the chagrin of a grasshopper; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot. Mr. Beetle goes home and finds that Ms. Beetle has her own business. Mr. Beetle chases the lover but forgives his wife. Both wear makeup and go to the movies. And the movie they watch is Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly. Described thus, it seems banal, but once seen, it becomes a striking work of the cinema. With Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz has pretty much invented everything the future animators would use in their work. For this reason, it must not be forgotten.
