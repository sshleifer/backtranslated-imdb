The usual antics of the cat and the mouse abound until Jerry dives into an invisible ink bottle. He has the brilliant idea of ​​torturing Tom without him knowing it. The cat becomes wise and tries to do things to make him see, even if it is not foolproof. Of course, Jerry puts Butch, aka Killer, aka Spike, the dog in the act (although he is late in the short film and his contribution is minimal) Brilliant, this animated short film reminded me that of the white mouse that scares Tom so much. . Most gags work and are as violent as a real man and jerry shorts. This hilarious comic is on the disc, one of the DVDs from the Spotlight collection of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My rating: B +
