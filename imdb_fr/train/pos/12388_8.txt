I read the book and I must say that this film remains true to its form. I think it's the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as a leading role and Burgess Meredith is an excellent supporting role in the role of next door neighbor. I have seen this film at least twice and I think I will buy the book and the film for my collection. The suspense only gets worse until the end of the climate, the turn that you will never see coming. If you like movies like Signs and The Village, The Sentinel will be a classic prelude. In addition, what is interesting, it is the actors of the film. You would not recognize them if you did not read the credits. The late Jerry Orbach is an excellent sales manager and Jeff Goldblum is an excellent photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is underrated but excellent.
