It's a good movie. I love him more every time I look. Most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but the mysterious men have such integrity in writing and characterizing that to watch again - while Ben Stiller cries under the hood ornament of the limousine , or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush shows his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles watching the report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens - it's a pleasure. It's a perfect ensemble game. The story develops directly and consistently, the sequences of action are creative and not too dominant, all montages bearing in the end. Seriously, if you've seen it for a while, look at it again, and if you have not started yet. You can not look at it until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the test scene, too many good things!)
