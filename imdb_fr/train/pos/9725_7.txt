"How to lose friends and alienate people" is not based on the infidelities of Tiger Woods. This is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book about her celebrity-journalist experiences. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a zany British journalist who works in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Young is eager to get caught up in all sorts of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence the title of the film. He is tumultuous, daring and stupid. But nevertheless for a very strange reason, he is a rather nice character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, composer Alison Olsen, admirably portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney aspires mainly to sexpot actress Sophie Maes performed by the fantastic Ms. Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short on the skill of acting, but high on the "eye candy" material. Sidney throws himself into all kinds of deceit to climb the ranks of the reporters in the magazine co. These are the comic moments of the film. However, I think that director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan risk losing viewers and alienating genuine rom-com documents by developing an unlikely romantic plot between Sidney and Alison; Although the Weidstraughan team has made a different entertaining story. Pegg has assimilated his character through his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges was again building "The Dude" bridges with his enigmatic support work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's sublime prez. But the rest of the movie was not worthy enough to be shown here. "How to lose friends and alienate people" should not be completely insane, but you risk losing friends at the movies if you publish it as a super romantic comedy. *** Average
