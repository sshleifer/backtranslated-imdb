This film was very well played in 1932 and probably would not work as well today because its style was a little outdated and artificial. However, if you are the type of person, like me, who loves old Hollywood movies, you reduce the film slightly and you can enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The film is put in a service for problem pregnancies. In this large room are half a dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth - but doctors are worried about possible complications (yeah - such a play would really traumatize mothers!). And, as in an episode of "Love Boat" or "Fantasy Island", every mother has her own story. With so many extreme and crazy stories, you must suspend unbelief. I could and enjoyed the movie a bit. <br /> <br /> Here are some stories: One involves a father. You do not see the mother, but it's a very, very nervous father, and that includes comic relief. However, he was great here - very touching. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta is sent to the prison hospital - she apparently killed a horrible guy. You do not know exactly what happened, but you suppose he was trying to force himself! She has, however, been sentenced to 20 years in prison - her husband is devoted to her and is at her side as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a terrible person. She has the maternal instinct of a hamster - a really, really bad and alcoholic hamster! She is quite funny and deserves to be seen through most of the movie. I loved to drink a bottle of hot water filled with gin and get angry when she learns that she can not make money selling her twins !! Late in the movie, she has a change of heart typical of Hollywood that was supposed to be touching - I found it unnatural. <br /> <br /> A woman gave birth to a stillborn baby. Surprisingly, they put the woman back in the same service as the women who were waiting to give birth !!! A crazy woman, who you think you lost a baby some time ago, is going astray from the psychiatric unit. She insists she is going to have a baby. Later, she escapes again and actually takes one of the children! <br /> <br /> There are many more stories than that, but the ones I mentioned are the main ones. As I said, it's a very entertaining soap opera - and sad enough for many of these stories. The end, in particular, is heartbreaking and exceptionally well done. Some particularly good performances, including Farrell and Aline MacMahon as Chief Nurse. Overall, it's a very good movie - and I do not see why they felt they had to redo the movie a few years later (which was typical of Warner Brothers).
