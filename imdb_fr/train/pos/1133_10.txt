It's a delicious film that's so exaggerated that my wife, my daughter and I found it irresistible. The plot is just crazy but "sounds right" for the world of soap operas in all its scandalous improbabilities and impossibilities. <br /> <br /> I particularly enjoyed the performances of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I do not know anyone better than Kline to play THICKheaded. Desperate need for attention and affirmation of Field's character - and his almost bipolar mood swings - played well in the context of the famous (infamous?) De Field "You love me!" Oscar exclamation. People who can get caught with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think this is the only movie where I did not find myself impatient with the characterization of Whoopi Goldberg; I thought she was "stain" in every note she was hitting. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also first rate. Just a good movie if you're in the mood for a walk and have fun!
