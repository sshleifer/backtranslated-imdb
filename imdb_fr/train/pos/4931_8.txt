When the plague breaks out in New Orleans, Richard Widmark comes to the rescue in "Panic in the Streets", one of the less famous films of the great Elia Kazan. Kazan keeps pace, and there are many wonderful touches - the scene between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays his wife and the scene in the police station shows family life and professional life and the relationships of the average citizens , which is in A striking contrast to life and the relations of the low-lives, portrayed by a threatening Jack Palance, his weak man, the Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has some scenes with actors who seem to kneel in height. <br /> <br /> The acting game is wonderful and the dialogue is lively if the story is not quite up to the direction and performance. It presents some questionable aspects that will be easily detected by the viewer. That aside, it's worth watching. Kazan was a masterful director.
