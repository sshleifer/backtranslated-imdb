In addition to being an extremely entertaining film, let me add that the costumes and landscapes were wonderful. This fun-loving woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy girls who are eager to get their hands on her money. This woman was alone since the death of her husband. He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be demolished. To prevent that, she bought it. Her daughters feared she would throw "their" money and decide to take action. The character actors in this movie were a big plus too. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library, but for the moment, it never came out. Sad.
