.... after 16 years, Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! What happened to the old Burton who had read Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" in order to prepare for Batman's 1988-1989 staging? In appearance, Burton did not research the book or the film because he got it all FALSE! This film is bad! It's not as good as the original and it does not treat the same subject as the original. If you want a good movie about great apes, look at the original. <br /> <br /> ** stars on ****
