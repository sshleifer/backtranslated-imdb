It's absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes me on a roller coaster of emotions. I laugh and cry and am disgusted and happy and in love! All this in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> The actors are all great! I have to mention the lead actor, of course, Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job !! I also admire the actor who plays the role of Tore, who embodies so convincingly this young man with mental abilities. He reminded me of the role of Leonardo di Caprios in Gilbert Grape! And then there is the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone to see and appreciate!
