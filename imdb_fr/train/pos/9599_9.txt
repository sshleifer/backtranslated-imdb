I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there was no dry eye in the house. It's amazing to see not only what Darius is a great man, but how admirable the rest of the team is at such a young age. <br /> <br /> It also made me think how bad MTV was. how to have the opportunity to engage and inspire in a positive way, they refused. This shows you if they really care about youth and their viewers. <br /> <br /> It's a true and touching story that warms the heart ... take your tissues, but it's good to see how caring and inspiring young people today can be.
