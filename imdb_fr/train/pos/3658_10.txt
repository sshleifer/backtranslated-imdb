This film is like an allegory of the gospel. It has such a direct honesty and innocence that you can not believe it was done after the World War, when Italy was ravaged and devastated, and was filled with a huge homeless and impoverished population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of this country of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character from Doestoevisky's "Idiot" style, a modern Christ who finds his way into a big city. He is kindness and purity reinforced by love, and his actions change both the people he meets and the dove that produces miracles. The story is told in a natural way and in a simple style, but imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini's surrealistic fantasies. It's one of the most inspiring and inspiring films ever made.
