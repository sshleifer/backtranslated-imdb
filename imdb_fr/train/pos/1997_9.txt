As a long-time Dickens fan, I've always been disappointed with the adaptations of his novels. <br /> <br /> Even though his works were extremely accurate about human life at every level in Victorian Britain, an ubiquitous line of humor that could be both playful and sarcastic, as dictated the story. In a sense, he was a cartoonist and literary cartoonist. He could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence. He has stung his pride, his morgue, his arrogance, celebrated modesty and empathize for loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but it was a popular writer. <br /> <br /> And it's the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations. At the time of writing this article, Oliver Twist is serialized at the BBC. All misery and cruelty is theirs, but not humor, irony and wild lampery. The result is simply a dark and gloomy experience: the story written by a journalist rather than a novelist. It's not really Dickens at all. <br /> <br /> "Oliver!", In contrast, is much closer to the mark. The mockery of the public service is perfectly interpreted, from dreadful buzz to drunken magistrate. The classic confrontation between the beadle and Mr. Brownlow, in which the law is described as "a donkey, an idiot" could not have been better realized. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But blinding cruelty is also present, insensitive indifference of the state, cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are all presented as surely as the Master would have wished. . <br /> <br /> And then there is the crime. Ron Moody is a treasure as a sordid Jewish barrier, while Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from East London - takes a liberty with Fagin by reinterpreting him as a much more benign type than the original Dicken . In the novel, he was totally ruthless, sending some of his own boys to the gallows to protect himself (though he was also caught and hanged). While in the film, he is portrayed as a kind of whimsical father, a sort of charitable thief rather than a child molester, the latter being a long-standing antisemitic sentiment. Otherwise, very few freedoms are taken with the Dickens original. All the most memorable elements are included. The threat and violence retained are sufficient to ensure narrative fidelity while taking into account the sensitivity of children. Nancy is still beaten to death, Bullseye narrowly escapes drowning and Bill Sykes gets a faithfully graphic result. <br /> <br /> Every song is excellent, although it bows to Schmaltz. Mark Lester mimics his wonderful. His scene and the one I prefer are those in which the world becomes aware of the one who will buy. It's schmaltzy, but it's Dickens right through. <br /> <br /> I could go on. I could congratulate the wonderful scenery, the contrast between rich and poor. There are high quality actors from a larger number of British regulars than you could imagine. <br /> <br /> I should give him 10 points, but I feel more like Scrooge today. Soak up your Christmas dinner. No original was better realized.
