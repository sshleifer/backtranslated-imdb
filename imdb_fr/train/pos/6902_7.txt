It's a modest, character-driven comedy shot in Brazil with a small budget. The premise is familiar, the same as in the 1950s Danny Kaye movie ** On the double **: someone who, jokingly, makes an impression of a famous person is then dredged to imitate the person for true. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two tracks is very effective. Raul Julia, as a German-Paradorian secret policeman, is tall, cool, threatening and Latin. He sports a deliberately obvious blonde dye job. Richard Dreyfus, short film, Jewish New York, is funny and friendly. There are many references and jokes about the show. <br /> <br /> The frame is clearly modeled on Paraguay. Paraguay was indeed ruled from the early 1950s to the late 1980s by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from Germany. The writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions by describing Parador / Paraguay as a typical tyranny of Latin America, with huge disparities of wealth and an active insurgency of guerrilla warfare. In the same vein, Mazursky presents comedian Jonathan Winters as an American retiree who, in reality, is C.I.A. stationmaster at Parador and a personage so powerful that he can boast the country's president. <br /> <br /> In fact, the United States has little influence in Paraguay, which has virtually no social and racial tension elsewhere in the region. This is due to the country's long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The male population has almost been eliminated both times, but the society that emerged from it was patriotic, racist, homogeneous and strongly united. <br /> <br /> At another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of Madonna. Performed by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former club dancer. She is the girl of presidential pleasure at the beginning of the film, but she is seen on television as president at the end. It is now politically and aesthetically correct, no makeup, the hair is out of fashion. removed, carried away by a velvet revolution. <br /> <br /> The only time such an event actually happened in Latin America, the administration of Isabel Peron (in Argentina) (not the beloved Evita, who never exercised her functions) lasted two years after the death of her husband, the legendary ** supremo ** Juan Peron.
