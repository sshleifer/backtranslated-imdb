A comedy that has worked amazingly well is the small British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". This is the first marriage between Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before this little film about the uncontrollable passion of the English moors of the nineteenth century. And although Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suited to ball comedy, everything is going well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who finds herself in the hotel suite of divorce lawyer Logan's divorce lawyer (Olivier) because of an ugly English fog preventing travel. She does everything possible to irritate him - but, in the crazy way of movies, he falls in love with her. And she falls in love with him. But a serious misidentification occurs when Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all she left Oliver) is considered by Olivier as a married woman. To make things even more fun and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) addresses Olivier who wants to divorce his wife and who, according to Larry, must be Oberon! There is a good dialogue about the battle of the sexes and a fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too confident in comedy, but in real Olivier, he is an accomplished professional and he keeps his promises. And he manages the twists, perhaps not with ease, but brilliantly. As an actress, Oberon was not a big jerk, but she was generally quite competent and, despite their reluctance to dislike the screen, she worked well with Olivier. It was filmed at the beginning of Technicolor that looks very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe the print should be cleaned up.
