Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, the Rostov Ripper, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mostly women and children. This shows how much the Soviet bureaucracy hindered the investigation and how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. He does the job so brilliantly that he will not leave anyone indifferent. At first, it may be a little slow, but it takes you as the story unfolds. I can only say that, next to "The Silence of the Lambs", it's by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very difficult to say what actor's performance stands out above the rest in this film. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as an inexperienced medico-legal expert in charge of the investigation. The performance of Donald Sutherland as his cynical superior, and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him, is as remarkable as that of Rea. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, who plays the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character inspired by empathy rather than hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad character, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, his boss, his co-workers ... He is tortured, ashamed and extremely vicious. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this film to all those who are interested in a docu-drama well done, in which the actors are even more important than the special effects. This deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
