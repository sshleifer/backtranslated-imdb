Wow! So funny! Probably a bit too much for normal American kids, and it's really hard to call this kid movie, this movie reminded me of a lot of Time Bandits - very much Terry Gilliam all along. Although the general story is fairly simple, Miike adds many more surreal and inspirational moments to Bunuel. All the first act juxtaposes fiercely from stage to scene the normal family life of the main child / hero, with the spirit world and the ensuing evil. And although the end has a somewhat ambiguous aspect that is common to Miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, especially the anti-war / anti-vengeance message of human madness, are damn poignant. As manic and imaginatively amusing as other great Miike movies, instead of exploring torture and gore, it offers us an infinite amount of monsters and yokai of Japanese folk traditions creatively crafted through computer-generated imagery and puppets in a multi-faceted imaginative adventure. . F'n rad, and one of Miike's best!
