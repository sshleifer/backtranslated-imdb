I had the opportunity to see this film in its early days at the Appalachian Film Festival, in which it won the Best Film Award. This film is brilliantly made, with an excellent distribution that works well as a whole. My favorite performances were Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. In addition, there are very good effects on dragonflies and cockroaches. I was surprised to discover that this film was made on a small budget. Screenwriter-director Adam Jones, who I believe has also won an award for writing, does a great job of directing. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh throughout the movie. A must see.
