Richard Attenborough, who has already given us great films like "A Chorus Line" and "Gandhi", surprises us once again by producing a magnificent hymn to Nature. In fact, the vast territory of Canada, still unexplored at the time, helps to compose the stunning beauty of the landscapes captured by the camera. If the film is really based on a true story, once again, it becomes clear that "men of vision" are actually men who live beyond their time, with a historical perspective that only Time will give them the reason. The cinematography is magnificent, as in the casting directed by Pierce Brosnan, whose performance is due to the hands of the master of Attenborough. Annie Galipeau plays the role of Archie's beloved. Film that must be in a list of those who really love nature ...
