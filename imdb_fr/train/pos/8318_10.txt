An excellent movie. Superb actor Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role as Satin. This film was one of the last "all black" films of the 1970s and, unlike the "blaxploitation" films of that time, this film was actually intriguing and very well done. The soundtrack of the film, sung by Aretha Franklin, was very popular in the R & B charts of the time.
