George and Kim travel with their young son, Miles, to a secluded cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a stag and pours into a ditch. But what seems like a simple misfortune marks the beginning a terrifying journey becomes a reality and a flesh-eating spirit, Wendigo, half-animal and half-man, haunts a small town ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is a horror film that makes you think. He is often fond of a dark family drama. The acting is awesome, the characters are well developed and there are moments that chill the bones. The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are managed efficiently and you never know what is real. and what is imagined, or even if the story unfolds entirely in Miles' head. "Wendigo" is my first contact with the work of Larry Fessenden and will surely not be the last. Give this movie a chance, if you do not mind looking at something unconventional. 8 out of 10
