I have always wanted to watch Hong Kong movies, but not all of them have met my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor of most HK movies, nor does it contain a second-rate plot that has been drawn into the movie. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that fill a "smart" space (the only really intelligent martial arts film I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but as Hollywood is involved, this is is not a real Hong Kong movie.) There are incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first (which is one of the coolest I have ever seen, but so short) to the last major scenes! But beware, there is also a lot of blood flowing (people cut in half, decapitated, etc.). The production is quite good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be realized even if some plans must be quite technical (note: the sheet of paper he throws and got stuck against a wall!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite movie in Hong Kong, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure we can find out more about this director! Ace.
