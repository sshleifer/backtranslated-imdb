I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The DVD transfer dates from last year 2001. This film of 1988 is really a very good little film. Neglected by most people. I saw him at the theater in 1988 and had loved him ever since. I like the opening photo of Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as commented by another user). Pittsburgh looks like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say that Pitts' garbage truck tour with Nicky is very quaint and interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone has said, gives a remarkable and wonderful performance. The DVD is a good transfer, without extras, but in widescreen format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
