I found this movie available in streaming on Netflix and I thought I might try it. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who finally saw each other after their father passed away. Ryan and Theo argue first about who did what. But later, Theo discovers that his brother Ryan is not only gay but is dying of an incurable disease. Ryan and Theo spend their time correcting their differences. <br /> <br /> It's such an incredible movie. I only saw Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24, but he was phenomenal in this regard. David Cubitt, an actor I've NEVER heard before, has also done a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those interested in the gay and lesbian genre. It's a film not to be missed. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10 out of 10 stars. Excellent film!
