Personally, I love this film and this novel (I first read the book and decided to see the film). First of all, the plot is really original and unique. The acting is also great and I like the actors. Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) adapts perfectly to his role and really sells it to you. There are also some tacky lines thrown in (Idk if they were supposed to be corny), but they will really brighten the mood and provide a good laugh. The atmosphere of Maine is really a perfect place to shoot this movie and it attracts you throughout the movie. Not only will you like it but you will want to see it again and again, I recommend it to 100% to all horror fans !!
