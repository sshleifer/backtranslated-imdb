There has been a series of recent surf movies that I seem to run randomly without warning. I caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a nice surprise! The focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing, from the 60s Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks through Jaws. Damn, I could watch a movie about Laird Hamilton - one of the greatest athletes of this generation - so the rest is sauce. There is a lot of great surf mixed with interviews of surf stars, past and present, in a pleasant, casual and unpretentious way. Of all the surf movies I've seen, it best tells the story of the big wave, and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
