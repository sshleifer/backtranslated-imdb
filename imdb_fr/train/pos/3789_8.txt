Congratulations to the Czechs, their once powerful film industry seems to wake up from post-communist sleep. <br /> <br /> The Loners is a comedy composed of all the elements you would expect to see in a modern "Hollywood" production. the trash that seems to have been attached to the genre in recent years. A superb soundtrack, excellent visual editing, a beautiful Prague cityscape, to name but a few. <br /> <br /> The story is actually composed of several sub-stories that often intersect and overlap, and is essentially a collage of destinies, destinies, desires ... It follows a group of young townspeople under the age of 30 through a variety of situations ranging from everyday life to hobbies, careers and obsessions. And it's hillarious. In fact, there is a moment in the film where all the theater in which I was (about 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed all the time for about 40 to 50 seconds. How often do you live this with modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although the main cast as a whole is excellent (especially the future Macedonian star Labina Mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing too familiar difficulties) I must quote Jiri Machacek for his performance incredibly believable Jakub, a gypsy who is constantly stoned, whose brain is severely touched by the stuffs he smokes and who crush him in a plethora of fun situations. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not miss it! There is a lot to offer.
