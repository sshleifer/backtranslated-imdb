It must be one of the best movies about serial killers I've ever seen, and it comes from someone who absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs. HBO has won the jackpot here. This film is convincing from the first to the last moment. <br /> <br /> This film has so many underlying themes that it's hard to say exactly what it's all about. It tells the research, which lasts for a decade, the Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as an inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of the investigation, while Donald Sutherland gives an even more engaging performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him . Their two performances are subtle masterpieces --- Rea begins naive and does not want to compromise, while Sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation. Towards the end, Rea becomes more tired of the world and beaten by the system, while Sutherland becomes more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other movie, I would have said that Sutherland's performance stands out from the others. but here it is rivaled by Jeffrey DuMann, the serial killer himself. DuMann creates brilliantly here a character who inspires the empathy rather than the hatred that we think to find. He is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we have the impression that he is also disgusted with what he does. as we are. He is tortured, ashamed, but vicious too. <br /> <br /> If you can take the incredibly dark subject (and that * is * very * disturbing), then you should see this movie.
