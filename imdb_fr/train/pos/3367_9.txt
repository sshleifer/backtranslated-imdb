This film has great acting, great photography and a very strong story that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit in, whether you accept to play a role or how to free yourself from There are already some great comments on these aspects. I want to comment on the official framework of the film. Basically, it's two people on a roof. There is a unity of place and time, with 2 protagonists and radio acting choir. Many filmmakers have turned Greek tragedies into films, many filmmakers have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no filmmaker, in my opinion, has succeeded as admirably as Etore Scola to address the purity and strength of the great Greek tragedies. in history and the formal setting. A masterpiece.
