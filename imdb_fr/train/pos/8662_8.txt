I liked that a lot. In fact, if I see him again (and I plan to do it), I will perhaps love him. I will echo other critics by saying that this film really grows when you watch. It starts a little slowly, but the path is very natural and has a certain mood. You have just entered the movie. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summer atmosphere of the movie and I found the film very touching as a whole. The characters have a strong element of realism and the film weaves slowly and gently a spell as you get involved in the various interactions that unite them and want to know how it will unfold and what paths the characters will choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this subject. There are obscure movies that have more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I'm going to do is say I missed the end that drives me crazy and I have to watch it again to see that. It's a movie that may not be for everyone, but I think I'm very underestimated (even some of my purest friend moviegoers who have seen almost every film he has not not seen before) This is largely a message board, but I like it a lot, and anyone who likes warm family drama about the landscape, the atmosphere and a slow, languid rhythm should probably throw it a glance. It is particularly interesting to note that this is happening in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who love the South and the movies that take place there, it's a gem. I will add my vote to the very lamentable comments and recommend this little-known film.
