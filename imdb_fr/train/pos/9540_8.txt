Most of the comments I heard about Meatball Machine were quite mixed. A couple even say they think "it sucks". Well, to those I say, get into f @ ckin's imagination and go yourself f @ ck. It was a very entertaining film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bug that attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these murderous robots named Necroborgs. Finally, you learn that these mechanical insects also fix you a small parasite, which is then able to control your actions due to the hot wiring of your nervous system. Unfortunately for two solitary young adults in search of love, they encounter the virus of mechanics and even before you know that transformations are happening and blood is splashing. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat? Why are the Necroborgs fighting? Can the two desperate singles express their feelings for each other and do the bad guy? Only one way to find out. <br /> <br /> Enter Meatball Machine I was a little suspicious because of the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. Some unanswered questions, some average interventions at times and a slightly confusing end are the only weak points I can think of. Whether in the anime or the parasites that become small characters, and even in the impression of limited budget, this film strikes much better than it is missing. With a story in development, interesting enough for you to ask yourself questions, mixed with the effects of makeup and splash of blood, it's a bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / movie fan that splatter fans should try. 8 out of 10
