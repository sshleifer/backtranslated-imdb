Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's films, brings the joy of telling stories to the public. It's the kind of film that makes you feel like a kid again; it's just magic. It's a crime that took so long for the film to be released in the US, but now that it's here, check it out! And stick to the original language; the dubbing has somewhat changed my impressions of the characters, which must be avoided at all costs in the translation of a film (or a book, whatever.) <br /> <br /> I give it a ten / ten.
