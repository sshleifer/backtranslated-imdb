Clara Lago is wonderful as the main character of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish-American girl who moves to Spain with her mother at the time of the Spanish Civil War. It turns out that the mother goes home to die and stays with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences in a short time Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is first of all a nuisance for her then they become close. The film is beautifully shot, bathed mainly in soft colors. Carol yearns for her father, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel Sher's love for him. While the war itself is a little behind in this film, it envelops the life of the character. I think you will like it. See it especially for Clara Lago, who does a great job as Carol. She is really to watch.
