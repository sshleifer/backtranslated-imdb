Of the three remakes of this plot, I love them all, I have them all three on VHS and in addition I have a copy of it on DVD. There are just enough variations in the scripts to make the three entertaining and re-observable. In addition, has another movie been redone three times with such stars? Of course, the main stars are excellent, but the supporting actors are also superb. I particularly like William Tracy like Pepi. He was such a thief of stage that I looked for other films in which he is. He has appeared in many movies, but most are not available. Like other reviews, I also say - buy this one.
