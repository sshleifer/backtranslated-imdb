It was a documentary not to be missed for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely going to watch the rehearsal. I really sympathize with the main character of the film because, yes, I have a less serious skin problem, epidermolysis bullosa dystrophic (EB). This is a sad, sometimes funny and very emotional documentary about a boy suffering from a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a kid (because of muscle wasting) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most moments of sympathy see his terrible condition and tear off his bandages. Jonny had a rather ugly sense of humor, he even recounted beyond the grave by showing his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his famous big brother and model, and Jonny's supporter, Nell McAndrew. He won BAFTA for best editing and best new director (factual) and was nominated for Best Sound (factual) and Flaherty Documentary Award. He was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. A documentary to see absolutely!
