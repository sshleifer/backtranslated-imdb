Obviously, the budget allocated to this film was not huge, which certainly affected the production. But the story and the end were so brutal that they made up for a lot. I mean brutal at the level of Ju Dou and other (big) Chinese movies. I saw this for the first time at the age of 14. I ran home and I prayed God to forgive me for everything ...
