I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of the film form, his film has sometimes been neglected in my opinion. But this film is one of my favorites because it really gives you the impression of the time in which the film was shot. \ <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the fashion, the they talked, OK, they could be exaggerated, but it's good to know that it happened that two men try to outdo themselves with delusional acrobatics. <br /> <br /> I just felt it was a part of the story that should be appreciated by many people and appreciated for that reason. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I only saw it on TV. But for all those who wish to watch a slice of film on this period, it is the ideal film.
