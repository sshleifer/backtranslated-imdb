Soap Opera on a married woman from a small town (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as a star in her local theater but dreams of becoming a Broadway star. When a famous actor who is a ham, a wind bag and a womanizer arrives in town, she visits him in his room with the dream of giving him tips to become a star. she has everything you need but "experience" to become a big star. Her husband discovers and punishes the guy who caused the unexpected death of the actor - resulting in a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life sentence for her husband. The next thing you know is that she joined a traveling Burlesque show hoping to get to Broadway one day and make enough money to get her man's freedom - while her baby sleeps in a trunk! <br /> <br /> This movie has a rather interesting plot, well, a little exaggerated perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you have it) - all * greatly * reinforced by the strong and emotional performance given by Kay Francis makes this film. The well-made actress Minna Gombell in her role as "woman almost forty years old" who works the burlesque and befriends Kay is also useful. To see, especially for fans of Kay Francis.
