Sergeant Ryker is accused of being a traitor during the Korean War, a pending offense. A long-lasting marshal ensues during which Sgt. must stay in a military prison. After numerous investigations, the defense attorney tries to exonerate the sentenced non-convicted with an eleventh-hour ploy. Very good image.
