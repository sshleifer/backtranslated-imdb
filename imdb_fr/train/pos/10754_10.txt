I was a little skeptical if I had to watch this when it first aired on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in New York that day, going to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the devastation and carnage again, but as many I was curious to see what it was all about. Tears came to my eyes as I watched this documentary. All my memories came back and the intense images were incredible. I bought the DVD at the one-year anniversary and watched it several times. How these guys were able to capture these pictures was amazing. If you have not seen this documentary, do yourself a favor and check it out. It is obviously depressing and will make people cry, but it is an incredible document of the darkest hour of this country.
