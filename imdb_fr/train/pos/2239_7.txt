I guess this film will only work on people who have all been upset by the giant hype of Lord of the Rings. Well, I was. And so I really like this movie. In particular, I like that all these flawless superheroes of the SdR are parodied to perfection and disrespectful. The most brilliant is Gandalf's counterpart (the brave wizard, wise and completely devoid of any sense of humor): Almghandi, the cowardly travesty and cerebral death. The counterpart of Sauron ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) just carries a bucket with eye holes as a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is another accident-prone fool trying to repair his broken sword ("Ulrike" the legend) with scotch tape. And "Strunzdumm" (the counterpart of Wormtong) has indeed a strong resemblance with Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh
