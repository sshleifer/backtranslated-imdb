Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the fourth film in the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older, but he still has it. Harry had been ordered to go on vacation after problems caused by a theft (hence the memorable slogan "Make My Day"!). But the city where he took his vacation was worse A woman became vigilant after a rape attack in a carnival and starts having punks one by one. The last movie to see Sandra Locke in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after The Enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious. The Clint Eastwood sunglasses were Gargoyles, best known for the sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. Worth a look if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or crime thrillers.
