BASEketball is an extremely funny film that features a film that usually makes the movie a lot more funny, humorous content more than fun in your pants, and a very good scenario, even if it's the classic slackers and the only thing I did not like about BASEketball, it's that this kid was not really necessary in the movie, but, if the kid was not in the movie, some fun scenes would not have existed. exclude them all because all critics did not like this movie. BASEKEBALL is an excellent comedy that gives everyone what they want.
