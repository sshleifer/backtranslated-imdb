In Micro Phonies, the stooges are the best. In this short film, the trio is made up of handymen working in a recording studio. Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) sings the voice of spring. The voice is incredible. Curly in drags is heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three friends end up going to the party where Curly will disguise herself as a drag. They play a record of the spring voices and all goes well until Moe destroys the disc on Curly's head. They end up using the sexlet lucia until the baritone recognizes them and disconnects them. Alice Van Doren grabs the boy screaming and hides behind a curtain to help them. All is well until the baritone wonders how Curly sings without the help of a phonograph and discovers Alice behind the curtain. The three accomplices turn out to be scammers, but Alice's father discovers the talent of his daughter and agrees to become a singer. The minions are thrown out of the room. Excellent.
