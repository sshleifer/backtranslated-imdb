There are many films about the Second World War, but Mother Night is quite distinctive: in this film, we present Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept the role of spy: more specifically, a CIA agent, Major Wirtanen (Goodman), recruits Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the highest circles of the Hitler regime. However, the agreement states that the US government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for reasons of national security. Campbell becomes a hated character in the United States. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past comes back to him and haunts him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can not cope with the avalanche of events that hit poor Campbell ... <br /> <br /> The story is deeply touching, as we watch the tragedy of Campbell. great patriot, is treated with disdain by all who surround him. Not only that, but he realizes gradually that even the people who are closest to him have many secrets. Vonnegut creates a moving atmosphere, Campbell's desperation deepening and almost stifling the viewer. <br /> <br /> Nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in "Affliction", although he plays tragic characters for self-destruction in both roles. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said of all the actors. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, so I can not understand how the film compares to this one. Anyway, it does not matter here: my criticism is about the film as such, and the film deserves with all its heart a 9/10.
