I saw that in Detroit in what was to be his original race. I literally slipped into the theater alley. It was so funny. I have not seen it since, but I would love it. Where do you get a copy? Anyone who says anything about whether it's dated or excessive is, for my money, just a bunch of installers. Each skit is either nasty, erotically or perversely hilarious. Each! There is not a weak included. The opening sequence, for example, which parodies 2001, presents go-go-dancer gorillas with pendulous breasts. Felinni would have filmed him if he had this bad spirit ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and a sneering heart, you put it perfectly in your best list.
