Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civilian lawyer who handles a criminal case in "The Unknown Man", a 1951 film starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great advocate of justice, Pidgeon accepts a volunteer case to defend a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle), charged with murder, and has him acquitted. Shortly after, he realizes that the man is guilty and extorted protective money for his victim as well as other merchants in the neighborhood. The prosecutor (Sullivan) informs him that Rudi is a small change, that to eliminate organized crime, it is necessary to find the best man. Mason finds the best man and is facing a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small film in black and white that manages to retain the interest of the viewer with its various twists, although it is a little artificial. This is really the story of a good man seeking his god, justice and what he is willing to do to reach it. And it's the most artificial part of all. I suppose there was a time before O.J., Menendez Brothers, etc., etc., where people believed in the justice and integrity of lawyers. Anyway, this viewer spent the time. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his beautiful and elegant attitude and his declamatory voice show us a confident man, but also deeply caring. Pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years, but never really achieved superstar status. He was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did it. It may be because by the time he had tracks, he was already in his thirties and was missing an idol in the morning; or it may be that he lacks only something particular; or that he was typed as the second leader of a big star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives here an honest and touching performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie with good performances.
