Clever, nervous, witty, fast, sexy, extravagant, sleazy, erotic, sincere and cheesy, Footlight Parade is a first rate entertainment, one of the movies. <br /> <br /> Realism, satirical treatment gives a new breath to the material and its rhythm and delivery of the line are breathtaking. Say they only started talking pictures 7 years ago! The brilliance of dialogue can not be equaled today, especially if we consider that "realism" has invaded contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was shot at a time when Hayes' restriction code was ignored and the result is a cool, self-referential, critical and lively cinema, directly addressing a contemporary public suffering from depression and general anxiety. I would recommend watching any film from this period, 1930-1935, to get an idea of ​​what popular cinema might be.
