I can not decide if this is one of my favorite movies. It's a good thriller with an emotional core but I still can not decide. I really liked that. This is Terry Gilliam's first film I saw. My first impression? I was engaged to the end and it is not so complex (to be confused). <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the future. A man, James Cole (Bruce Willis), is sent from the future to get information on the past (1996 to be precise). A virus killed 5 billion people. He is sent by the future to obtain information on this subject. Kathryn Railly is a psychiatrist. The love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the yearning for that love and the desire for a normal life. The details are very interestingly linked at the end. <br /> <br /> What I liked in this film is that unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film did not prefer to give a boring social life. comment and instead focused on this guy and his desire for a regular life. "You want to see the ocean, to be with her" is particularly poignant in this film. He chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. So it's not really a post-apocalyptic film, but rather a romantic science-fiction film whose themes range from time travel to scrambled realities, and so on. That's what makes this movie a special movie from the 90s. The intricate plot runs smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty good. Bruce willis surprised me here because he did not act like a tough guy, but he played well in front of a confused and in love man. His desperation in some sequences is beautifully described. I have to watch his other films. The magnificent Madeleine Stowe is a treat to watch. Since I saw this movie, I became so obsessed with it. She gave a beautiful representation of a woman who sympathizes with her patient and who ends up falling in love with him. Brad Pitt is however the real surprise with his portrait of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar-nominated performance is quite surprising given that he does not have many critics who have nice words for him. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty scary and that's another reason to watch the movie. Length or complexity is not a problem as important as this movie is very fast and there are enough incidents to interest people. And every incident of this film makes sense and nothing is useless. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
