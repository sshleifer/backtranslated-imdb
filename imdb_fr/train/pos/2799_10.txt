As an anti-football footballer, I reluctantly took my younger brother to see this movie, though secretly I was hoping it would be East is East II. The trailers looked funny, so I thought I'd try it. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but after that I was stuck on the screen, and it had nothing to do with the cervical cramp. caused by sitting too close to the front because of a packed auditorium. The acting was cool and dynamic, the characters endearing and the jokes really fun. The entire auditorium burst out laughing every minute. Fans of football or not, the sport has no connection with the fundamental principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a touch of Sikh culture and you have the formula of the best British comedy I've seen for a long time, if I may say so ... better than East, it's East. <br /> <br /> This film trots well at a pleasant pace, never staying longer than necessary or leaving nothing unfinished, entertaining and mentally engaging the viewer. Although it is not a typical film, there are some pleasant surprises and things do not always go according to plan. <br /> <br /> In saying this, there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as a script filler. I suppose that depending on your particular fondness for happy ends, you might be thrilled / let down by the end. Personally, if there was another result, I would have written a very strong letter to the writers. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I must say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) has achieved the best performance. I never knew that people like that existed but its realism with sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me to know it! The price of the least convincing character (main characters) will unfortunately go to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but do not get me wrong, even if she's done a great performance, it's just that someone has to be the last of the best and sorry Kiera, this time it's you. <br /> <br /> Tip: Do not leave before the credits. Once the lights came back, I realized with horror that I might not have had to watch this movie after all. Ice Junkie, my beloved but forgotten, had melted into a sweet blue juice. Oh, what am I saying, it was absolutely great and I can not recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I am a student. I splash only if it's really worth it.
