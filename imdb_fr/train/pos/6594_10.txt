The types of tweedy teachers thought they understood everything. The peoples of today who live in Polynesia are from migratory Asians, moving fearlessly from the Far East, from island to island, then heading to Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific for centuries. thousands of years. But the established thought simply did not satisfy the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation were true, how come people born and raised in these islands have traditions, illustrations and physical characteristics that do not resemble those of Asia, but of South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look as much as one could find on the island thousands of miles away? Is it just a coincidence that the Islanders designate the sea for South America and say that their ancestors came from there, headed by Tiki, their equivalent of Adam? Meanwhile, how do the Norwegians speak of Scandinavian precursors chased from the South American continent they colonized and who, along with some of the indigenous peoples with whom they loved each other, headed for the west coast? It's too much for a coincidence for Heyerdahl. With an incredible amount of moxie, a handful of crew members and local know-how in traditional raft construction, an expedition begins. It is as much a journey in the human imagination as a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with the bases of the tools and the marine sense. The Oscar-winning documentary may be dated in its tone and Anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it is flying in a spirit of adventure beyond even the space program launched ten years later, while men are willing to risk everything for test a theory they think. is right. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an amazing turner page and the perfect setup for the news style movie.
