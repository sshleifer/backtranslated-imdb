I saw this movie when I was a kid and it broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished end ... I grew up in many great animated movies and it was one of my favorites, because it was so unusual - a story of injustice , cruelty, loneliness, life and choice can not be undone and the need of others. Chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf is alone too when Chirin follows him into the mountain. The wolf does not kill the lamb, though every night he says "maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." The band I have is broken and degraded by age and use. I'll fix it and watch the movie again someday and cry as hard as I did when I was a child. Stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and complexity of meaning, are very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never met catharsis so beautiful. I am happy to have seen this film and I am happy to have seen it child.
