A great movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and horrible, perfectly SURREAL (a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I would compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) maybe mixed with a bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insects!). Also a bit of Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... <br /> <br /> Add some Night on Earth, Angel Heart and a bit of Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Ladder from Jacob, The Forbidden and Salome de Barker - which should together form at least the concept of a black night ... NIGHT BLACK. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of avant-garde and / or surrealist cinema (like me) you will love this one. If you're waiting for something more than an action-packed movie with a mean plot, try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> Last words: the plot is very very strange and unusual and it's probably the # One reason why most people who do not like this movie hate it.
