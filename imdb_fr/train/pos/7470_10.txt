I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge !! .. Tom Cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say ... I was totally blown away by the movie and especially by TC's performance, I thought it was a very moving film and that it was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews and decided not to go see him, I'm so glad I was. "The strange thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I found it totally catchy and that I could not stop thinking about it the next day. As far as this film is concerned, all I can say is that it's NOT THAT (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) it's about the people and events that shape their lives and how small events, like getting in a car, can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> As far as critics have written, yes, the original was perhaps a second breathtaking film for Alejandro Amen√°bar , but it was a totally different interpretation of the subject, and in no way a narcissistic remake for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not even think of writing a few banal and light sentences to describe the movie, go see it !!!! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's not a balancing review What's that? It's not that kind of movie.
