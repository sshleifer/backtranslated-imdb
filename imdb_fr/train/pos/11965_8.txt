Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews in recent days, I entered the theater prepared for a mediocre outing of Woody. Fortunately, I could not be more wrong. While the artist Woody slows down a bit, author / director Woody is in great shape and has found a credible way to integrate his 70-year-old character into the story. Judging by the laughter and gaffes, the audience ate Allen's one-liners and dialogued in a way that I had not seen in years. <br /> <br /> In a cinematic landscape dominated by software-supported history arcs, tastes for 20 years and a chain formula for kids, it's a source of satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen continue his very personal and always enriching. path.
