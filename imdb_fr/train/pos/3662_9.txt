It's a really strange movie - and it's NOT a bad thing. It's a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless AND a fairy tale. I'm sure some may find this film a bit too strange, but I loved it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of ordinary people (no actors) and gets a great performance type together. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point of view - this one does it in a very absurd way. Ignore the nerdy special effects - after all, this was done in the early 50s and the special effects are not very important anyway (or at least they should not feature in the movies). Instead, sit back and enjoy the very strange and stupid ride. If you are a total curmudgeon, you will have fun. <br /> <br /> By the way, since the first review of this movie, I saw another film directed by DeSica, to see absolutely. CHILDREN WATCH US Although it is not a fantasy or a light spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, a great film nonetheless.
