Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I have seen it at least a hundred times and I can not get through without crying. I challenge anyone to watch Celie and Nettie's reunion, or Shug's and father's reunion, and not feel your eyes become fogged. Whoopie Goldberg should receive one for his breathtaking performance. And for the person who said you can not like the movie if you liked the book, it's wrong! I am a testament to that.
