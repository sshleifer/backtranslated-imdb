I want to add to the praise for the production of this film, especially the luminous cinematography. A glow of fire on a smooth and muscular skin creates images of striking beauty. The film was nominated for (and won) only one Oscar - the first one awarded to the montage. Mala's performance is morose, penetrating and powerful.
