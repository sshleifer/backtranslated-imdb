Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had very contradictory policies in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented the hypocrisies and folly of America and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, "Merrill's Marauders" described the war as a hell needed and "Pickup on South Street" talks about the dangers of communist spies. All his films are very entertaining and, although he has often been cataloged as a filmmaker, Fuller was just as good as the big studio studios. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite obsolete themes, the film style is remarkably ahead of its time. It's also a very fast, tight and sometimes brutal dark film. <br /> <br /> The acting is fantastic. Richard Widmark is an excellent anti-hero and Jean Peters is very sexy as a girl working for his communist spy boyfriend. The thief of show is Thlema Ritter, however, in an absolutely delightful performance as a policeman. The angles used by Fuller are excellent, which makes the sequences of actors all the more exciting and brutal (it is very violent for its time). The camera moves continuously as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a thrilling black thriller with action. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller movie, but it's a very close second. (8/10)
