When I saw this show for the first time, I thought it looked interesting. I looked at it, I saw how it went around Sarah, as if the character saw the world ... turn around her. I understood it, but I did not laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> On stage and in her show, she is racist, brutal, insensitive and extremely egocentric. I did not get it at first and I took everything literally. Then I saw his movie Jesus is magic. I think that was the basis for Sarah Silverman for me, explaining to me what "language" she speaks. She's like Marilyn Manson, who works so hard to give us a face of horrible ideas and images, but you finally realize it's not an assault, but a statement. And once you understand that, you're happy to see someone finally giving it to you. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that only intelligent people will understand, or that hating this show is proof of your idiocy. Although I like a lot of "smart" shows, I still do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I feel that it is good, but I do not understand. Many people will never have access to the Sarah Silverman program, but I am happy to have come. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work hard, each episode is loaded not dialogues and songs, or sequences of dreams, production numbers. These people do not set up something to occupy a time slot and will appeal to advertisers. They seem to have the mission to make the best show possible. If I had to predict the future of this show, I would say it will go in the direction of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before the time and will remain in the hearts of fans and on DVD. But take courage, creators of SSP, your audience IS there and we will monitor it as long as they let you do the show.
