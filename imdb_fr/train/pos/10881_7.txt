"Cut" is a parody of the genre slasher, predominantly total, which gives the expected results. Most standard slasher shots are there; the scary old house, the woods, the indestructible anonymous serial killer, buckets of blood, and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they have sex (this is hardly a spoiler). <br /> <br /> -up is simplicity itself: the film school nerds undertake to complete a "masterpiece" of unfinished slasher, unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast. It also allows - ok, messy - to have Kylie Minogue in the first roll. They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film, starring Molly Ringwald, who steals the film because she gets the best replicas. The rest of the cast is perfect, especially the charming Jessica Napier, who plays it directly while chaos and violence are unleashed around her. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of red herrings and false suspense, and there's very little time to figure out who the killer is, because the movie is moving at such a fast pace. It also has a proper low budget appearance, including an awkward edition that is probably deliberate. Good soundtrack too. If there is a problem with this film, it is to decide if it is a show or a tribute to the genre slasher. Probably a bit of both.
