Rosenstrasse is more of an intimate film than an epic film, which could have driven away many moviegoers in search of a plot similar to that of the pianist. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good writer, opts for a feminist peep at a time too illustrated by its colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and the point of view of the ordinary Aryan German rather than a point Jewish perspective. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unknown burdens of people trapped in historical circumstances of which they are victims. The rhythm of the film is introspective, poignantly slow, meditative. In addition, the characters are so alive that transitions between generations and the passage of time have been skilfully crafted. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece and some narrative flaws are well received. Another defect lies in a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama experienced by the characters. Nevertheless, this film is worth the detour. Finally, the Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend of German films dealing with ghosts of a nightmarish past, a trend that includes excellent films like Nowhere in Africa and recently the controversial Downfall. I would recommend this film to those who can read beyond the images.
