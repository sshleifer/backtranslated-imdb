It's a beautiful movie. The real story of bond between father and son. It's by far, Tom Hanks at its best. Tom Hanks is really out of this world. He usually has the roles of nice guy. However, in this film, he appears in this film as a little grainy, but it always emerges as a rose, until the very last scene, the assassination of his character. The cast of this film was well set up. I also like the party when there is total silence when Tom Hanks's character shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is no sound in this scene, but simply emotion. I like the look on John Rooney, the face of Paul Newman's character when he realizes, even before seeing it, that it is the character of Tom Hanks who takes revenge and that he knows that his fate has arrived. The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away and I knew I had to go get the video. Since then, I have added it to my collection of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
