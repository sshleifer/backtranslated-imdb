Religious bigotry is omnipresent. Australia is not immune. <br /> <br /> A dingo grabbed a baby and the mother was tried and sentenced to prison for "killing" her own baby. I do not want to spoil the story for you, but you must know the basics before you kneel in the causes that brought this woman to a jail. <br /> <br /> Buy or rent the film and discover how deep-seated human hatred for those who are different continues to flourish around the world. <br /> <br /> It's a very moving film with a great cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Both Meryl Streep (with his famous Australian accent) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are remarkable. Those who have support roles are also very good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> See!
