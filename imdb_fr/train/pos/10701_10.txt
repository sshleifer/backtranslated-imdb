Critics did not like this movie. He bombed the United States and, as a result, received only a limited show in Britain. Which was a shame because it represents British humor rather than American and should have been presented first in Britain. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks great and a Russian very convincing. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate" and "Birthday Girl" contains at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer of this classic 1960s (although it is a totally different story!). <br /> <br /> Of course this often changes from comedy to black comedy thriller adventure - but it's memorable, moving and a breath of fresh air compared to blockbuster mega-budget means. <br /> <br /> See it with an open mind!
