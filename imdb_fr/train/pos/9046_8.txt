I saw Jake Gyllenhaal for the first time in Jarhead (2005) some time ago, and since then I have been watching each of his films coming to my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even looks a little like Owen) that protrudes from the screen. I am sure that if he wins fleshy roles, he will win an Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> This is not to denigrate this film. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful story, with very credible people (well, it's based on the author's first shenanigans with rocket), a superb cast ?? Chris Cooper is still good and Laura Dern is still on my watchlist ?? with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, enthusiasm ... and the great soundtrack with so many old rock'n rolls to get stomped on. <br /> <br /> But this film had a special meaning for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the stars of the night to see Sputnik sneak into the darkness; like Homer too, I experimented rocket in my garden and used exactly the same chemicals as fuel; and like Homer, most of my attempts have also resulted in an explosive disaster! What a pleasure it was ... <br /> <br /> But I did not reach its great heights (metaphorical and physical). But that's what you discover by watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a basic family film, but it's an endangered race, it seems. Take the time to see him, with the children: you will all laugh well.
