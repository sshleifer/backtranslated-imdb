Yes, it gives the ten stars. It is obvious that this filling is a genius. The universe one day sent to Trent Harris a young and wonderfully strange man and Harris filmed him with a cassette, in all that real unsuitable glory that you simply can not simulate. Too bad it ends in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternative ending could be written for the story of this guy. The other two stages of the trilogy take up history, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the respective roles of the young men. The world is expanded and the strangeness is contextualized by the narrative, which gives us a broader insight into the strange growth in vanilla America. Recommended for everyone!
