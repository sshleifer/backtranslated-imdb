I grew up watching this movie and I still love it as much today as when I was a child. Do not listen to critics. They are not accurate about this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines in his role. You can sit with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone to see. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy.With demons, dragons and a little bald kid with powers similar to that of God.This film takes you from LA to Tibet, from the breathtaking views of the wonderful temples of the mountains in Tibet.Just a beautiful view! So, go treat yourself and take this one! You will not regret it!
