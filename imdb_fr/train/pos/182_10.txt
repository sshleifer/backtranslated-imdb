If you are not introduced to the Gundam world, this is a good place to start. If you are exhausted by Star Wars or Star Wars, here is a realistic and convincing science fiction series in which you can immerse yourself. It's not the simplistic story of the robot that saves a world saved by a boy you've been waiting for, but rather a complex and emotionally captivating space war drama, where the dividing line between "good" and the "bad guys" is clearly less clear. <br /> <br /> Gundam 0080 tells the story of Al Izuruha, a naive young boy living in a neutral space colony. He spends his days dreaming of Mobile Suits and making war on his friends. In this series, Al befriends an enemy soldier, Bernie Wiseman. In the end, little Al learns hard lessons about the reality of the war, as well as about the suffering and sacrifices needed. <br /> <br /> I loved this series of OAV, with its cool mecha creations, its history and its friendly characters. I recommend this series to anyone who loves realistic SF cartoons, or to those who think cartoons are just stupid or sexy entertainment.
