When I saw the exterminators of the year 3000 for the first time, I had no expectation for this film. Although it was not so bad that I thought. It's a bit like the Italian version of Roadwarrior, with its cast, almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, responsible for the history of zombie flesh eaters, are also behind the story. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantini plays Tommy, and you can see this kid at Paura nella as the role of Mary's brother. Quite entertaining film, with some dull parts.
