Love Trap is an independent film "to see". When I sat down to watch the movie, I arrived with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, substantive and creative. The writer takes you further and further in each scene, allowing you to relate to the realistic characters with whom everyone can relate. The film allowed me to reflect on my life and what I consider to be love. The film shows what love really is, action is not emotion. I was also impressed by the quality of the film and soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give two big congratulations to the film and recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
