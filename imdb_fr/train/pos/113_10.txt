I have not seen this movie for about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When I'm asked about my favorite movies, it's the one I always mention first. There are some movies (works of art like this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place in you, a place so protected, hidden and yet so sensitive, that they do everything a life on the spectator, a life-changing event, like the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This film "shook me" when I first saw it. It left me an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
