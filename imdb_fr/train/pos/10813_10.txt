I turned it on to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I now read. I'll admit that my jaw dropped when the references to pork chops and watermelon began to arrive, but people can not see this film as a stereotypical or racist piece. It's about a short film made by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was very segregated and where the stereotypes conveyed by the people involved were the jokes of their time, the old exaggerated tendencies for humor. We see modern black movies doing the same thing, but with new trends (stereotypes), "ho's" and "the hood", etc. I think if you look back in eighty years, you'll find that today's movies will look just as racist. What the viewer should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and Sammy Davis Jr., as big as a pint, who plays with his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and is remarkably identical to the face that adulthood. Everyone involved in this film has had a lot of fun doing it. Why not enjoy it for what it is, instead of what it should have been?
