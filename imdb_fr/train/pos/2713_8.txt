Wilson (Erica Gavin) is caught by the cops and sent to jail for this slippery and fun example of exploitation by 70, which marks the debut of Jonathan Demme in the staging. After writing and producing some of Roger Cormans' new world mentor films, Demme was able to make his first film, and he delivers a film that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence but has an attraction the quality of the tongue in the cheek too; It's often as funny as flashy. <br /> <br /> The remarkable scenes include an obscene and brutal vaudeville number interpreted for the prisoners, as well as a powerful dream / fantasy sequence for Superintendent McQueen (obviously) horror icon Barbara Steele, making a wonderful turn in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a burglary scene that went awry and a car theft scene that was simply scary. As in other films of this kind, it is also commendable that it is as much a portrait of the empowerment of women as a real exploitation. These women are tough, they take no garbage, and are more than able to take care of themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast makes the most of their roles: Juanita Brown in the role of the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the beautiful sassy, ​​Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and shy Lavelle, Gavin as the new came to wide-eyed and Lynda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside. <br /> <br /> As our climax is playing, Demme arrives with a tense final "beating the clock" as our heroes run to save Belle from being lobotomized by the predator Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller) , the kind of man who does not think about taking advantage of women. . <br /> <br /> Bouncing on John Cales' tasty score, "Caged Heat" is a stimulating entertainment and a guaranteed good time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
