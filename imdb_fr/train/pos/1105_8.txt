The inhabitants of Manhattan apartments must endure all kinds of inconveniences. The worst is the lack of storage space! Some people who eat all the time outside use their stoves and their dishwashers as storage spaces because the cupboards are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a superb team of comedy writers of that time, understood the potential of Eric Hodgins' novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can not stand the narrow apartment where he has to share his wife Muriel, and his two daughters. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, had it! When he sees an advertisement for Connecticut, he decides to take a look at it. Obviously, as a first-time homeowner, Jim is fooled by the real estate man by buying the dilapidated house that he is being inspected by an unscrupulous agent. This is only the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Anything that can go wrong goes wrong. The architect is asked to present a plan that does not work for the new house, once the original one has been shaved. As one problem leads to another, it takes more money, and whatever the initial cost, it results in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun because of the three principles in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and made the most of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who has always been effective playing alongside Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old friend of Myrna who became a lawyer for the Blandings, is sweet and easy-going, like Melvin Douglas. Joan, one of the Blandings girls, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who looked like Eva Marie Saint. The awesome Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> The film was lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film look better. The direction of H.C. Potter is light and he has managed this film that will delight lovers of classic comedies.
