It could have been better if it had been headed by a more experienced person. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not a great cinematic art job. <br /> <br /> It is however a beautiful film. I like it since the local channels show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (Many like "The Fallen Idol" but I'm not among them, I think I've seen "Brighton Rock" many years ago and I liked it, but maybe I'm just thinking of the novel.) is beautifully presented. It is true that Charles Boyer is not Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character - tired, suspicious, caring. Lauren Bacall appeals as a British girl who falls in love. But the support players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. His performance is a little Grand Guignol, but I attribute it to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we meet for the first time by teaching Boyer a lesson in a universal language similar to Esperanto, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. She appears as an early teenager early. The character wants to be useful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservations. The reserve is, mainly, that it's a little lazy. But history and play can hardly be improved.
