What an exceptional film do not I have words to describe? I do not know why the movie's rating is 7.3 but 9.3 but anyway, no one else can make this movie and the acting game by Akshay is simply outstanding. The second half of the movie makes you cry and the movie has a really good late ending that makes the movie perfect. you should watch this movie once, I think twice it's up to you to play. Anyway, I like this movie and it's not only sad and funny, but it also gives us a very good sense and what you should do, so I think it's one of the best movies in Bollywood history. but I know the people have deferent so choose ya. The only thing I do not like in this film is the music and the background music is good, but the songs are not good enough. I think the music would be better if AR Rahman would be the music director, but anyway, we can not do anything. about it, then.
