If you have trouble suspending disbelief, it's not for you. Consider: a woman already at the end of the Middle Ages finds a newborn in a cabbage field and raises it as his own. Think about it; she makes no attempt to locate the mother, who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment, and apparently no one from the Italian equivalent of social services is trying to put the baby under "care" (no social services? now I KNOW it's a fantasy). Before you know it, the young Toto is about ten years old and his adoptive mother dies leaving him to the orphanage from which he comes, a HAPPY man who loves everyone. In no way did he not only give his suitcase to the man who stole it, but organized the local homeless into authentic Shantytown residents and, for a reminder, he led them into a struggle against capitalism under the form of the businessman who buys the land. Shantytown is on the discovery of oil. This means that you have to swallow without the subsequent "miracles", when the deceased mother of Toto (the old lady who raised her rather than the biological) appeared to her and handed her a dove that also serves as a magic wand. allowing him to meet the finale in which the hobos fly to a better place probably somewhere over the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is up to par with Charm and is easy to capitulate. In the balance sheet, a small masterpiece.
