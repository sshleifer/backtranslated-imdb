This film is a moving and incredible work. I saw him at the theater when he came out, but I was only 13 years old and I did not really understand him ... I saw him again when I was 20 years old (in video of course and I own it now) and was just blown away. Steven Spielberg has created a beautiful movie that will wrap you from beginning to end. I read the book too, but there is something in the film that really makes it alive. casting, acting, music, costumes, sets, everything, just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you applaud ... it brings out all the emotions imaginable. it is one of his finest works and not to be missed!
