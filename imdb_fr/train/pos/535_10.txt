A question of life and death, what can you really say that would do justice to the genius and beauty of this film? The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger knows no bounds, each frame is filled with incredibly bold compositions. The shifts between the bold colors of the "real world" and the black and white of the sky are ingenious, showing us visually how life is more alive. The final scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend the stairs to the sky to hold the trial over Peter's operation (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All the performances are on the spot (Roger Livesey is remarkable), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, there has never been a film more romantic than this one (if I do not have never been seen that). A question of life and death concerns the power of love and the importance of life. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, its way of illuminating Kim Hunter's face makes it all the more beautiful, what a genius it can give the thrilling impression of simple things like a game table tennis. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound was deafened at vital moments was a decisive factor ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> It's a real classic that can restore everyone's confidence in the cinema, underestimated at its initial release and by the public That's why I give this film a 10/10 , in a word - beautiful.
