I really enjoyed this movie, but it's not new. <br /> <br /> Everyone groups it here with other war movies, this movie was misclassified! It's no more a war movie than "We flew over the nest of cuckoos" is a film about the asylum or "Cool Hand Luke" is a film about the prison. It's a film about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the costs of this type of personality. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "We flew over the nest of cuckoos" and "Cool Hand Luke", his in good company, and he holds his. These are the films that we have to contrast and compare, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
