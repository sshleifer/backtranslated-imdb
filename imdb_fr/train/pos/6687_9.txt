Although I can not pretend to be a fanatic comic, I read my part, so I guess I'm part of the audience of this movie and I was not disappointed. It almost runs out of steam, almost overflowing with ideas and it seems that Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, was left on the floor of the editing room. In addition, a bit of Blue Raja from Hank Azaria can go very far. Yet it is easy to forgive all these mistakes when you have such a fun movie. All actors seem to be having fun with their roles, especially William H. Macy in Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo in The Bowler. And unlike some, I found that the design of the city made the joke even more funny. I also liked how disco was the favorite music of the wicked; In a way, it seemed appropriate.
