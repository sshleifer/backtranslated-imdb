I rarely felt that a film could be visionary. But clearly, this film has the seeds of a premonition. <br /> <br /> We should not have a tendency to be alarmist and to see armageddon in something because it seems to match our emotions of the moment. But did not we say that of "1984"? James Orwell had he known that the Internet had become reality shortly after 1984? In fact, it was in 1994; he might have reconsidered the writing of his story as he did. The retreat rewarded. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. What is important is that we often think of ourselves as superior to our environment but that we actually get excited about an "apple of love" when necessity knocks on us. A snapshot of ourselves at an old age. <br /> <br /> Whichever schedule suits us, I know for a fact that we have not seen the beginning yet. <br /> <br />
