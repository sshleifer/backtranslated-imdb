Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man searching for answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow all perform first-rate performances in their respective roles; Ms. Phillips has the somewhat less desirable task of trying to spice up a movie made for television (twenty-five years ago), providing "sexual interest" in an otherwise asexual movie. The real star, however, is the "California Kid"; a 1934 Ford coupe, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, presented in front of a camera and subjected to a training session that will leave the spectator speechless, panting and holding the edge of the seat with impatience breathless. <br /> <br /> The action the scenes are spectacular (even if some dialogues are a little lame), allowing a good evening. This is how all "car movies" should be made. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it's well worth the missed sleep.
