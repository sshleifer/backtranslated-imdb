It's an excellent British film. A cleverly watched scenario with many lines that can be quoted, which perfectly describes what magic mushrooms can do to a man during a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent with the most underrated British actor Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a seal coming out of his mouth is a master shot of the cast and Gary Stretch with his sullen air brings something strange atmosphere to the play. Although it seems to be presented as a biker movie, I think it will find an audience outside of this, solely on the premise that a lot of people have done it and got the t-shirt. An excellent soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This could really be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. Like the weed in the Welsh fields: it's a farmer!
