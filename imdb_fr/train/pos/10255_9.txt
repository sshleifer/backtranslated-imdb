This film is the first of six infamous films about the guinea pig and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, knowing that the film is a fake. The story tells the story of a woman who was captured and tortured in different ways. At the beginning of the story, a man receives a letter without return address, which includes a video manga showing the torture. The men who capture her test the limits of a human before dying. Some scenes are shocking, like the eyeball scene and others are not, like the girl who is hit 100 times, because you see punches in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of gore, so I recommend it to people 17 years and older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
