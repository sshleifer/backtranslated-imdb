I just read the main commentary of this film which makes the headlines with the results of the vote and a decreasing distribution. <br /> <br /> Why can not some people take a movie for what it's supposed to be for? be. <br /> <br /> This movie is supposed to be light, humorous, family comedy, things to make kids laugh and things for adults, and that's exactly what this movie does. <br /> <br /> I burst out laughing while listening to this movie. I thought Carey was doing a great performance and the whole movie (if it was being watched at Christmas) really made you feel like a party <br /> <br /> to all movie critics, stop trying to look like to movie students and hit every movie because it's not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take movies for what they're supposed to be, entertainment!
