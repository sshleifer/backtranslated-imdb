I know you're already in film festivals (or at least I think you may have invented it), but I think it should include the "best animated short film" in every film. Bravo. I can not wait to see the whole movie. I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but listen to it now and accept it as the truth. Well done, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Even though I still think so. And here is another -SHOE! - and I can not stop here for now. It is extremely annoying and yet I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably watch all your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon". I have a lot. <br /> <br /> -R
