I saw it during a screening last night too. I was blown away by the quality of this film compared to my expectations. Few films can combine both a black comedy and a current event drama and not collapse in the conclusion. <br /> <br /> I will not mind repeating the plot because the less you know about the filming of this film makes it much better. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. He was funny and much more funny than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle was credible, as always. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good rhythm. I would say that 90% of the audience laughed during most of the movie. Halfway through the movie, the time is slow and the work is really nice. <br /> <br /> I also found that it was really cool not to play with a black friend / white friend, they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.
