I did not know what to expect with this one, apart from the positive reviews I read. It turns out that I could never have imagined this film, because it is very close to "The white-haired bride" because of its lyrical character and its fantastic. It's a joke, a comedy and just a good old ghost story. This is not frightening, it's not the theme, it's mostly a love story about a grumpy guy who meets a beautiful ghost, who has a lot of problems with other ghosts. The main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This is also happening in ancient China, with wild displays of extravagant Kung Fu and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are at the top. I could watch this kind of Chinese movies all day, because they are very funny, with great graphics and an almost ironic language. And I'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie too. Highly recommended.
