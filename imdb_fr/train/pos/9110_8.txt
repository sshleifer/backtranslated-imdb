You know? Our mind is based on this revolution, it is asleep ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... Until then, on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have freedom of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom of speech! All this is a consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think he has some mistakes in the game of some characters, but by the way, I watch Portuguese movies, it's pretty good !! I really like!
