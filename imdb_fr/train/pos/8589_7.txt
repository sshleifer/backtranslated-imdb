I'll be honest, I finally checked this movie, not because of the stars - even if they were reasonably observable and convincing, especially the three main tracks - or even the fascinating story of a breach in the secret service Presidential (Something I 've been informed by the DVD extras of this show, it has not been done yet, assuming that is true, it is remarkable! I got it because it was made and has a cameo choice by none other than Inspector Meldrick Lewis !! Well, okay, Clark Johnson, one of my favorites of "Homicide: Life on the Street" and an experienced TV director (mostly). I would say that he does just about everything he can with an observable but fairly average project, despite the possibilities. <br /> <br /> Veteran and secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) must find out. both of them singing AND killing his friend, targeting and blowing up an Air Force One helicopter and firing for the Prez (David Rasche, someone remembers "Sledgehammer"?). His affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the first ladies HOTTER we had, fictional or real) certainly will not help. He must both search the real mole in the service and avoid the hunting dog as chasing from his former best friend and fellow officer and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, almost always completely in "24" mode). Add to that other essential service agents (Martin Donovan and the foxy, a little hard to buy like Eva Longorria) and shady foreign characters and you get a fairly classic political thriller that does not aim as high as it claims and reaches the desired goal. , so disappointing, the results. <br /> <br /> The summary line is about the best way to describe how this show goes without giving spoilers. The DVD supplements seemed to me more insightful and interesting than the movie, although the movie itself was entertaining enough to interest most people (me included).
