A wonderful and powerful war movie that focuses on the inner turmoil of blind sailor Al Schmid. Although it's difficult and unpleasant, it's finally heroic - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression. The fight scene was superb. But a bone to choose. No matter how many .50 bullets they have fired, I have never seen any water or soil being ejected by the impacts! It hurts realism, but I can live with it. Nice performance of Eleanor Parker, again, as a girlfriend.
