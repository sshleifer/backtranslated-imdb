I watched this movie not expecting much and knowing nothing at all. I liked it. A very good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat deaf girl and the ex-crank, and a pace that allows things to flow without being in a hurry. <br /> <br /> A much better movie than Beat my heart stopped, boring and amazing. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not work was that the fat girl supposedly ugly was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from being beautiful in a conventional way, but with so much character that she took up the screen every time she was on it. Superb. I wish it was in more movies, and better than it usually is. I saw a little of Gilles's wife and a little mustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and I saw everything from Beat my heart stopped, and it's definitely garbage. She seems to have some to come, so I'm going to cross my fingers.
