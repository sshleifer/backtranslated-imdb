DOCTOR PETIOT, with Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who cares for the sick in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. Yet, it attacks the weakest in the population. The images and cinematography are superb and add an extra macabre feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Attractive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculator and murderer. A certain film not to be forgotten by the spectator. Congratulations to Mr. Serrault for his chilling portrait.
