BSG is one of my favorite television series of all time. I was lucky to start watching it as the series entered its final season. It was an end-to-end marathon for me and what an incredible race! <br /> <br /> As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu, I knew exactly what I was looking for just by the title - Caprica! Although some things do not match when you compare the two series, they are still beautifully executed. There was no mention of holobands in Battlestar Galactica or virtual worlds, but I may not have talked enough about the series so they could explain why. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to all those who love the universe, the technology and the alternative fantasies of our world. This show is very interesting and will make you want to watch more!
