This film is more lupine than most, especially Funimation. Apart from the bad dubbing, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a bit like the comic book (this is the basis of all the Lupine on which the third object is). Lupine is trying to win a huge treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness towards women to try to draw something from this situation. The last bit is not so bad, he is with another woman, but of course, Fujiko is still his number one. <br /> <br /> Many other Lupine films are more familiar than Lupine. I think any good Lupine fan will be pleasantly surprised (I know after hearing so many bad things about this movie). It might be a little better without the small animations that parade during the credits (they are a little soft), but overall, it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few movies I would still watch in Lupine III.
