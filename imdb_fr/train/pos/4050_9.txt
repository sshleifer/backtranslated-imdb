Anyone who finds this film boring is a desperate fool who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies. This film is fascinating and has no boring moment. Why? Because it is largely composed of an intelligent dialogue between real people in times of crisis and describes in detail their efforts to survive. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all Rohmer films and that is why many people do not like them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those of us who have taste and discrimination will continue to look for movies like this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talkative". Well, it is, but for me, it's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was talkative too. Is there a more meaningful piece than "Hamlet?" Whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts of values, it is necessary that these ideas and values ​​be discussed, which is largely what is discussed in this film. Aristocracy and noble birth against egalitarianism; a loyalty to old friends that is put to the test when that friend takes what we believe to be a bad way; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person who owns it is not so nice, or even despicable. (Has anyone ever heard of Dostoyevsky or "crime and punishment?") This is what this film is about. <br /> <br /> The two main roles of this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as a second language, is particularly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and see this fascinating movie. This may be the last movie on this master screen.
