I really liked 101 Dalmations when he was released in 1996, now 5 years later, I went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, I found that fantastic, but I think 101 is better because I think it's is more funny, more humorous, and also this movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred dalmations (1961), I wonder if it is planned to do 103 Dalmations. yes, maybe yes, maybe no, all of us, fans of dalmations, will have to discover if there will be 103 dalmations in the future.
