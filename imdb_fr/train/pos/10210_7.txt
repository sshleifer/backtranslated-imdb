It's not really a good movie, but I admire the writers and the director for trying something a little different. The main theme of the film is fate and seemingly insignificant little things that can greatly change the future. In a way, it reminds me of the movie SLIDING DOORS, although instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random events occur repeatedly and everyone contributes to the cute conclusion. Plus, a weird bald guy seems to understand all of this and he talks about it for a brief scene - as if he's an omnipotent being, but there's absolutely no explanation about him in the movie clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). <br /> <br /> The jacket of the DVD only shows Audrey Tautou. This is to capitalize on his success in AMELIE, although she is only one of the many actors of the film and there is no main role. The pace is fast, the acting is good and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I did not get the highest score was that some characters were a little uninteresting and I think the movie might have been tightened with a little less subplots.
