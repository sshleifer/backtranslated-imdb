This moving and hilarious film fascinated me, not to mention my astonishment. I was also surprised to find that Paulie's voice was played by Jay Mohr. The performance was so finely nuanced, not moving in schmaltz and not getting too hard under New Jersey boastfulness, I thought it must have been an old-time underrated pro, not Mr. Mohr's pale face. A very impressive performance, indeed, and it is gratifying to see his talents taken seriously in a series of independent and unusual films.
