This anime has seriously shaken my socks. When the anime opened for the first time, I felt it was too slow; The story had not really progressed and Shirou was a rather unimpressive male role. Once you learn more about tracing, and learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War, the story unfolds and you can see the many facets evolve together. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> In addition, I had the impression that the way the characters were developing was very faithful to the reality, to the way real people were developing, in the real world. There were no completely obvious stupid things going on; Ilya and Rin's development was interesting to watch, but I think that the way Shirou and Saber grew up in certain personalities was just interesting to look at. Some "surprise" people who came forward (Gilgamesh?) Also seemed to be unique from the rest of the cast, meaning we did not replace "Generic Bad-ass A" with "Generic". Bad-ass B "from the death of A. <br /> <br /> Etdd, I loved the music, the opening music rocked and the final theme of the final episode came from ... Seriously, the theme the last episode was put in. Good job, Type-MOON!
