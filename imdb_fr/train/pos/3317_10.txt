Bette Midler is still Divine! Extremely humorous. Burlesque lovers. Able to make you cry with old jokes with new dresses or just with old songs with more power and punch than ever. All in All Sing new ballads, powerfully sing the good old / perennials such as "The Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "Wind under my wings". The best way to appreciate Miss Divine M has always been liberated - since it's the second best thing to do, I highly recommend it to all, with a mixture of Enchanting and Adult Recognition with wide-eyed eyes and desire mischievous child to push back all the limits!
