I think the movie was a little weird. In the opening scene, a person is killed for no reason. He is no longer mentioned. The special effects could have been better too, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. This is not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a good movie. I give him about 5 out of 10 of the scale.
