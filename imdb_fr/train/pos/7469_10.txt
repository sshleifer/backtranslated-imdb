This movie was absolutely great. It made me think. Throughout the movie, I was confused like hell. I loved everything ... it was so confusing and so crooked and weird that it was hard not to like it. All the actors were phenomenal and nobody could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... he deserves an ocar.
