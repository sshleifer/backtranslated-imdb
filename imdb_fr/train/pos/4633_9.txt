Here is another beauty in the chain of beautiful films made by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of cursed lovers (an Israeli, a Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness stems not only from its description of interethnic conflicts, but also from personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, there is a moment when one of the openly gay, secondary characters gets a visit to his boyfriend's hospital, who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his family, which causes a wave of clumsy discomfort. wash through the room. It is clear that the young man is not as open as he seems and that the family does not accept what he wants, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. Much of the complexity is packaged in a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is an expert in the effective compression of emotional and psychological complexity into short sequences. The film is also effective for the impartial way of presenting the mutual brutalities inflicted between Israelis and Palestinians. If you are not without heart, you will cry until the last third of the film. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and interpreted that it reminds us how good the melodrama can be.
