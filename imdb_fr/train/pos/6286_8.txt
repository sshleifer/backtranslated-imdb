left in 60 seconds. Where did I start? This allows you to stay in the movie with action and funky cars. people say it's not a good movie, I do not agree with the fact that it has cute parts, but what the action movie does not have. I gave him an 8 out of 10 cause of action and comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off that this movie will not disappoint you. Good work with one of the most underrated actors of my mind Del-Roy Lindo. I think that sometimes people go too far in the movies, sometimes you have to sit down to enjoy the movie and after wondering if we managed to get what they showed. which means that if they went into action, was it an action pact? If they were trying to make a movie to change the way movies are filmed and to try to win every prize they have? I think they did the action movie that they decided to do, give it a chance and you will not be sorry.
