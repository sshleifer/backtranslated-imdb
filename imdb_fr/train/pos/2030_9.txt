The Man from Snowy River II does not reinvent the wheel, but is a beautiful movie that will appeal to everyone and has excellent ratings. <br /> <br /> For fans looking for the elements that made the original Man From Snowy River hit movie (breathtaking landscapes, complete score, sweet romance and wild action), this film really holds true . This story takes a few years from the end of the first. Jim (Tom Burlinson) left to amass his fortune in a brood of draft horses. He comes back to where he left off with his well-known sweetheart Jessica (incarnated by the divine Australian lady Sigrid Thornton), who is still trying to free herself from her corseted education at the cattle station of her pen (Harrison is now played by the American Brian Dennehy). Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie), a posh upper class, is targeting Jessica's case. Add to that social tensions around the land and stallions with a bad attitude of the first film and this is the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the acting game. Tom Burlinson perfectly fits Jim's wide-brimmed hat and terse humor. Sigrid Thornton is a beautiful heroine and both have a real chemistry on the screen. Filling Kirk Douglas' solid shoes has never been easy, and Brian Dennehy tramps and screams but never feels very authentic in this game. <br /> <br /> The music is sumptuous and lush and cinematography could be a roll of a Victoria touring reel. There are times, however, that feel very complacent, as the director just wants another photo of the helicopter runners to show how beautiful the scenery is without human drama. A little more grain would have been enough here, we are Australians, we can support it !! There are some very difficult moments with the stallion who defy belief. But what is funny in this film is that among some clich√©s screaming, there are scenes really inventive and touching. Jim puts the saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before the hour) Jim and Jessica settle down at home, the fabulous scene where Jim shows the riding of Alistair with his faithful whip. I can see why this character is such an icon. <br /> <br /> In short, a very pleasant sequel. Hoping that everyone involved wants to create another one. the Snowy River III man: the CRAIGS. I'm sure we'd all like to see how Jim and Jessica are doing on their farm. <br /> <br /> The Australian DVD contains some extra scenes. It's worth it if you're already a fan.
