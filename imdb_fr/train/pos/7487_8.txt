I really enjoyed this film because I am very interested in American history ... in Antebellum's years and in the civil war in particular. I recently bought it from a basket of previously viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and was very happy to add it to my collection of videos on the story. Although not of the caliber of civil war films such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg", provides a lot of history about the pre-war fraternity among the cadets at West Point. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's gray uniforms, youth or military discipline, but I'm fascinated by the history of the Cadet Corps from around 1830 to the brink of war . I imagine what it must have been to be sitting in a classroom with other young men, learn to go to war, and then put lessons to work against your own classmates later! <br /> <br /> In fact, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. the film makes no mention of it except Henry A. DuPont, first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, last graduate of the June promotion. the reason for the two courses was not so much the war, but the result of returning to a four-year course, after a few years of experimentation with a five-year course (I think the first attended five years, the other during four years). As the film describes, the cadets were like brothers and often called each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class of 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say that this film is "Santa Fe Trail" as it should have been because this 1940 film, while being nice, really distorts the story. Cadets from several different classes graduate together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are described as the best friends in the world and are side by side to end Harper's Ferry's 1859 uprising of John Brown. In fact, Stuart and Custer have never been friends, but enemies during the war. They fought (for the first time, I think) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was on Harper's raid ferry, but Custer was still junior at the peak as it unfolded). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custer plays a role in "Class of '61", although her classmates, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton, are fictional. I think they are respectively based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can watch. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really appreciate this film or any other film with a window on the mid-nineteenth century. America.
