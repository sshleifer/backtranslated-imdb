During the war, Hollywood made many films designed to garner public support for our troops. Nowadays, some might reject them or simply think of them as propaganda - which they are technically, but of a positive nature and intended to unify the nation. This film is a fairly effective and entertaining example of its kind: its scenario is quite realistic and its production values ​​are good. Pat O'Brien plays pretty much the same character he has played in LOTS of other movies (you know, the hard guy to talk, hard but "swell guy"). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan among the bombers in training). Although the story recalls several other films about our pilots and our crews, the film is well enough designed to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. It may be with the exception of the end - where the film is a bit exaggerated but also VERY satisfying. The only serious disadvantage, which concerns especially nitpickers, is that certain archive sequences are integrated in a rather vague way in the film and that "crazies" like me, history teachers and lover of the plane, will probably notice it - all the others probably. do not notice.
