"Almost Nothing" is perhaps not the best movie of all time ... But it's better than many of you have already said. I still have not seen a film about homo better than this one. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching very narrative films, with a clear beginning, development and result. But European films are less narrative, but make you think a lot. <br /> <br /> Many of you have not understood the meaning of the film. The purpose of this one is not to show us a simple "summer". love movie ", with commercial characters who" fall in love and live happily ever after. "The summer holidays and the beach are just a background, and this film is meant for all the young boys who can feel identified to these boys. <br /> <br /> Some of you may not have well understood this movie, because of its 3 parts, shown as flashbacks.These 3 moments are: - Summer In Pornichet, when they meet and love.-After a year and a half of living together in Nantes, Mathieu does not go to the psychiatrist, he tries to kill himself by taking something and CÃ©dric takes him to the hospital. Later, he seems to talk to a psychiatrist to find out why he did this.-The last part is Mathieu's return to Pornichet, in winter, alone ... to think about how his life has changed, to his future life and in search of himself. <br /> <br /> possible that some people can not Do not understand everything, because all the scenes are mixed together. But anyway, as I said before ... it's not a funny movie. If we want to see meat, we have Belami movies. <br /> <br /> Almost Nothing wants to show us how cruel life can be for a boy who is not sure. about his feelings and not sure what to do in life. Mathieu only wants to leave home and try to live the kind of life he thought he could bring happiness .. But what seemed perfect at first ... later is not as good as he thought, and he is troubled, and feel that he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. He eventually becomes depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? Is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? only a few .. but it's not an entertainment movie. Is everything about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, misfortune, pain, depression, loneliness ... Me, like so many others, I feel identified with the life and problems of Mathieu, and that's what the director wanted to do .. a movie that show us the cruel reality of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best film on the theme of homo.
