One of those brilliant young men who dared to do everything and dared to make a love movie for teenagers (can I really call him that? He would summon the devil of his fans) on a micro-budget but filled maturity. Peter Sollett, you deserve more admiration and respect. Thank you once again for demonstrating to the powerful in the industry that stereotypes can be eliminated from the toilet. A place, a handful of rich characters, a limited budget, good acting (and amateurs too), proper lighting - fans of true independent cinema should look more and stop watching ... well .. . you know what.
