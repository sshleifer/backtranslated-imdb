Man On Fire tells the story of a former Special Forces member with a drinking problem who accepts a small girl's bodyguard in Mexico during the ransom kidnapping wave. At first, he is not too friendly, but then they make friends, he decides to stop drinking, etc. etc etc ... then one day, she is kidnapped ... and is murdered ... <br /> <br /> And he will stop at nothing to take his revenge. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the story of Man On Fire, but expect big twists at least a few times, including the end that is beautiful and will probably make you cry. <br /> <br /> It's also because of the excellent music that Harry-Gregson Williams and Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) composed. <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait .. the problem is that everything is perfect. <br /> <br /> First actor. Denzel Washington is at its best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken are good, as always, the great Radtha Mitchell and the beautiful young Dakota Fanning. And this is not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the dazzling cinematography which, with superb editing, should have won an Oscar for sure. <br /> <br /> The story is ... not just a revenge movie. The story is smart, the story makes you think ... and is pure beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you have to watch while you're alive, at least once!
