For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror comic book, watching this movie is an exercise in nostalgia. In this context, it's wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy soft and miss the fact that the actors are cartoon characters. The plot is also a little soft for today's audience, but reflects very well the naïveté of the 40s and 50s. Jane, you certainly remember, was part of the wartime fantasy of fantasy, created to boost the morale of the troops. She gave a double meaning to the "strip" in the cartoon. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would have been familiar to readers of this era, a plethora of Nazis baffled upset by some English as upset and located in the African jungle of course. <br /> <br /> For Jane's fans, a must see. For the rest of you, a wet kernel. <br /> <br />
