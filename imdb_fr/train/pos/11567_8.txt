In the 1930s, the studios used short films like this one as a testing ground for new actors, given the relative ease of their production compared to feature films. It is interesting to note that this should be interpreted by Shirley Temple, who has been established for a long time. herself as the most famous child of all time. Again, it was probably not her who was tested. I guess it was Frank Coghlan Jr., who played Shirley's brother, Sonny, in the movie and gave a comparatively less impressive performance. Again, 9-year-old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy act to accompany. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an unimaginative gag of sight with a leaky ceiling, which I suppose was designed for Shirley Temple to cast a scornful look at the ceiling, illustrate the status of the Worker family in the movie and offer a clear transition to the next scene, in which Shirley was happily stamping in the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sonny's birthday there, and his father makes sometimes horrible efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog he really wants, but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten once and he was scared since. It is curious that when his father insists on having a dog, Sonny decides to run away from home rather than having a dog at home. As he flees without a destination in sight, it is also curious that the film illustrates what seems to be indifferent to the homeless, even beyond the astonishing indifference that exists today. <br /> <br /> Sonny walks past a man cooking bacon in an iron pan at the edge of the railroad (just past a train, given how close he was to tracks, you would think the guy would have made it off the track, but whatever). After Sonny has given up sharing breakfast because of the stern look that his cheerful smile receives from the guy, he continues and the homeless guy disappears from the movie. It is interesting to consider what a long film would have done, because it leaves this poor guy in a cowardly state. <br /> <br /> That's not what matters, Sonny soon hears a dog groan under a bridge as he passes. and jump to find a dog covered with burrs. It may seem banal to take the dog immediately and adopt it because he just left the house because of his fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he just needed to remind him of his power over the dogs, but their lack of power over him. As soon as he saw a dog in need, he overcame his fear. <br /> <br /> Hey, if that's all it takes, all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I'm ready! <br /> <br /> This is a very handy movie in which everything is going exactly as it is supposed to be, but pretty cute and pretty nice (and pretty short, so to speak) to stay a fun movie. We're not already expecting an epic plot in a 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pups still contains a substantial amount of story and character developments in record time. And it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud. I'm not an expert on Shirley Temple's films, but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous child star of all time.
