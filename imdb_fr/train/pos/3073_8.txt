This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to do more. No extravagant accessories, no car chases, no intelligent lining. Just people who are dealing with human beings. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays an improbable hitman who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the obedient son, Sutherland is the dominant father. The son wants to leave the company, the father will not leave him. Macy loves her own son, superbly performed by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his needs with those of his family. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and her little boy. And as you would expect in a film with William Macy, there is also a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent work, actor and director. It's nice to know that they can always make a good movie in Hollywood on a budget.
