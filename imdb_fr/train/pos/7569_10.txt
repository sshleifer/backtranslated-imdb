At a time in our culture where reality as a narrative is an overwhelming fiction as we know it on the big screen, "Apart From That" is a movie that exposes real life moments that feel more honest, cooler and more innovative than I have seen before. The usual spoon feeding conventions do not exist in this film, which allows a satisfied audience to sit and watch these real-life moments flowing one after the other to the screen. Looking at the film, and even after contemplation, it's hard to believe that these amazing performances were actually performances. Every moment spent with the big distribution of actors was felt as the truth exposed in everyday life. Still, "Apart From That" does not feel like a documentary or reality show, but instead transcends a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. I can not wait to see this new category of narration continue with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This film must be seen.
