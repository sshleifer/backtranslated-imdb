I had seen this film several years before and it left me with a lasting impression. Alas, I endured a lot of movies over the years and I did not expect to be impressed by 'Kalifornia' after watching these movies again recently. I am happy to say that he is just as unnerving and observable as he was ten years ago. <br /> <br /> Two things are really behind the power of this movie. The first is his casting. Young Brad Pitt is incredibly unsettling as Early Grace. Knowing Pitt, as we all do, as one of Hollywood's most enduring heartbeats, it's comforting to watch him play such a vile and unattractive character. Pitt leaves the show without resorting to a cliche or parody in the white basket and manages to remain truly terrifying throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is as impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend, playing the character as a decade old girl with forty years of life experience. Lewis manages to evoke pity (for the role of her character in life) as well as scorn (for her naivety), but she supports her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by such a young actor. Personally, I think it's tragic that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for rewards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfect actors of the Yuppy couple who unwittingly end up traveling around the United States with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is geeky and na√Øve, and Forbes seems cynical and closed, but both actors manage to convincingly portray the changes in their characters, as they are also intrigued, repulsed and strangely attracted to Pitt. <br /> <br /> Next to a beautiful casting and a uniformly brilliant actor's game, this film really captures us by the proverbial balls with its impeccable rhythm. At the time of the release of 'Kalifornia', Hollywood released a series of cool movies that turn to the psyche ('Single White Female', 'Pacific Heights', 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle', "Cheated", "Sleeping with 'enemy', etc.). Most of these films followed the same formula, the only difference being the nature of the relationship between good and bad. 'Kalifornia' does not really distance itself from this territory, but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow-moving thriller, and we are held at the edge of our seats waiting for the wind to turn. <Br/> <br /> When the price goes down, and Pitt lets himself go to play the nasty maniac, the movie changes completely and the last twenty minutes are not up to the rest of the movie. That said, the action is thick and fast and the resolution is cold. The battle is over, but the scars will still be there. <br /> <br /> Much of the narration (provided by a slightly whiny file, pre-file X, Duchovony) is a little artificial. Of course, this is supposed to come from the book written by the Duchovony journalist character. It might be argued, then, that timid storytelling is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensational style that most journalists write. <br /> <The film is largely a success and certainly exceeds 90% of the thrillers of the last twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak of the stomach or the mind. This film is disturbing in more ways than one. But then, it's supposed to be.
