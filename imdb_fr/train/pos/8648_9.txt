Kalifornia is a film about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest road of all time. The road of no return. The plot is about a couple who are trying to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that took place in America and his daughter - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures. They have therefore embarked on a series of famous assassinations without knowing what awaits them on the way. To share the travel costs, they decide to find another couple and put an ad. But the couple who responds is not just any couple. It's one of the strangest couples of all time. The girl is a naive and fragile creature who dreams a lot and loves cacti. The man is exactly the opposite. A cruel and ruthless murderer. We learn this at the beginning of the film and we follow him throughout his trip to Kalifornia (not with C as usual, but with K, probably symbolizing the word killer), throughout his course of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. All the main roles, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes give very good performances and you have to take into account the fact that when this film was shot, none of them was a star. The photography is incredible, the darkness covering most of the film and the music adapting to the darkness of the film. Overall, it's a very good movie. Do not miss it. You will think again before taking a stranger in your car to share the essence!
