Steve Carell has made the career a strange character, first in 'The Daily Show', then in various minor roles. In Virgin, Carell has found an intelligent and hilarious scenario that makes perfect use of her assets. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who leads a quiet and lonely life. Andy is a bit strange, but in a kind awkward kind. One night, while in contact with his colleagues for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His colleagues David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it is clear that all three have some respect for the honest human being that Andy is, and they decide to help him by helping him put an end to his virginity. And so begins Andy's quest as an adult. Andy is the innocent par excellence, and the bulk of the humor comes from his naivety in the situations in which he finds himself throughout the film. Some of the humor is rude, but most of the time, it's just a smart comedy done well. In addition, I found some parts of the film very touching as Andy finds himself developing relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I do not try to describe the film as a love story or a drama; it's a comedy that rolls in your seats. Yet every good comedy I've ever seen contains enough heart to worry about the characters. A good comparison would be "The Wedding Crashers" earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar sense of humor, but may be a bit more vulgar in some of her jokes. I particularly liked the end of the film, which I thought was an ideal way to finish the film. Without revealing anything, it reminded me "Something about Mary". Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly what you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.
