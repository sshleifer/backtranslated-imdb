After seeing this film a few months ago, it keeps coming back in my consciousness and I feel that I have to buy it or at least see it again, even if I have seen it at least 3 times when I rented it at this moment. <br /> <I fell in love with the realization of Hal Hartley many years ago. I discovered that these films could make me laugh in a place that is rarely entertained. It's a strange feeling, okay, and I guess most people really do not understand, or it makes them confusing and somewhat uncomfortable - I guess I really understand - it's like these movies were made for me. <br /> <br /> Although I do not remember if I laughed well, this film remains one of the funniest movies I've seen in many years. If you do not see the humor of Fay's grocery bag on the street at a church, at his brother's publisher's office, at his son's director's office, you may lack intelligence to be very impressed by this movie. The bag is a silent character in itself, dragged as an icon of motherhood that Parker Posey, usually impetuous, must wear before the international plot of the rest of the film submerged. <br /> <br /> I consider "Henry Fool" my least favorite of Hartley's films. Honestly, I do not remember it very well. I think the character himself was so odious that I found it tedious. Hartley's strong point seems to be the development of the female character. <br /> <br /> Aside from Posey's brilliance, it was a pleasure to see Elina Lowensohn again, one of my favorite actresses. His extravagant naivety is perfect for the direction of Hartley. His ability to trivialize this scandalous contributes to define his style as a delicious chronic irony. <br /> <br /> This film leads to a very relevant international plot, which explains the political situations in Afghanistan. This is never suspected at first. The complexity of the development of this film is unprecedented. <br /> <br /> It's the embodiment of an "autonomous" sequel. The less you know about Henry Fool, the mysterious the mystery is, the less you expect it to appear near the end of the film - as a distributor of alcoholic chain smoker complaints, throwing insults at its Islamist terrorist guardian who seems to be respect somehow. . It's as if I discover that Santa Claus is a 12 year old schoolyard bully. <br /> <br /> Although I was impressed and pleased with Hartley's recent films "The Girl from Monday" and "No Such Thing", "Fay Grim" goes well beyond what I I expected, with a sense of humor and originality that no Oscar winner would ever dare.
