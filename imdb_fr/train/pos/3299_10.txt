A great film requiring an acquired taste. If you like movies, if you hate romance, then it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good smart movie from time to time, I highly recommend it. Without a doubt the best film produced in Bollywood during this century. <br /> <br /> The only other Indian movie I would give 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya The Jayenge. Even then, he comes second to this masterpiece.
