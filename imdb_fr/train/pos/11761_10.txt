Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives from his glories of the past, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare and key performance of Jack Dundee. He dropped the Big Pass for more than one reason. <br /> <br /> You will see some of the most quoted scenes ever written in a movie, like Jack whistling against a rat, Reno posing and the call of the caribou coming out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic that is not afraid to show football in the mud the way it should be played (note to the NFL).
