Looking at some of the negative messages, you really have to wonder what some people are doing to be entertained .... <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see the movie during its theatrical short film . The audience laughed. I'm watching a tape while I'm typing and it's still funny! <br /> <br /> It also has a soft side, with unexpected turns of real pathos. The late great Royal Dano is particularly effective as a lonely and desperate farmer, Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are great as children. And actors in Martian costumes, although limited to mime, do a great job. <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for is the details of the background. The film is full of tributes, pastiches and references to other SF and fantasy films. Take a look at Martian costumes next time. One of them is wearing a Marty McFly costume, another is a Ghostbuster, a third is in Atreides House uniform and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter flight suit.
