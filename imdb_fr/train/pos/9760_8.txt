I have a great memory of this film, as I had seen it with my two younger sisters in his first theatrical appearance in 1977, at the age of eight. Apparently, this was considered a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (the panoramic and digitized videocassette - which has never done justice to the picture or its ambitious compositions of Panavision is now exhausted.) The film is very stylized ( nuances of YELLOW SUBMARINE) and certainly unequal. Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite, while others are rather juvenile and not very distinguished. The sad discarded blue camel (shades of Eeyore) and his blue song are really hot to the heart. The songs of Joe Raposo are for the most part simply beautiful. Certainly a worthwhile curiosity that will probably (unfortunately) fall in total darkness.
