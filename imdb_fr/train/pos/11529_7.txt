As a biopic, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco has transformed the notorious divorced society Ms. Leslie Carter into a global star) is certainly not in a league with this other Warner biopic a similar vintage, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (but what is it?), but "Lady" is a nice movie in itself - AND shares a lot of common traits with the classic Cagney. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Red-haired Woman" is full of flavors from the traditional show. (Among other things, both films feature delightful theatrical internship sequences as well as the inevitable behind-the-scenes scenes and theatrical directors' offices.) In addition, in "Lady" as in the Cohan biographical film, the cast Secondary is made up of and beloved character actors from this era, all doing the kind of first-rate work for which we remember it. <br /> <br /> Should we add that, again, like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The red-haired woman" does not let the truth stop us from telling a good story? But, like "Dandy", "Lady" succeeds - gloriously! - to convey the essence of the larger-than-life personality of his show giant hero. Everyone knows that Cagney has always held Cohan in his brilliant and affectionate rendition in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few moviegoers realize that Claude Rains performed a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady with Red Hair" - and did it with a panache almost equal to that of Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco captures perfectly the galvanic personality of this legendary showman in all its magnificence. The rains offer an extremely pleasant performance, remarkably observed and remarkably true to reality since this man had been called "The Wizard" by Broadway. Watch Claude Rains in action (look in each shot as if he were having a good time!) In "The Lady with Red Hair", it is David Belasco come alive in the cinema as if he was eager to move the things. again on the main stem. <br /> <br />
