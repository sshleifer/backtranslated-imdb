Maybe I liked this film so much because I felt depressed and it's such a beautiful fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfectly perfect. Great intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, great). This movie made me happier than I was for a while. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and intelligent film. The joke of the kingdom's history about the savagery of the princes and its aftermath, the fact of indulging in magic produced magical effects on the witch and dozens of little intelligent touches that excited me all. This is largely what makes it so good. It's an elaborate movie, loaded with special effects, with more story than most fairy-tale movies, but that gets incredible attention for the little things. <br /> <br /> I feel like going forward and looking at it again.
