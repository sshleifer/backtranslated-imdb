This show has arrived so far. At first, EVERYONE in Eric's cast in Fez, it was all new actors and actresses, new faces, and just look at what they accomplished. They stuck with the show and it was a success. It's one of the best shows ever made and it's probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it finish, but if they finish this series, I hope that the final of the series will be held with one of the biggest bangs of all the finals of the season. I do not care if the whole season is nil because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go swing, hit one last punch. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, that everyone knows that it will end, as on Friends, and that the final will be huge. I ask Donna and Eric to get married, I ask Hyde and Kelso to fight and become friends again. I say there's something interesting going on between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it will not succeed. Just close the BIG TIME GUYS series! <br /> <br /> This 70s show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I'd like you to be friends. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
