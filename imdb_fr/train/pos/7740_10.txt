It is rare that we meet such an irreproachable film. It's really one of the best-played, most structured movies I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, according to each of the three main characters. The film weaves an intrinsic network of motivations and double crosses that capture you and refuse to let you go. Add to that the slow romance between Kevin and Faye is as moving as anything that has ever been about celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect movie. He exposes the romance of films such as "Titanic" as banal clich√©s. If you are looking for a movie to watch while you fold the laundry, that's not it. You have to commit to this movie. You can not have a conversation while you walk in and out of the room. This film requires your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you will benefit a lot. Unless you think that "Titanic" is the greatest movie of all time.
