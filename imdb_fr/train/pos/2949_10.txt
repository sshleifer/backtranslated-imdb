It's the funniest stand I've ever seen and I think it's the funniest I'll ever see. If you do not choke on laughter at the absolute hilarity, it's just not your cup of tea. But honestly, I do not know anyone who saw that who did not like it. It's now 17 years later and my friends and I always quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fool's game, Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man, Ralph and Ed to GET OUT !! There are so many individual and collective hilarity sketches here that if you honestly did not see this movie, you're missing out on one of the best stand-ups of all time. Take any of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even the big names like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and it will surpass it. I do not know how or where Murphy got some of his material, but it works. That's what it comes down to. It's funny like hell. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine how much this show must have shocked people accustomed to Eddie to do Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and others on SNL? If you listen to the public when they start making their first joke or when they say the word F for the first time, they are completely shocked. <br /> <br /> He declares for the first time that the word F is when he does the sketch on MT's homosexuality <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy. Look very cute in their jeans Now come here and f @ ** me in the ass! <br /> <br /> The crowd bursts of laughter. Nobody expected the dirty mouth he let them go. But the results were just great. I have never been the victim of an implacable comedy as I was in this role play. In fact, the next time I had so much stomach pain because I was laughing, it was not until 1999, when I saw SOUTH PARK: GREATER AND NOT CUT. This comedy was raw and without excuse and she was going for jugular, just like DELIRIOUS. I do not think it's possible to look at this piece of comic history without laughing. It's almost twenty years later and it's still the funniest thing on video. <br /> <br /> "I took your kids fishing last week in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes, Gus, normal children do not shit like that Gus. Then they started to move their heads like that and the m **** f ***** gets up with the fish, then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo, I said, can you believe what f **** n shit ?! "<br /> <br /> See it again and get ready to laugh at your fucking ass off! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
