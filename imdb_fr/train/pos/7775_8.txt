Another in the they do not do them like this category. This story of a family with real skeletons in their closet is always described as pure entertainment, sometimes exaggerated. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as brothers and sisters Hadley in trouble, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the support categories, both honors being well deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat bland tracks. Neither Bacall nor Hudson can ever be called bad actors, but they both had better roles and played them much more convincingly than they are here. It's a bit difficult for me to accept that Rock Hudson plays a straight-blooded heterosexual, but it's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that does not detract from the overall entertainment value of the film, which is huge and extremely viewable. If you get up one night and the movie starts, I'd say watch it. It's worth it.
