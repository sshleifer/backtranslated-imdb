Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that touch only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the great LOST story that is told. <br /> <br /> From the special effects game, ROST is the essential TV show for science buffs. -fiction, fantasy, action, adventure and a lot of mystery. <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is so well chosen and so good in their roles, either you like them, or you hate them, or I wish them death outright. <br /> <br /> The visual effects used (which is rare) are in fact fairly well done given the usual production of shows. Whether it's the "smoke monster" for polar bears, LOST is credible in terms of eye candy. <br /> <br /> In terms of history, nothing can be compared to the vast complexity that this show has made viewers like me endure. From end to end, the continuity is almost perfect, the characters develop and the ever-changing story slowly gives answers to his many questions. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is virtually no defect in LOST. That's what Arrested Development did for comedy: it set the bar high. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend LOST to those who are patient, intellectual and who love every moment of the race, no matter how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> See this show.
