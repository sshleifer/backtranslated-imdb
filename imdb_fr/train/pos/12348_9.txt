It helps a lot if you know the culture and the period in which this film takes place. First of all, these women are NOT geisha, they are prostitutes in the Yoshiwara "green houses" around 1860. This should help to clarify some of the details that might be confusing to the ignorant. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love, and, perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversity, theirs, and others in their immediate environment. This, added to the scandalous photography and the music of haunting beauty, makes it a beautiful stroll. Just plug it in, suspend disbelief and enter their world. You will not be disappointed.
