Bellocchio refers to it as a predominantly political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it seems to be more of a metaphor than reality. Well, almost everything in the movie seems to be a metaphor. The revolutionaries, of whom we see and about which we learn very little, could just as easily be Mafiosi. <br /> <br /> Andrea's dad, a psychoanalyst, seems to regard traditional bourgeois values ​​as morally straight, imperturbable, clean and orderly, completely ritualized. <Br /> <br /> Giullia, the girlfriend of a revolutionary, seems to represent what can happen to someone who really needs a cause to support, but who is unable to muster the kind of devotion that 'requires such commitment. (I guess it's here.) Andrea, the teenager, seems to be the only guy in the movie not to be worried in a "disturbing" way. He is respectful of his father but also disobedient. We love Giullia, they say, although he is not yet old enough to learn how to manage his reflexes optimally, but he leaves to go to school and finish his final exams. His journey between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as "media". He is the man between the two, who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can keep his calm while those around him scream. <br /> <br /> Most of this comes down to the oral part of his finale when asked. to translate and comment on an excerpt from Antigone, which opposes the traditional authority of the gods to the notion of secularism and free will. <br /> <br /> This brings us - without any particular course that I know of - to Marushka Detmars. It evokes a caricature New York dating from a few years ago. Two hippos are plunged into the river, watching a gazelle drinking at the bank, and a hippopotamus telling the other, "I hate her." She is a good actress. (Let me say it.) But it's the same for everyone in the movie. She carries with her, in her speech and her manners, the rich spark of total madness. And all that comes from the actress, not from the help to the realization. Detmars is not crazy as Catherine DeNeuve was crazy about "Repulsion". The walls do not become rubbery and do not enlarge the hands. Instead, we see it animated - sometimes TOO animated. And she gives us shocking jolts when her mood changes abruptly and becomes threatening, like a threatening storm. <br /> <br /> A reviewer described it as sensual, but that's probably not the word he was looking for. She is incredibly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair, her wide, ready smile, her impulsive laughter. And his eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of the ancient Egyptian tombs. The sexy parts are rather erotic, not because one of them is explicit, but because we got to know the characters involved. (It's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than to see a skin movie.) In fact, there's NOT just sex. There is only one simulated report scene, but the director lets it play in what appears to be real time. At least in real time for an eighteen year old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea is also very good, which is a necessity, because the film depends almost entirely on him and Giullia. They have to wear it and they do it. Without their performances, I'm not sure this film would be as interesting or as wonderful as it is. It could easily have been turned into a rather slow and boring romance. <br /> <br /> Worth it.
