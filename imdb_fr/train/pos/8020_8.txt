I think this film is the most enjoyable of the Muppets, because I feel it is the lightest film and the best comic for most of his films. The Muppets are trying to go to Broadway to sell an original musical they have written, but along the way they encounter the usual problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. Even if there are not as many big names as in the original film "Muppets Movie", there are in particular Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Just the timing and delivery of so many lines are excellent, and the situations in which the Muppets are hilarious. The original songs are also good here and the end is satisfying. There is not much else to say about the film, but Muppet fans should see it for sure. This is the funniest Muppet movie that will please everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 on ****
