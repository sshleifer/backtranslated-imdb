- SMALL SPOILER HERE! - <br /> <br /> When I watched the votes for "Creep" today, I was surprised to see so many IMDb users rank this movie "1". I wonder: what do people expect from this kind of film? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's a great movie! That means automatically: it has an absurd story full of holes, outrageous dangers and simple characters on one side. So why complain? Just grab some popcorn and coke, sit back in your seat and ... ... take the opportunity to be afraid of dying! The first 60 minutes, when there is almost nothing but Kate and a lonely metro station, are scary. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will be shaking because of the sudden sound of a flashing neon light in the back of you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best job in this movie.) <br /> <br /> When Kate meets her pursuer, the quality of the film falls but it's still not a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not afraid at all, but the gores are well done and the story is quite well developed. (... as long as you keep in mind that this is a horror movie you're watching and not Discovery Channel!) So, if you want to spend a really scary hour. Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and then go out of the cinema or turn on your TV. Anyway, you know the rest of the story, do not you? The villain will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie until the end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to push the anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema by the dark night, go to the next station metro and take the last train back home ...
