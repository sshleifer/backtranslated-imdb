I thought the sentinel was going to be a mediocre film. When I finally saw it, I took a good surprise. The film is not great, but it's very funny and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of TV It looks a lot like this series and it also reminded me of Wolfgang Petersen's thriller, In the line of fire.If you're waiting for one of the most original and greatest thrillers in history you will be disappointed.But if you go there with few expectations, you will appreciate The Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
