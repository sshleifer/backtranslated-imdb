This film has tears in his eyes; John Roberts really touched the hearts of viewers, making this beautiful photo where life is perceived through the mind and heart of Paulie. We discover from time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I just could not stop my tears even though the movie had a happy ending. It's great, after thousands of movies I've seen in my life, "Paulie" touched me deeply. It's after the "ugly duckling", the second photo that really upset me.
