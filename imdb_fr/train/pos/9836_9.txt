Although it's not as scary as its cult predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I like it better. This is due to its faster pace, better settings and cool soundtrack. He is loaded with action and has sweet gore effects of Lucio Fulci. The zombies do not look as bad as in ZOMBI 2 but they still look good. It was quite well done but it really does have its share of cheesiness; For example, some zombies move very slowly while others are as fast as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to the Italian horror? There is even a zombie head flying! How is it rad? Must-see for fans of gorehounds and zombies. it would probably satisfy most fans of action movies. Also check out Zombi 4.
