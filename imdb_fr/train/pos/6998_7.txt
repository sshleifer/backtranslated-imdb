Entering Seven Pounds, I did not really know what to think, because the previews were very difficult to understand what the movie really was. So, in the first 20 minutes or so, you're completely lost in the plot, you have no idea what's going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big jerk. All of this ends when the "twist", so to speak, is erased at the very last minute of the film. Basically, Tim (will smith) was troubled and haunted by a serious accident he caused, ending the lives of seven people. As a result, he decides to discover seven new people who are in dire need of help and to whom he gives his life. <br /> <br /> The action of this film is fantastic, because I feel that it will be forged anyway. a part it seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, for me, is one of his best films, aside from the eagle eye which, I think, is up to par. She did good, but she keeps her promises in this movie. Other actors, such as Woody Harrelson, have a very small role and not important enough to capture the character. Although the cast of the film is always good. <br /> <br /> This film is certainly not what I expected and certainly a much slower pace in which I was hoping. The movie, however, was still very good. Nothing is revealed before the last 5 minutes of the film and everything is set up. Until then, it seemed like a useless love story. Final thought seven pounds = seven stars.
