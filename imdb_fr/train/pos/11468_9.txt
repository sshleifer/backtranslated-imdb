I'm really surprised how few films have been made about the Columbine massacre. There is no major documentary, very confusing. Fortunately, we are honored by the talent of Ben Coccio, director of ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who also produced the very good ELEPHANT. Two different shots of the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there is something disconcerting and incomprehensible about the motivations of the two assassins and what has actually pushed to wear it fantasy actually horrible. ZERO DAY, supposedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event, is absolutely captivating. Even if you know where this is going on, you still hope it will not "go out there" ... and the tension in the last minutes of the film is unsustainable. The film is fantastic from beginning to end, from the director to the script (not much improvisation, even if it seems very spontaneous) to the two main actors, as well as the supporting actors. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that troubles me. Okay, so we can not understand why the shooters would do what they did, but one of the contributors was certainly their anger. Yet these boys do not seem really angry. They can say certain things to indicate that they are, but in fact they did not convince me that they had something in them that forced them to kill innocent people. But that always leaves me with the meaning of "why ???" Coccio, the director, wants me to come. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will invade you and you will stay long. The people of BLAIR WITCH could only wish the success that these guys had to make a fake documentary.
