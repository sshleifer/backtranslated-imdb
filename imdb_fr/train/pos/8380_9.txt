Now, I've always been a fan of Full Moon's puppetry. But I must say that Robot Jox is one of his best projects. Yes, you heard me The story works great, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a great job. Gary Graham, who makes his mark on TV shows such as ALIEN NATION THE SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be a star of action that pulls his ass and takes his name. The effects in stop motion could have been a little better. The color was wrong, they seem plastic instead of the metal they were supposed to be. But it's a minor complaint compared to the whole Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, then you'll like this movie. 9 STARS OUT OF 10.
