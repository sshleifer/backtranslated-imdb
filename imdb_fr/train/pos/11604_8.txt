In the seemingly endless quest for finding well-made and well-executed horror movies, it is very rare to find a film that even approaches far. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon "Burned at the Stake" on an American cable network while returning channels. The premise is relatively simple. In 1692, the young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most eloquent witness against so-called witches. She makes baseless accusations against anyone who gains her dissatisfaction. Reverend Parris (Peters) manipulates it for his own purposes, which also serves as a guide to the court on witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode family of witchcraft. Salem (circa 1980), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before his visit to the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in seventeenth-century costume tries to approach him there and the building. He continues to follow her as strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more. Soon, it seems that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, a more detailed description is rather complicated and would give too much information. Although the film is not action oriented and probably of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the many flashbacks of the film seems very convincing. Production values ​​are strong, with the possible exception of some special effects. In the footnote, the film's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Spectators who enjoy a well-made horror movie, atmospheric, but sober, can appreciate it. Screenwriter / director Bert I. Gordon has had a long career in making sci-fi and horror films. He is best known for his work on a number of "big bug" movies and similar works from years before.
