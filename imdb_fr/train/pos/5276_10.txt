I joined IMDb so people know how good it is! It is not often that you encounter a film that is moving and visually cinematic, while remaining humble. You've read the plot, so all I'm saying is that you do not have to watch it because you want to witness a ruckus of cultural and religious identity, because that's the misconception typical to which people give reading. and sons on a growing journey to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it on before movie4 makes a mistake. It was one of the few films to be nominated for an independent and foreign BAFTA. The beauty of this game is that it manages to seduce anyone, even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used according to the Hollywood formula, but a beautiful story that will keep you busy. The only thing I want is that it's longer and see what happens
