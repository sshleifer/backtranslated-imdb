One of the best films I have ever seen is an Irish film called Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the play before seeing the movie and loving them both. This is the story of a young man who is about to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not make a living in Ireland. This is said both from the point of view of the young man (which the other characters in the film can see) and from another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings, but which can not be seen by the other characters in the film. movie. It's a very sad film, but deeply touching, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to think. I love all Irish films, or almost all films about Ireland, and all the movies in which Irish actor Donal McCann has died get my vote. a pity to have lost it so young.
