The Road Rovers was a big show about the canine superheroes chosen by Master to fight crime around the world. The show was hilarious to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that could please all ages. Throw jokes throughout the series that could give birth to a drinking game. The action was hypnotizing and intelligently organized. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what I liked most was the depth of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but involved in a subtext. Hopefully someday, there will be a way to watch the Rovers in action again.
