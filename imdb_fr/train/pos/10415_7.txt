Three flashbacks present the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and the princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are the songs, each related to these same characters. On three occasions, Ahmad pronounces the absolute word "Time" in his declaration of love to the princess. He answers his three questions at the first of their three meetings. The impression he gives is so strong that the princess will resist Jaffar's three attempts to conquer her - according to three successive stratagems: deception, hypnosis and obliteration of memories. However, Jaffar possesses what he describes as the three essential instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power and the sword. Three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical horse, the Genie, and the Genie and the magic carpet. The Genie offers three wishes to Abu at the first of his three meetings; Three times the genius laughs loudly in the gorges of the mountain, and three others are his thoughts on human frailty, before his departure. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn (armed guards, giant spider and giant octopus). Three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows the future of Abu, the magic carpet that carries him just in time to save Ahmad and the princess and the rainbow to execute Jaffar. There is magic in number three and the movie.
