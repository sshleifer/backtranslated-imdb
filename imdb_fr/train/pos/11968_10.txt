Full House is an excellent show. I'm still growing today. I started looking at him when I was 8 years old and now I'm 12 years old and I'm still looking at him. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. She is my favorite. she had such a sense of humor. In case there are people on this show who would hardly watch the show, you should do it because you are going to get addicted. I became hooked after the first series I saw, which was the first episode, in 2002. It's really a good series. I really think that this show should go down to several generations in families. and it's great too because it's a show suitable for all ages. and for all parents, he teaches children how to continue their lives. nothing terrible happens, like violence or swearing. it's just a very good sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think? Oh, and the best time to look at it is when you're sick at home after school or even the old office. This will make you feel a lot better. Believe me, I'm barely sick at home, but I always know that it will make you feel better. and to anyone who thinks that the series is stupid, well it's too bad for you, because you will not go so far in life, even if you are happy with your life. you should really watch and you will become addicted. I just told you what happened to me and to everyone else who started watching this great show. Well, I have to go to lunch. Remember that you have to start looking in full and soon!
