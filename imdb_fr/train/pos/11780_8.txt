It's a documentary I met by chance on the British television channel More4 and I must say that I found it extremely interesting and provocative. I will also look for the book that was the source of this documentary. Basically, this is the theory of Professor Jared Diamond on why some parts of the societies of the planet have prospered and others not. The argument he presented was new to me and explained how the fortune of good crops and good animals that can be domesticated is certainly convincing. As for the documentary itself, it is well shot and narrated without too many recreated scenes that ruin many modern documentaries. Diamond also helps not to be condescending, which is the fault of many intellectuals who try to get a message to the masses. People have claimed that his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy it and I see it more as a geologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory about the evolution of non-religious society. Highly recommended viewing.
