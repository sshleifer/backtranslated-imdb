A little too long and going to the end, this comedy is a look absolutely charming, never condescending or ridiculous about the problems of a "man of power", who likes to wear women's clothes at night. <br /> <Julie Walters is beautiful as always, but Adrian Pasdar is quite credible and steals the film. He (she) is absolutely beautiful in high heels and silk stockings.
