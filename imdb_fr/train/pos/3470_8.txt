Even though I'm young enough, the Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE band! I never had the chance to hear their music as it was published, but I love them since I remember. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that deserves to be tried once. I can understand why this film was not shown in the cinema, but it's certainly an excellent film to broadcast on television. I was flipping through my TV guide and I happened to see this movie; he did not give much details, except something like "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after the dissolution of the Beatles, Jared Harris Stars". I had never heard of him (he was playing John) or Aiden Quinn playing Paul. However, they are certainly underrated players! <br /> <br /> The film started slowly, but as it developed, I saw how much Quinn, but especially Harris, played their characters well. As a big fan, I know what the real Lennon and McCartney look like. The screenplay was brilliant and Harris focused on Lennon's focus, personality and manners! Quinn played McCartney very well, but sometimes took his Irish accent again. Makeup artists have made them look great. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE COUNTED AS A * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I already mentioned, it started slowly, but soon developed and became quite a emotional film. I found that the piece in the park was a total waste of time and an unusual character for both musicians. As for the coarse line of Lennon in the Italian restaurant, totally useless. The end was very poignant and tears my eye every time I look at it. <br /> <br /> It's very different from the other biographies I've seen, which tells how the Beatles got together and became famous, and those who never really made the characters as well. For example. "Backbeat". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you are a fan of the Beatles, John Lennon or Paul McCartney, let yourself be tempted, you may have a good surprise. After only 95 minutes, it's worth waiting for the film to develop. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really took place, thank you for sending it to the "comments" page of this movie, I would be very interested.
