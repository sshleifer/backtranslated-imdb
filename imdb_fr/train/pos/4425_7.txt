Another attempt by modern Japanese filmmakers to redefine the genre chambara. Success, not to varying degrees. <br /> <br /> A Buddhist monk has the idea of ​​killing a legendary (and very active) demon on the Gojoe Bridge in order to attain enlightenment. Although not in the foreground, Buddhist thought is at the heart of this film, as is Kurosawa's "Ran". This is probably what made the film the most interesting to me though it is now close to the league "Ran". <br /> <br /> The elegant visual direction and the excellent photography keep the film mainly interesting throughout the two hours and eighteen minutes. The main actors are consistently excellent. The music is really good. The two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes. The film hangs in the middle, which could have been corrected by careful editing. And the fight scenes are mostly filmed in close-up blur. It works for most of the movie, but the finale looks like a cheat. Another recent film like this one is Tsui Hark's "Seven Swords", an excellent film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing. Asano does not really move like a demon brandishing a sword, his game is awesome, but he would be an extra in a traditional fighting scene with the chambara. <br /> <br /> A good movie, you will probably find it interesting just do not expect traditional sword fights.
