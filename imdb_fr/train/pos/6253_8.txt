This movie is great. As we often hear, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike other people, I clearly do not think it is depressing, negativist or dismantling Austria as a proto society. -fascist. On the contrary: although there are indeed very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are named after very bad people, you also look at the love, the beauty and the humor in the film Ulrich Seidls. And that's exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that try to show the lives of "ordinary people" in an intense and realistic way; their agitation, their wishes, their dark sides: Seidl clearly does not try to prove that the life of working class people is a junk! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid to admit that almost no one lives live is as "clean" and "normal" as we would like others to believe. And each life has its dark side and often depressing. The most beautiful scene: the old Viennese man, watching his old daughter dance "in the oriental way", as he calls it. I think that everyone who finds this ugly scene lacks beauty and should be wondering what it is: it's a proto-fascist: HUNDSTAGE characters or viewers, who are upset by a woman's body over 70 years dancing with all his charms for his lover.
