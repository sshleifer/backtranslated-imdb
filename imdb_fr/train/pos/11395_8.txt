I took old musicals out of my garage and it's another one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He won two Oscars for best 1951 film and best screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping her, but she quickly discovers that she loves him. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls in love with the pretty lady Leslie Caron. His main dance partner, and I must say they are fantastic together on the ground and elsewhere. The famous French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So, if you like good music and fun scenes filled with Oscar Levant's agile piano fingers, George Gershwyn's songs will remain forever in this colorful jewel. 8/10
