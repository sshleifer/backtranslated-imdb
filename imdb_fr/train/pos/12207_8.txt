After all, you're not going to see a film by Orson Welles to see a nice little simple plot and polish the image of a happy star, after-blow ... ??? <br /> <br /> You will see intensely theatrical characters locked in a conflict with colorful and unusual scenery, imaginatively lit and marked, photographed with courage, and all filled with unexpected details of surprise that a director wiser and duller would avoid or think in the first place ?? <br /> <br /> As usual, in addition to the staging, Welles wrote the screenplay and he also played the hero ?? a young Irish sailor who had hit the world and saw the harm, while maintaining his confidence in the goodness of others ?? Unfortunately for him, he trusted Rita Hayworth, whose beautiful appearance concealed a dark past and deadly leanings for the future. She was married without love, to a helpless and crippled lawyer, and acted like a malicious lizard by the brilliant Everett Sloane ?? <br /> <br /> There is a juvenile romanticism that underlies all of this, and this quality has become an exuberant game in "The Lady of Shanghai". Before the inevitable, Welles escaped? a final triangular confrontation in a room of mirrors, which has become one of the classic scenes of post-war cinema? <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Welles did not fail to counterbalance words and actions with visual details that enriched the texture and enhanced the atmosphere ?? Her camera almost caressed Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs as she played with the tease of the young sailor in his canvas ??
