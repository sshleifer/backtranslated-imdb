Many classic films of the late 1960s have not retained their ability to disturb and confront the public. "In Cold Blood" has not lost an ounce of its power. It is exceptionally well done, but forces the viewer to think. Some have complained not only of the film, but of the "non-fiction novel" of Truman Capote's source, that the central message is not subtle. This may be true, but it is certainly a case where the lack of ambiguity does not detract from the film. It is refreshing, especially considering the simplistic and manipulative moral dramas of today, to see a film with a convinced political voice without fear of forcing the public to take its point of view into account. To be honest, I'm not sure I agree with the central message of the film, but I still admire his daring. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with the anti-capital punishment message, there is much to admire about the film. The game of both leaders is great. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors of all time) is a nihilist leader, using his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also the most docile of the two and the one with a conscience. His character obviously has a voice of reason, but he is terrified of opposing Wilson (there is a good amount of homoerotic subtext from his character). Cinematography is brilliant, elegant and yet grainy and really gives the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic Quincey Jones score and you get a masterpiece. (9/10)
