Old Jane's tale seems very popular these days. I lost count of the number of versions distributed. The reason is probably that its "ruts" are our "ruts" even at this late date. This television mini-series gives him a story adapted to the novel. Emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, even if the atmosphere of Jane Austen's world may seem a little artificial today. If you do not look like EMMA, I'll just say that Emma is getting out of it. It's worth looking to find out how. The honors here go to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have a psychic connection with old Jane!
