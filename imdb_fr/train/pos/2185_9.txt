Poor Basil Rathbone, an egotistical composer who lost his muse. He has been pretending to do so for some time, buying his words and music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby's music) and (words of Mary Martin) meet and fall in love. And then, they find out what they did. Complications ensue, but everything is corrected at the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing in a terrifying way. Mary had signed a contract with Paramount and had also doubled as a regular member of Crosby's Kraft Music Hall radio show. For reasons I do not understand, the audience did not watch it at the movies. She returned to Broadway and made One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy does it very well. His sidekick is constantly deflated by teammate Oscar Levant. Once again, I'm surprised they did not make more movies together. the previous comment on the title's melody being an improvised improvised session in a pawn shop. Good job of all. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and excellent entertainment.
