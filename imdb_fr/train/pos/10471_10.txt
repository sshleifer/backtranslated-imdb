I enjoyed this movie but I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and I have many friends in the music industry ... who are still trying to become adults ... more fans, groupies, money, etc. ... and they have so much trouble adjusting to a normal life ... when they see the new bands, etc., in the spotlight ... it's almost like they have to start from scratch again .. This film shows what a lot of old rockers of the 70's and 80's are going through now .... and that's where I find the film sad and depressing. But it tells the story of an old rock star abandoned and lost. The girl who arrives in her decrepit home reminds me of Hollis Maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is a lady in a movie that you will applaud. This film is a must for people in their fifties who have witnessed the rise and fall of groups, people who knew the members and saw them hurt as the age moved on, and the popularity of It's almost perfect ... .sad but in a positive way ... because of the whales. A MUST SEE!
