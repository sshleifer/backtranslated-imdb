'Holes' was a very good movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I spoke to said they liked it. All the actors were worthy of their role and Shia Labeouf really has a future with the profession of actor. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden, she was exactly as I had imagined. all those who have not seen it, I recommend it and I guarantee you that you will "dig" it.
