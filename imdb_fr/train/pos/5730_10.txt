Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland may be for nobody except Lynch and that's what makes him fun and a collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Impiety? Yes. Absurd? Yes. Trash? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful image of some Americans who do not have brains and who hit women and children for fun. From Mexico I can say that I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth bleed, all the noise and violence makes me want to scream and put me behind my bed. 2- Take the stick! Yeah baby, take it and learn a lesson: some people will never be grateful for your actions. 3- Ants. The most episode of Lynch, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
