Guys and Dolls is a movie that requires a remake. It was manufactured forty-eight years ago. His two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Even if a remake, with big stars now, would be a box office success, he could not capture the magic of this version. Her boundless energy can not be recovered, nor can the sheer joy you get when you watch something like this: a huge, big-screen entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (who last recorded 409 pounds). the last time I heard) plays Sky Masterson, one of the biggest players in New York. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose shit game as often as possible, is at the height of the city. However, when the only place he has to pay $ 1,000, Detroit needs that money quickly. He bets at Masterson, $ 1,000, that he can not take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> Guys and dolls are basically nothing more than unsavory guys who sing and dance, like here, add to the fun. It's obvious how broadly it was a Broadway musical: there were not many sets and the scenes were long. If I had to complain about something, it's how unequal the songs were. Sometimes there were two songs in one scene; at other times thirty minutes have elapsed without one. Guys and dolls are never boring, just a good time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Uncategorized.
