I work in a movie store and, as such, I'm always looking for a great movie. I decided to check Nothing in the Canadian Section, and I try to support the film industry in my country. I was in a surprise. The film starring David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very entertaining story that seems to plunge into so many of our minds and relationships ... without working so hard. He is always comical by the interaction of the two characters, as well as by amusing exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have the cable!"). What else can I say without noticing that it's worth it, even if you give it up in the first half hour.
