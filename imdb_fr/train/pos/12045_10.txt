I saw this film for the first time when I was a child and it's the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on my face and eyes in horror during a particular scene . I remembered this with a dissipation with my friends from the university and I quickly bought it on video with a lot of hesitation that I could add (to my surprise, I only found it on the web in the United States, when it was made in England!). Once again, my reaction was almost the same, to my surprise, horror and fear, and my heart never beat so much. This is in my opinion the SCARIEST movie of all time, Hollywood movies seem tame in comparison and a little pony and trap (shit), excuse the pun. What is amazing is the power of this film and when I look at twenty of my colleagues at university, I've never heard so many shouts, guys too! Even the sight of the video makes me fear God of this particular scene and gives me the feeling that I will never walk alone in the dark !!!!
