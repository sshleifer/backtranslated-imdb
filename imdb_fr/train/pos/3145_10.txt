This show of the 70's is the best TV series of all time. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. This 1970s show continued for 8 seasons, all focused on a group of teens / young adults struggling with relationships, separating from their parents, and their overall future. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers who live side by side. They have lived side by side for most of their lives and are starting to feel more for each other at the beginning of the first season. Much of the series revolves around how their relationship works. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was on duty, so he really pushes Eric. Kitty is the complete opposite. Although she drinks a lot, she treats Eric and her friends very carefully. Bob, their neighbor, is obviously Donna's father. Bob laughs with several different women throughout the series' raw history. Bob also annoys all the power of Red. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play a major role in the history of the series. <br /> <br /> The first season is excellent. It is at this moment that the characters begin to feel new things for each other. The first season is original, fun and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, even if it is not as good as the first. This is a basic continuation of the first. Eric and Donna are together and everything is fine. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He came back and captured the feeling and humor of the first season. I also think that the character's chemistry has improved a band, making the show even more fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not so good. Eric and Donna Arne are not together in this one, which makes the show a little less enjoyable. It's always funny, even if I did not like it as much as the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season of my life. It's the senior year of the gang, so it really helps with the story. The fifth season also had the best end of the season. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is good for most. It's extremely fun, although it does not reflect the feeling of other seasons. The gang is no longer in high school, so I think it did not hit the teenager, but not the previous seasons. I did not like the last three or four episodes either, considering that they had a major drama sensation. <br /> <br /> The seventh season reflects the same feeling as the fifth season, although it does not do it all the way. I enjoyed the seventh season as I did all the others and the end is excellent. <br /> <br /> The last season was totally nil. Eric was not there, which ruined him. Kelso was not there for the most part either, which did not help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good and the show had to end. <br /> <br /> So all in all, if you like comedy, try That 70s Show. They stopped making new episodes, but it's still a lot on television. I also recommend buying seasons 1-7. It's up to you to decide if you want to buy Season 8.
