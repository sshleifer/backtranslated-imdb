I loved the episode, but it seems to me that there should have been talk about the secretary being punished for being an accomplice after the fact. Although I like when an episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, with the discovery of the murderer. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point, Gordon, portrayed by a famous writer, said he was flattered by the famous Lieutenant Columbo, referring tongue-in-cheek to the real-life celebrity of the detective as a crime resolver. This is one of the best among many outstanding payments from Columbo.
