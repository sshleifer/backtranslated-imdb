Let me come to the fore: I have three children aged 5 to 10 years old. I consider a trip to the theater a success when there is no talking animal. I have seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie will be reversed in The Wizard of Oz, the 18-year-old's sexual joke at El Dorado and the tragic break with the end of Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer. I could probably also script Nemo from memory. <br /> <br /> What makes me support one of my children (it varies) who offers this title for the family film of a party? In one word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
