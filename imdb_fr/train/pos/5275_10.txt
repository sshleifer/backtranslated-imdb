This movie is great! This film is beautiful! Finally, a movie describing Muslims as people, no stereotypes here. This film is animated by the narrative, by the actors' play and especially by its theme, that of cultural affirmation and discovery. They may seem like clich√©s but they are not, at least not in this movie. The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely extraordinary and the public has the right to see a side of the Muslim world that is rarely shown in the West. Here, people are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and dedicated to each other. What an expected and well-awaited departure from the usual negative representations of the Arabs. Exceptional movie.
