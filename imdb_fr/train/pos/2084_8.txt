My main problem with the movie is that it takes too long. Other than that, it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays the role of a poor Chinese peasant on the verge of getting married through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a maid who marries Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm and they go very badly. When he finally has money to buy more land, drought strikes and nothing develops. Everyone starts to lead Muni to the north. When they leave and arrive in the city, they realize that they have no job and that they are worse off than before. They even think of selling their youngest daughter as a slave for money but decide not to do it. When a group of people starts looting the city, the army comes forward and executes people. Paul Muni did a good job and Luise Rainer won a second Oscar for this film.
