This film documents a transformational experience for a group of young men and the experience of looking at it is in itself a transformation for the viewer. Few films even aspire to this level of transcendence, and I can not think of any other film - documentary or dramatic - that achieves it. There is no other film in which I laughed so much and cried so much. Yes, it's DMD and accessible travel; just on these issues, it's worth it, but it's more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, living every day in life. And it's an exciting story, fun and adventurous. That's why God created the cinema! See this movie !!!
