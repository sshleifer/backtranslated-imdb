Forget about the "religious" country movies that have monopolized the TV / movie market ... this movie really has a sensation. Although this film can be considered as a cheap emotional film, it also includes this message of forgiveness and good morals. However, I did not like the lighting of this film ... for a film dealing with such subjects, it was too bright. I thought it would take away all the appeal of the film, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast and their performance thwart this forgetfulness. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing ... buy the DVD.
