The critics are stupid. This film is funny and intelligent. I really enjoyed this film. Why does everyone hate this movie so much? I wish people would like this movie more than they do not. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and they worked hard to make this movie. I do not see you making movies like them. So people should just watch it and not comment on it. I like this film. It's OK through all that. There are parts where he became silly but at least they did it. Jerry Stiller would love that because this movie has the same role as the King Of Queens series. But it's better than that. I can not believe this has been rated so low.
