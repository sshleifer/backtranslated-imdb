I saw this film at least fifty times and, after seeing it last week for the first time in a long time, I still felt it. <br /> <br /> The story itself was amazing but was made alive by Spielberg's know-how and fabulous actors, including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for his short but powerful Nettie portrayal. <br /> <br /> You will experience all human emotions while watching this movie. I laughed, cried and got upset. Like most great movies, it has been reviewed by the Academy with a host of nominations, but no wins. But this film is without a doubt one of the best movies of all time.
