I saw this last week on SBS TV here in Australia, where it was titled "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I had activated the subtitles and I think that SBS provided theirs, which, as usual, was of very good quality. <br /> <br /> Just look at "Laputa" on Wikipedia and it confirms what I suspected ... The floating island of this story is from Jonathan Swift's classic novel entitled "Gulliver's Travels", published between the early and mid-1700s. <br /> <br /> speak voice distribution. I think it suits young children, but it lasts a little over two hours, so it may be too long for some, but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story concerns two people. children looking to find a legendary floating island on which is a castle. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They also have pirates, army and spies seeking the island, and seek to capture the children (Sheeta, the daughter, voiced by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, voiced by James Van Der Beek) in order to help them to find The graphics are beautiful ... a kind of photo-realistic sometimes, especially the work scenes of stone lit by the light of a torch, or the pretty scenes of sunny days, with clouds whites, or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
