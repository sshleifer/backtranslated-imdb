As I watched this movie on video last night, I continued to have that tingling that told me it would last. I feel like I will look at this again and again for years. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story / movie. And even if some cultural references are obscure to me, a western viewer is basically a universal tale.
