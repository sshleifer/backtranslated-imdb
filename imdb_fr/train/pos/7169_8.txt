Typically, children's movies have an annoying quality that makes them far too heavy and unbearable for someone over 13 years old. But again, that's before Holes enters the scene. Of course, it has the same moments that often give a children's movie the aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of avoiding such conventions. The acting was decent, and the difficult dynamics Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than most movies are trying to describe. What I particularly liked in this film is the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a bit more natural than most people would imagine, much like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar, redemptive end). The only drawback? The hokey lizards. Overall, however, an 8/10.
