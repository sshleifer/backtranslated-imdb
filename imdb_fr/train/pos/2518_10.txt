This is, by all categories, the best movie I have ever seen. Forget about Hollywood - their movies are always worthless - it's art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who hates what he has become and lives in denial. His final wish for death leads him to Mallepa, home to refugees from several Asian countries. There he meets Sho, an orphan living on the street. <br /> <br /> From there, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the film. He has everything; you laugh, you cry, you become furious, excited, sad, happy ... Never has a film touched me like this movie does. And the actors are incredible - I have never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without sounding strange. A great eulogy to the editor for the creation of this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> One last comment on this brilliant film is that it is interpreted by Gackt (ex-singer of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (singer of L'Arc ~ en ~ ciel) in excellent roles like Sho and Kei. I am amazed how Gackt can change the way he speaks and acts according to his age. <br /> <br /> It's a must. If you never see a movie, go to Moon Child, Raven (Brandon Lee) and the newly released masterpiece, Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. All in their original language, of course!
