Like most people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV and I think he's great. But I did not know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is just "mah" creepy like the other despised woman. Good music, intrigue and a death scene involving Amanda's revenge against an abusive doctor who will stay with you for weeks. I will leave it there. Glory.
