Well, this movie was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh, and the role play, well, let's say it's not gibson melody. But Gary Browning who plays a policeman is so bad he gets good. I do not know how but he himself makes this movie a 10. You have to see it if your horror / slash movies provoke him at the same time. Killer movie.
