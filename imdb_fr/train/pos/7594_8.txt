I do not know the stars or modern Chinese music for teenagers - but I know a completely entertaining movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is a pure Hollywood in his values ​​- he is played to laugh. for love, it's a great mix of kung fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to have had a lot of fun doing it - the production values ​​are excellent - and modern China has a brighter appearance than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The plot of an abandoned orphan who grew up in a kung fu school was hunted only to discover celebrity as a part of basketball (and love, etc.) is great. fun and immensely entertaining. <br /> <br /> It is with great action and a good dialogue that it is a pleasure for all - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best movies for the family we have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - we were really happy to have done so - a GOOD sports humor movie.
