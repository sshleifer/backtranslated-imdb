The only reason I wanted to see this was Orlando Orlando. In simple terms, the film was spectacularly average. It's not bad, but it's really not very good. The editing is good; the film is well paced. Management is competent and assured. The story is heavy. Ledger, Bloom and the normally tall Watts and Rush usually play the movie. The accents are impenetrable if you come from the United States, so settle in and enjoy the scenery (or as I call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film, I did not get bored or moved. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. I must say that I did not care at this point. <br /> <br /> Really, the only reason I can recommend this is that Orlando Bloom somehow hints at the scope (although this "I'm pretty and confused" is predominant) So the fangirls can find it worth the price of the morning. Apart from that, do not see it. It's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining.
