Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third, and most directed, short film has a quirky sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads. The film is at the heart of what he has at heart and it is certainly how an ordinary Joe finds the confidence to cross life with a little inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The short film makes intermittent rounds on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes open and hang in there if you can - you'll be glad you did. It's hilarious. And check out Todd's other short films that appear here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
