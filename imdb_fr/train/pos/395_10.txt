Visually stunning and full of oriental philosophy, this amazing fantasy of martial arts is presented to you by master director Tsui Hark, the man behind the best films produced by Hong Kong cinema. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a little cerebral, but is a refreshing change from the movies that treat their audience as if they were a jerk. If it's not your thought, it may not be your movie. Maybe you should check out the latest news from the Hollywood studio's no brain club, but if you're looking for something more, it's where you'll find it.
