Verhoeven's film was a complete waste. He is a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read two chapters of the book, became bored and decided to reconstruct everything. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would NEVER have supported this bin if he had been alive to see it. he. It basically steals the name, mocks the politics of the book (which makes it a good part) and adds T & A so that the average American movie buff does not get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is not perfect, but at least mostly accurate, at best.
