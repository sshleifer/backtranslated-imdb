While Alan Rudolph's "Breakfast of Champions" slips into the theaters with little fanfare and much mockery, it reminds me of 1996, when Keith Gordon's "Mother Night" came out. Now, despite all that is said of Kurt Vonnegut as being "infilmable", it is surprising that he received two superb cinematic treatments (the second being "Slaughter-house Five"). "Mother Night" is certainly one of the most underrated movies of the decade and I do not understand why. It's brilliant! It remains almost entirely faithful to Vonnegut's book (without being scaffolded or too literary) and adds to this a purely cinematographic poetry. How many movie adaptations of an author can claim this? Vonnegut himself even makes an appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better support than this one? It is not only a beautiful film, but also a beautifully interpreted, written and directed film, which is part of my choice for the top five of the greatest American movies of the 1990s. It is a dismal masterpiece, inspired and surrealist who does not deserve to be neglected. I sincerely encourage everyone to attend "Mother's Night" - you do not even need to know about Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as sometimes does "Slaughter-house Five"). It is a powerful and touching film.
