This is your classic 1930s musical, with a big advantage: it features well-known actors from the '30s in fun little cameos. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the story and basically the film is everything. about its fun and carefree atmosphere, with a touch of typical Hal Roach comedy. Apparently, it's a "Cinderella story," but I certainly did not think of it that way when I watched the movie. The story is very confusing in the story, which features many different characters and many appearances of small cameos, when the main characters arrive in Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy makes his appearance and shows some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short film for free. In addition, Walter Long, regular Laurel & Hardy, made an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as director of the short film. <br /> <br /> It is certainly true that all cameos and subplots disturb the main plot and the character but in this case it is not a problem because it is more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot and the typical shallow main character. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly no worse than any of its other genre films of the same period, although the ranking suggests the opposite. <br /> <br /> 7/10
