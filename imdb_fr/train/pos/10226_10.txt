I was about 7 years old when I first saw this movie. It was not so special then, but a few years later, I saw it again and at that moment, it amused me a lot :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the film are: Yeti's body language and "special effects" as well. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for a blockbuster made in Hollywood, even this movie was made from approx. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy.Version video and video (but I do not think it has already been shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> See it , enjoy it !!! Yeti forever !!!
