Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers especially because of money problems. He is crazy to have his own house and his own rules, since his brothers have always stolen his money saved and his parents neglected his wishes. One terrible day, Preston was riding a bicycle; It was the same day that the villain in the story, Quigley, was trying to evade the police and accidentally passed the car on Preston's bike. Quigley needs a check to cover the damage caused by Preston's bike. The problem was: it was a blank check! Preston is a smart boy and decides to have a high price on this check: $ 1 million! All this money gives Preston things he has always wanted, like a mansion with a pool, lots of toys and even a limousine! The problems begin to arise when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, putting Preston in a difficult situation and facing many problems. <br /> <br /> This film was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
