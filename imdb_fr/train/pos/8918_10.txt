No hidden agenda Pure scifi. All the pleasure. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and I was very scared. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> The original can be enjoyed more than the new one I saw and forgot. The original version, featuring movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the best and only version anyone should see. <br /> <br /> The production of the film is dated, but the fx used to make Blob is time-tested. I was convinced that this thing was evolving on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
