Immediately after the Second World War, well-meaning minds in Hollywood tried to stand out from the blind agitation of the flag, the natural ingredient of a war effort. "The best years of our lives" and even the "Gentleman's Agreement" looked at how the Americans saw each other in the aftermath of the war, but Delmer Daves' "The Pride of the Marines" beat them. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of John Garfield, a clever man from Philadelphia, who goes to war as a navy and after a nightmarish night in a fox hole, with Japanese soldiers shouting on he and his friends: "Mariiines, tonight you die!" He is blinded by a hand grenade and sends his girlfriend home rather than depend on her after returning home. <br /> <br /> Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his description of these brave men, almost by coincidence They are there, in the fox's hole, and when they are shot, they react. Too bad for heroism, but they do the job. And then comes the pity of oneself, the sense of humor dark and dark. Garfield is in a denial of anger. of his blindness and the film makes no excuse: "There is no free candy for anyone in this world", as his friend says. A guy, a Jew, played by Dane Clark, reminds him: "In a war, someone gets it, and you are." Everyone has problems! When I get back, some guys will not hire me because my name is Diamond. "<br /> <br /> Great movies are made with guts like these, and if the first half hour of" Pride of the Marines "fails to fully seize the opportunity, it is now evolving into a real work of art You cry and think, you hurt and you hope against all hope Well, simply: art <br /> <br />
