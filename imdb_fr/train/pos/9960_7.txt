I noticed that this film was being shredded long before it was released in cinemas, and I too did not have high hopes. I thought it was another type of movie "You Got Served" with pretty dance moves and a horrible acting game. I was at the theater and chose between that and Meet the Spartans and chose this. To my surprise, the acting was not bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. The fact that he has a lower score than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage posted here, I recommend you go see a morning screening of this film so you do not spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how much everyone was wrong. When it comes to dance movies, it's certainly one of the best movies with much more acting than many others. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. Let's hope the rating will increase after it's out on DVD and more people will watch the movie instead of judging it based on comments before the release of the movie. <br /> <br /> edit The film is now closer to its correct rating. More than 1000 people gave it a score of 9, a bit too much, but at least it helps to make up for the ridiculous votes of 1.
