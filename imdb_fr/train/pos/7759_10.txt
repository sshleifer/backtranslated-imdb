On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a dark, lustrous soap opera about the sexual dysfunction of a Texas oil family. But below all this, there is a deep social commentary on life in the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk marks again with another Univeral bubbler. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson, loves him too. When Stack discovers he is infertile and Bacall becomes pregnant, the fireworks sound. And the all too beautiful Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrayal of the biggest nympho in Texas, which is avoided by Hudson. Good epic soap opera.
