The Americans were the best and for that, I show you my devotion with this film. There are words to describe the perfection of this film. all of a sudden my heart sings, what makes the sunset? I fall in love with easily, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the largest without reservation. if you do not know that your eyes are not open my friends, you must see and appreciate it ... wake up!
