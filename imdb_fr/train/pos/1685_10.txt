He saw this film for the first time around 1990 and died absolutely laughing. He became a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we would quote one by one ("I'm going home in a bag!"). Needless to say, humor is still there, 15 years later. It has become a Halloween tradition to expose many of my new friends to this movie (thankfully you can still buy it on Ebay!). this film provides everything: pathos, suspense, unrequited love, nobility and the list is long. Royal Dano offers an incredible sincere performance as an Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who had a bad ending. Here, we really feel the old man from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will lack levels of humor in this movie. The creators have been very subtle in many ways with flippant comments, a little disguise of subtle costumes in other sci-fi movies and even a scene from the pages of Wile E. Coyote! a lot of thinking process trying to analyze a movie, people - it's a fun rate without the need to spit, and should not shock anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know that we make fun of them ...). <br /> <br /> -Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go get a bar 'Zag-nut' .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, DJ karaoke / artist
