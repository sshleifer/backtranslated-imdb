Love is overwhelming ... In all its manifestations ... Beautiful, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story about love in all its forms, a story about indecipherable ways young hearts, on life and lost innocence, all led by Tudor Giurgiu's clever eye. With a beautiful soundtrack of Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, it surprises at any point, leaving behind the bitter taste of misunderstood love ... Really remarkable ... Is it me or the Romanian cinematography advance-t she slowly but surely and earns respect? It's a brilliant film ... Congratulations to everyone involved.
