Japan has serious problems. The demons infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will. On top of that, the rebirth of Ashura, the queen of demons, is near. The only thing that resists this serious threat is that of Demon Guards, a formidable group of warriors, who could be as bad as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired demon guardian, who is five years old, took the theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing an innocent child (In a battle that strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn). One night, by chance, he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman, Tsubaki. Their fortunes are intertwined (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy / swordplay epic, you would be wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical of Ashura. It's a mishmash of different kinds of movies. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, a drama and a romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles with respect (although comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but really funny movie. <br /> <br /> defects in the film. Some of the humor seems artificial and misplaced. And the acting is not the best. But seriously, do you watch Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movies for great performances? No, we're looking at them to see the action and the beautiful computer-generated images that Ashura has all in Spades. In order not to mislead, the film is not just action, but it is fairly generously spaced with lots of swords and buckets of green blood to please the average viewer. <br /> <br /> Final result; the film has its flaws and is not an epic martial arts, but it does not try to be and presents interesting visuals and a good swordplay action. The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and that if the viewer does the same, he's sure he'll be thrilled with this fantastic and silly sword action movie. swordplay. <br /> My 7 ranking on Fun Popcorn Movie.
