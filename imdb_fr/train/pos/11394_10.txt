Although the story is sweet, and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film is a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It combines the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin), the engaging beauty of French impressionist art, Kelly's exciting choreography (including her delightful "no two love", a genre apart), with the most beautiful color palette ever designed for the whole. Matching the burgeoning music and visual explosion to these dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.
