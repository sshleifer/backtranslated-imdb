It's an extremely long film, which means you can get bored before it becomes interesting, but its length gives its characters the opportunity to find a permanent attachment between your sympathies. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by guilt you will find it particularly heartbreaking because it is a story that finds its heroes among the weak and the wicked. If you can love a monster, you will cry for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone - including his country, his friends and his family - a man also manipulated and shaped since his childhood by these same people. <br /> <There is not a really nice character in all history, not a loyal, "moral" personality with whom to sympathize. But to look at everything without the help of a tissue is quite remarkable. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it at the end. It is well worth it for people who like incentive films about the lowest human character.
