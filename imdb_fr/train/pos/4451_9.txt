The story is simple: an old man who lives alone in the woods accidentally falls on the murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder took place. Although very few dialogues are provided throughout the film, the visual narration told by the single eye of the camera made the film very appealing. The decoration of the gray woods gives off an impression of loneliness which completes the calm of the characters. We may also feel helpless in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which is comparable to the child's inability to silence telling his or her own story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. . This film successfully approaches these elements only through visual elements, instead of relying on inexpensive sound effects or blood and blood that other bad horror movies use when the story is weak. <br /> <br /> Smartly, the story unfolds slowly. to create tension for a few frightening and surprising moments. The end is also unexpected and believable. This film is reminiscent of Japanese horror films, such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water", or English horror movies, such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents". This film offers viewers a real experience of atmospheric horror. I recommend to anyone who likes to fear the chills to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the movies I just mentioned above, try to try them. To try too.
