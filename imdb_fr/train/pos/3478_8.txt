It was actually my favorite Scooby Doo series when I was younger. I thought that each episode had more than one advantage and that the villains had a lot of creative thinking (and even very scary and credible). Some of the best episodes were "I left my neck in San Francisco", "Twenty thousand screams under the sea", "The ghoul, the bat and the ugly" and "When you want a star creature". If you've never seen these episodes, do it. This series was a little mixed, because there were other episodes that did not seem to have the same kind of advantage, like "Rocky Mountain YIIII!". and "Scooby Chief's Ransom". As in the previous series, he was very well prepared, an interesting and brilliantly drawn scenario. As everyone says, it would have been so much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tiring and distracting for the story that was being told.
