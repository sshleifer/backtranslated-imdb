Someone has already mentioned "being at the right time in the right place". It was so true for this documentary that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes and I thought it might include a bit of play but that's not the case. It's all real. The story is not new to people in developing and / or poor countries. It highlights the manipulation of the people by the mainstream media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tensions in the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, the intelligence services or even the government (many who think the United States) use agents who attack "any" camp to provoke the masses into violence and thus justify their blows. A naval officer in the film also mentions it. That they wanted to see people fighting in the streets. All of these scenarios were played in Turkey (United States Pet Dog in the Middle East) which has experienced 3 coups throughout its history. Recently, secret plans developed by the Turkish military were exposed, ironically through pro-government religious / conservative media. opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very large army is bombarded by an army officer to provoke people, etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this film unique is that they filmed from within, perhaps by chance, when the events happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. Whether or not it caused administrators to filter and manipulate events and information, I would not know. <br /> <br /> And if Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of the United States and the world economy without The story will tell us by repressing all opposing thoughts with force and ultimately, becoming a compliant tyrant, <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is a hope and I think it's worth a try.
