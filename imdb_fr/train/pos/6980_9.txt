I must admit that I was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this program before any information was released on it. I decided it would be an economic spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the Retcon wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The driver leaves an excellent impression on the viewers. Accessibility is wonderful! Of course, experienced BSG veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, centered on the development of the Cylons before the First World War. (58 years before BSG pilot events). The pilot also allows newcomers to clearly present his plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled: "Caprica" ​​is not a GSO. We are presented with an immersive and cerebral drama dotted with provocative, audacious and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> The cast meets the standards of BSG; Stoltz and Morales are simply amazing. The portrait of Joseph Adama by Morales, inspired by the portrait of William by Olmos, gives a magnificent glimpse of William's heroic father. Dr. Graystone's portrayal by Stoltz raises many reflections and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot project is an indication of what's yet to come, RDM and its creative team will continue BSG's legacy decorate TV programming with another masterfully televised masterpiece created.
