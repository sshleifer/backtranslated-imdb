This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully played by all players. This will make you laugh and make you cry. The very end of the film makes me fog each time. If you want to see a good movie, that's it. Jimmy Stewert delivers a wonderfully spiritual performance and Frank Morgan plays Mr. Matuschek. The diversity of Morgan's characters is simply incredible. William Tracy, as Pepi, is a fantastic comic relief and delivers some of the most important lines and performances of the film. Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a boiling shop assistant whose ambition is to please those with whom he works. It's a simple story of the closeness of co-workers and the way in which two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love with exceptional circumstances.
