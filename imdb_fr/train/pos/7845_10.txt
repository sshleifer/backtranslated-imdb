So Fox fired the fifth in the middle of a drama / mystery ... <br /> <br /> How is this lame? Do they expect us to invest our time in new programming when there is a realistic risk of never knowing what is happening? Why were the last episodes already filmed not broadcast in the United States? They have been distributed elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Do you listen? It was a great show, but you let us hang. If you introduce new dramas / mysteries, state at least one conclusion before ending abruptly at mid-theme. Whenever something like this happens (and it seems like it happens often with you - that is, Fox), there are more who will "wait" before investing their time. This means that you will see an artificially low interest share and that you are more likely to end the series. See? It's a vicious circle. Do not let us down yet ...
