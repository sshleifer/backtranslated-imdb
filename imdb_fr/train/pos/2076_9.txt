The Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone must see ... It is heartbreaking and very comforting. It is about strengthening the formation of values ​​on perseverance, humility and the love of the family ... History can be related to our present life, especially since poverty is at the threshold. The way we respond to such a problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to deal with such a situation, it can be left defenseless and useless. I am very happy with the way the characters have justified their roles, even the young actors ... Their emotions captivated the audience. The film may have been shot in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you do not want to finish. This makes it really great! There should be a re-make for this very beautiful movie.
