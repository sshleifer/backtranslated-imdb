It is a long-lost horror jewel with Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to find a copy of this film but it's worth it. This film is both scary and old-fashioned. It appears that three young women in the press (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) are going to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover a festival when confusion breaks out between their hotel room and they seek refuge with Earnest. Keller (Lassick). and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling sick while the other two are going to film their story. She is soon murdered at home, in a VERY foamy manner by an unknown force hidden in the ventilation system (she is beheaded by the cover of the ventilation which closes on her when she collapses while she is pulled in the basement). Soon, Karen comes back and is murdered even more brutally by passing her face through the ventilation flap. Jennifer fights with her (ex?) Lover in a rather boring plot and when she gets home, her hosts (whom we have discovered now are brother and sister and whatever is in the basement, it's their son) a plot to try to murder him too. Virgina does not totally agree with Jennifer's plan to Earnest's murder, but she is led to go to the basement where she meets Junior. Here, the film becomes almost comical, because Junior (described hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a mentally deformed and mentally deficient human, whose actions and movements will cause some laughter, even if it is supposed to be scary. This is where the rhythm of the film accelerates and the end is well done. The actors / actresses do a fantastic job with the material, including Lassick, Furst and Bach. Although it is not the most horrible film ever shot, it is very entertaining!
