<br /> <br /> I must admit that I enjoy bad movies. I love them, I look at them all. Horror especially. After a hard week of school and work, my friends and I all gather to rent crazy tunes, order a pizza and have some fun. One of those we got at Hollywood Video was this one, Zombie Bloodbath. This one had a great box, so I was expecting less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project built over a nuclear facility whose aerial layers have been bulldozed, and the other the underground layers are simply covered. Residents of this neighborhood find the facilities covered when children fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up zombies. <br /> <br /> From that moment, it's chunk-city. The gore effects and the action never stop until the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not great art, but this one, with its dialogue in the joke and its macabre stuff, was our favorite among the evening. In fact, it was one of the best "evening bands" that I had the pleasure of watching. And you can say that it was not done with a lot of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it's just a wild trip.
