I remember seeing him at a movie theater in Salem (where I went almost every Saturday at "Kiddie Morning") in Dayton, Ohio, when I was still a boy and I never forgot it. It just surprised me and my friends. I wish I could see him again! I tried to find a compilation of short films or something in vain. It is only recently that I discovered that it was a film of Cousteau and it dazzled me even more. The way he accomplished this is beyond comprehension. The fish is actually in the cat's mouth at some point, if I remember correctly! If anyone could help me find a way to see him again, I would be extremely grateful!
