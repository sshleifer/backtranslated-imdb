I totally disagree with the other critics.All basically negative.I took a chance on this movie and was happy that I did it.Glad indeed.I found nothing wrong with that.No period .The script is original.The actors are all friendly and convincing.Dee Smart reminded me Marcia Brady of Brady Bunch.But this girl can really act.The frame in the Australian Outback is perfect. also here.I saw this film twice in less than 24 hours. I will probably look at it again.It is also interesting.It makes think.It is (was) probably better than nine tenths of Hollywood blockbuster movies. Back Of Beyond is a nice movie.Well photographed.I did not find anything wrong with that.Check it out! My first criticism!
