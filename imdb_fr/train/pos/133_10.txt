A few years ago, a friend received a video from one of his friends with the movie "Heat" by Michael Mann. After we finished this film and we were about to get up, we saw that there was another movie right after. The owner did not write on the casing of the cassette. Yet we were all stuck to our seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, I sat there wondering: how could I not have heard of this masterpiece before? .. <br /> <br /> This film was Europa. Lars von Trier woke up the dark film of death, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious settings, but there was often a haunting similarity to the post-war German photographs I saw. And then the delicate cuts! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a difficult moral odyssey that has no happy ending. A young American pacifist of German origin goes to post-war Germany, anxious to pay a little to pay for the bombs dropped by his compatriots. But above all, it faces mistrust and self-defeating challenge. He hires with Zentropa, a car restoration company (based on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazis employees of lime occupants. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who will later prove to be a member of the terrorist group Werewolf, a post-war Nazi. When he no longer understands the world (or just the Europeans), in his anger, he blows up a railway bridge under a train he has just saved. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, for the historical correction, in The real world, the werewolf was nowhere as important as the film implies, it was mostly a propaganda coup d'etat Nazi. After the assassination of the mayor of Aachen occupied by the police, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of entire legions of saboteurs and terrorists ready to fight behind the lines, the werewolf . Only a few hundred young people, mainly young people from Hitler, have received training. Two or three times they were deployed to kill alleged communists or forced foreigners in Bavarian villages in order to sow lasting fear among the inhabitants, with the death of Hitler and the end of the war collapsed. <br /> <br /> However, werewolves' propaganda has had a profound effect on the occupants. They feared the werewolf everywhere, suspected him behind any serious accident - but without exception, another cause was discovered later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when a gas pipe exploded in the police headquarters in Bremen, bombed, or when the commander of the Soviet army died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was the strongest on the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands of people (mostly children!), Suspected of being a werewolf, and locked them up in prison camps where many of them are dead.
