Narratives ?? Whether written epics, visual or poetic ?? usually try to avoid characters too; After all, readers and viewers can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to find out who is who. This is especially true in the film, I think, simply because we can not easily go back to refresh our memory in a movie theater. Viewers, like me, do not have this problem, however, because we see all our films on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago, Audrey Tautou, a French actress I saw for the first time, was introduced to The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain (2001) and, later, to A Very Long Engagement (2004), two refined and complex stories, composed of many characters. This earlier offer outperforms the others in both directions: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Now, other directors already used these techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same thing with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy with almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is that, on the one hand, the director lets us "see" in the heads of certain characters and, on the other hand, certain scenes are repeated in order to refresh the viewer's memory as the story unfolds. switch between different periods. <Br /> <br /> The base ?? the core, so to speak ?? The story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou), to whom a train colleague takes the train, tells her that she will meet her true love that day. This happens in the first few minutes of the movie. Ironically, Irene does not realize that the young man opposite (Gilbert Robin) is perhaps this "true love". And he does not do it either ... <br /> <br /> They separate without realizing the potential importance of their close encounter. However, chaos persists throughout the day, not only for the two youngsters, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet ... <br> /> <br /> If the story was simple, it might be boring and predictable enough. Not so. The scenario and the director meet our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are too commonplace, but which turn into credible extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. For example, the next time that feces of sky birds fall on a book or one of your papers, think about your alternatives. two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again. Or how about a burst of stone on your windshield? Think again about what would happen. <br /> <br /> All this is pretty interesting. What was more interesting for me was to evaluate every new man who came in and try to decide if it was THE ONE ONE for Irene or if it was the young man on the train. That let me guess for a moment. <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about that, if you see that delicious boil. <br /> <br /> Recommended for all.
