After hearing quite positive reviews and seeing the trailer, I had to see this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell, it had to be good. And it's delivered. Overall, the film is not funny, but there is a scene that really stands out and which, in my eyes, is a classic. SPOILER In the end, they cross the wall to get to the safe and we see that Rockwell and Washington fix Jeter is just fantastic. It's just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude uses a chair to barricade his door, but forgets that the door is turning to the outside! END OF THE SPOILER Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
