This film, with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite Pabst films and I liked them more than his much more famous films, performed by Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). This is probably because both are very similar to neo-realist films that Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film advocated using non-actors (typical people) in every day to create extremely complex and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners. appropriately, people in roles look like minors - not actors. The central conflict at the beginning of the film is that there is a huge mine on the Franco-German border. Instead of a large mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, while unemployment is higher in Germany. This, the differences in language (beautifully illustrated in a dance hall scene) and the First World War conspire to create a huge gap between the factions - resulting in a WE vs mentality. THEY. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit down and do nothing. Risking their lives, they prove that there is a real camaraderie between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film strongly criticizes xenophobia and tried, unsuccessfully, to convince the German public of the futility of war and hatred. It was a wonderfully moving film with some of the scariest and most claustrophobic pictures I have ever seen. Given the story, the impact of the film was, at best, minimal. It's a shame, because as in this one, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET OF THE FRONT FRONT (Milestone) had excellent messages of peace and harmony, but were ultimately failures to influence positively public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it is an incredible and sad relic that deserves to be visited.
