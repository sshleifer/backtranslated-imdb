My friend and I thought this movie was well done. We were expecting a light comedy but we had a full action movie with comics. We both thought the movie might not have been so successful at the box office that previews made us think it was a comedy. I was impressed by the supporting actors and of course, Dave Morse has always done a fantastic job. Most of the actors are veterans and not beginners and they were solid. We both felt that writing and directing were top quality and we commented on the purchase of this film. If you do not buy, rent it to have a good time.
