I watched that night with low expectations. The reasons being, I do not usually like movies "made for television" and I have rarely liked the "casting meeting" movies. But the Los Angeles Times critic seemed to like that, so I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did it. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward meet as themselves. But, in a sense, they acted like their "Batman and Robin". They were campers and did not take themselves, or this movie too seriously. The film begins with the search for the Batmobile designed by "George Barris", which someone stole before being auctioned for an orphan's house. Although they are looking for the car, they also evoke the series they made together. This is said in flashback. It was well done. The actors they got, for the youngest Burt Ward and Adam West, were dead. And, for a TV movie, the actual on-screen and off-screen behavior has been clarified. I give this one a 9/10, I loved it so much.
