Raic Walsh's energetic classic from 1933, The Bowery associates the owner and operator of the hall, Wallace Beery, to his rival and fierce dandy, George Raft. We do not know exactly what rivalry is, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. A lot of sarcasm at first, but the characters soften as the film progresses. Apart from that, there is the pure exuberance of the scenes in Beery's salon. The different characters, the line of sexy chorus, a lot of drinking, a perfect creation of a den of inequity not too restrained by alleged pre-code restrictions, then come Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation itself. All of this creates a very vivid image of a life that has long since disappeared. I do not like comparing times, but this film is completely different from anything we could see today. The film has a lot of heart and innocence lost for a long time and is absolutely must see.
