"Dressed to Kill" is Brian DePalma's best film. It's a ride of suspense, a sense of humor and a style that is unrivaled today. DePalma has a crush on Hollywood, most people claiming he's scamming Alfred Hitchcock. He does not do. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma was showing in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original version of "Dressed to Kill", uncut, is no longer available on video. The current copy published by Goodtimes is the Jack Rated Jack Rated. But some copies of DePalma's original cut still exist. This is the one distributed by Warner Home Video, both in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, or in a black flip case with the theatrical poster on the silver background. These are the ones to get if you can find a copy. I have green and it is among my precious possessions. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's go back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife and treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for his obsessive fantasies. During a trip to the museum (a tour de force for DePalma in terms of work with the camera and suspense), <br /> <br /> Miller is caught by a stranger. You can almost guess what's happening to him, since commercials and art cartoons betray history. But there are some complications. A whore (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son, Peter (Keith Gordon), is an adolescent genius committed to solving crime. And Dr. Elliott's answering machine contains a very specific message ... about a missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I do not spoil the film for you at all, because what I've just describe will take place in the half-hour opening and the biggest surprises of DePalma are reserved for the last hour. This film is however explicit enough that Valenti (head of the MPAA) demands cuts in the film. What surprises me is what he wanted. Several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two cutting scenes and some dialogues by Nancy Allen (Valenti wanted "cock" to be changed to "bulge"). It is a very violent and bloody film, yet the objections are to sexual content. I would love to hear Valenti's explanation of seeing two women in a tender love scene in "Lost and Delirious" is somehow more damaging to a young spirit than Arnold Schwarzenegger who hunts people with a weapon chain. It is not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "Dressed to kill" so well is that not only technical credits are top notch, but the performances are also very good. Michael Caine, who was in crap at that time, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps because she plays an important role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her range of performances which considers her one of the most underrated and neglected actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is wonderful because his genius and I loved all his inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who never received the recognition he deserved. The recent joke of the list of the 100 best AFI thrillers has shown that very few people actually know what a thriller is. If they really had to open their eyes for once, they would see that DePalma has staked his career in thrillers and is in fact the best craftsman. It's even better than "Psycho". Too bad that very few people really know it. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
