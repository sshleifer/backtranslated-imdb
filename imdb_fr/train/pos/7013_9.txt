Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a heart-wrenching story that's harder than a mid-solo rock guitarist, "Seven Pounds" surpasses the director's previous collaboration with The Pursuit of Happiness, a film that I also liked. . Do not forget the name of Gabriele Muccino, because some of her films may go unnoticed if the actor associated with the project is not so well known. <br /> <br /> Too bad I understood very early the ploy of Will Smith, I put the two together when he calls his own suicide in the first scene and the scene where the character of Rosario Dawson is presented as having an incurable heart -disease. <br /> <br /> However, I still think that the screenwriter / director has made the right choice by putting the bookends (the bookends are the first and the last scene) in this way, this is the source of urgency and tension in the scenery. film, discovering exactly how a man could be led to this ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind what he was still waiting for those two unlucky ones. <br /> <br /> One of my friends I saw the film with thought that Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when he is in the presence of his seven elect, at other times he might be hard and scary, and when he is alone He has too much weight for him and he breaks down completely. It's a pretty versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget to mention the reconstruction of the scene of the accident, which was performed in a quite amazing way in terms of cinematography and music. Put this on your list.
