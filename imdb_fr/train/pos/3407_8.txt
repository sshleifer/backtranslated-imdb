Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. Ironically, Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. A really beautiful cinematography and scenery, and yes, Dietrich's bottomless clothing chest is also fabulous. She looks great; Boyer looks young and neat. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman in search of meaning and that of a former priest in search of life seem rather tired, but it is somehow worked against such unreal scenery partition of Max Steiner, and a good distribution. The film lasts about 76 minutes and seems poorly mounted. Some characters appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson, the mother superior. Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the diviner and Basil Rathbone play ... well I'm not sure. He comes from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert had to play with Dietrich. I can not help thinking that he would have been wonderful. The role of Boris, tired of the whole world, would have agreed very well with the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), her career might have resumed. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any other film of the 30s that Dietrich made in color. She looks great and wears beautiful clothes. My favorite is the Valentino in the Shiek style that she wears by the pool. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth the detour for the sumptuous sets, the color and the two big stars.
