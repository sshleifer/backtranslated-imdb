Dick Tracy was originally a cartoon created in 1931 by Chester Gould. It's a plainclothes detective tracking down a team of villains, ranging from all types of visually original characters such as Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the '40s that Warner Bros. created their own version of the Tracy villains in such drawings as Daffy Duck). especially the wristwatch communicator), who had his share of the screen time for this excellent film. The music was done wonderfully by Danny Elfman and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they were not the highlight of her career. It's weird because when you watch the movie and watch the suspense, the movie is so much like Batman, because of Elman's memorable sound for his tracks. <br /> <br /> I like the kid with the hard speeches, Pacino, who plays the role of Big Caprice Boy (and this chin!), Madonna attacks nastiness, and the cinematography and the realization are impeccable. This film was made with great professionalism and features tons of great actors who have long been known for their role (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost as if Beatty saw herself as Tracy in a past life or something else because it fit the room perfectly. <br /> <br /> I had to give this film an 8/10 for all that it brought to the cinema and that was neglected (for whatever reason). There has been a lot of misunderstanding about the evaluation of this film on IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and dynamic, as was the style of the sets, the wardrobe, the light and everything in this film. Go buy it today. You will not be sorry.
