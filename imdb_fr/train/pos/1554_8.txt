I saw this at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and frightening scene is the one where the German army attacks for the first time with yellow cross mustard gas. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with strange protective clothing. Experienced British soldiers put on gas masks and wait for gas clouds and German attackers again. The gas clouds are getting closer and closer and finally envelop the British defenders. The Germans are slowly advancing threateningly in their scary outfit. Suddenly, a cry from the defenders ... This gas is unlike any other they have known before .... <br /> <br /> You'll know now why I remember this scene for over 30 years and always shivering, I think you too!
