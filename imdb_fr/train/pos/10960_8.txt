I do not really remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. This is certainly a strange case - like a road accident in a road accident. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the truth is stranger than fiction and that the truth is something to be seen. I really do not understand how a fictional account of this documentary is to be released this year. How can you improve this? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin retire from New York society and hide in the Hampton. During the process, they become recluses and what is best called "crazy ladies". They would have remained hidden if the city had not decided to condemn the property for dirt and subsequent rescue by Jackie. This film was made after this rescue. All the while, you could not help thinking, "How serious was that before?" It's a look at high society on the dark side, and it's absolutely fascinating.
