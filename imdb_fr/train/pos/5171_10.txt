If I could go back there, even as an adult, and relive the days of my summer spent at the camp ... I would be there so quickly. The camps I went to were not that great. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes take people away, but we had horses and fishing. The cinematography of the film was staggering, the characters funny and credible, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. The character of Sam Raimy and his undercoats were invaluable. So who ever thought this film was lame ... I am deeply sorry because they can not suspend their unbelief long enough to be able to imagine camp life as an adult or they have never gone through children. The fact is that these people have had the opportunity to regress and become a juvenile again, as they have always done. If only I could. It was funny, smart, beautifully scripted, brilliantly performed and the artistry brings me back, so I want to watch it again and again, just for the landscape itself. Sorted as Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies but the desert becomes a character as much as the actors. Praise him, look at him, buy him and watch him again and again ... never get old. ; 0)
