"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first color film of Master Akira Kurosawa and, surprisingly, it does not deal with samurai, ronin, warlords or battlefields. It is in a very poor community of a Tokyo slum that the inhabitants are homeless drunkards, beggars, vagrants, abused women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and environment to put colors on, but these are indeed very sad stories, some of which are heartbreaking. Personally, I love the touching story of the boy and his father dreaming of a house they built and built. the story of the retarded boy who thinks he is flying a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her father-in-law. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden ?? O Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden ?? The path of life")
