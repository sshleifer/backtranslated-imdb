I do not see the point of burying a movie like this in a sulfuric sarcasm, when it is not a way of entertaining children and preparing them for the next line of goods in which they will beg madly. /> <br /> It's a funny movie. My children sat quietly all the way and loved every minute. While the villain is a little crazy with his stupid costume and ridiculous laugh, but it is much easier to take than the Pok√©mon 3 dark, dark and very morbid. <br /> <br /> My children have been watching Pokemon from the beginning and they are coming soon to the ages when they will "put the child things" and pass to others. I'm glad we enjoyed this together.
