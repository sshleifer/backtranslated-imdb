Gray Gardens was exciting and crazy and you just could not look away. It was so strange, and funny and sad and sick and ?????? .. really no words can describe. The Gray Gardens move is beyond weird. I discovered this movie reading my book Uncle John's Big Big Bathroom Reader, made by the Institute for Bathroom Readers, which was well worth the rental and was heading to the top of my line. 'waiting. This film talks about the most eccentric characters that have ever been filmed. We should watch it for their favorite Edie outfits, which I'm sure include curtains. When I'm old, I'd like to almost look like Big Edie, sneak up on normality and society.
