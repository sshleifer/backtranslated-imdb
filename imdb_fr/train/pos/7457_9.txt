This is one of the best linking games I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> The missions are very fun to play, they have a lot of action, they can be very difficult sometimes this which makes the game even more fun. the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are really good driving missions are fun to do. This James Bond game has a good story. The voiceover actors in this game are really good and it's cool that Pierce Brosnan is in this game and the characters' appearance is really good because they look like what they look like in real life, this who is really cool. Also, the graphics in this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> General note ********* on **********
