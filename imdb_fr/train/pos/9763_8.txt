Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I have ever seen in theaters. My father took my sister and me, and the funny thing is that when we got home, Dad asked us "What do you want to do now?" and we said we wanted to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad brought us back to the theater to watch it again - at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time. <br /> <br /> This film was rather scary for a five year old child. The scene with the huge ocean of candy and the hypnotic scene of camels. I do not remember much about this movie. Naturally, the beginning was magical, and some scenes - I would like to be able to find it, and I will probably look for it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
