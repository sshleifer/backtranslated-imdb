Having grown up in New York in the late '80s and early' 90s, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries made to cover this place at this time. No, Madonna did not have the idea to sail, but that's where she just took it Instead of revenge on each other or in fights of crap, the sail allowed people to "go beat "within the limits of anything that did not touch (which would justify automatic disqualification). Seeing this kind of extraordinarily talented and well-orchestrated "coups de théâtre" in the clubs was simply spectacular and all the great names of the time are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Dupre, Xtragavaganza, etc. all commemorated in period pieces like Malcom McLaren's song "Deep in Vogue" ... it did not matter who you were or where you were, because when you walked through these doors in this "magic realm" of so, you are part of something bigger than yourself / you were important / and, more importantly, creating your own moves and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become king (or queen), as the case may be. The words and the spirit were as strong as the movements on the floor. This film captures all the tension, excitement and magic of this very urban NYC energy. BRILLIANT !!! PLEASE COMMUNICATE ON DVD so that the whole world can see it !!! Thank you!
