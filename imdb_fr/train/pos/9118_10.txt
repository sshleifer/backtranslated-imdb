I saw this film with a special screening of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It's so interesting where this guy comes from. Now he is probably the most important independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers, I'm talking about filmmakers rooted in culture. The idea reflects the diversity and diversity of African themes. With his film 500 Years Later, it is an African problem. But the idea does not correspond to this mold. Show artistic diversity. The film is an entirely African cast but the subject is a human subject that most of us could understand. I love the sweet comedy it contains. And Jegede Tunde's Kora is simply amazing, it's truly a jewel of art.
