I love characters and history. Very funny with a lot of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer perform very well. I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a big hit, a handyman burned. The three actors are among my favorites and I made them in this film for special treatment. A nice addition to my vast collection of DVDs. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The killer replacements, Confidential, The long kiss Good evening, The Abyss and, The nine yards ... You'll love this movie.
