Last year, we had two films on Truman Capote who wrote the book on which this film was shot - Capote and Infamous. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine such a film being made in 1967. drama frightfully brutal; elevated to the classics of the film by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Burning Roof, The Professional, Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Robert Blake, who starred in this movie, has had so much trouble lately that his portrait of a killer in this movie may be related. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after watching it.
