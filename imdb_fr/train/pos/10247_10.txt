This film is banned in almost every foreign country I can think of. The Japanese (?) Who play this role must be really desperate for a job or we are just friends. Here's the scoop: <br /> <br /> Three thugs torture the hell of a defenseless woman, they use all sorts of things to kill her, they burn her, hit her, run her here in a chair (more 200 times!), they resort to sound torture (forcing them to listen to a static sound for more than 20 hours! It does not sound so bad at all, but it CAN drive you crazy.) They throw him tripe (probably from an animal) while she is stunned and she panics when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand finale, THE GREATEST TORTURE OF EYEBALL I HAVE NEVER SEEN! <br /> <br /> If you have not heard about these movies, and you're watching one without knowing it's a simulated movie, you're going to think it is! (Just ask Charlie Sheen) It's guaranteed to scare people and make them sick! As I said purely underground. Check if you are a fan of underground horror or foreign gore. If you are not, I strongly recommend you read the series before watching! From the point of view of gore, shock and creativity, he gets a 10, but from the screenplay and all the rest, it is a 1. An underground classic ... <br /> <br /> Ma final grade is 8/10 <br /> <br />
