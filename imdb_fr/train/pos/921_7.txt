Perhaps the Fleischer brothers have tried to find another "interesting property" to adapt, returning to their very successful incursion into the world of newspaper comics with the production of POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount). 1933. Although this is part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss B. made only a brief appearance in the short film; leaving the rest as a pilot episode for the eventual emergence of a complete series. <br /> <br /> AS is now well known, the gruff, shady-eyed and bandaged-haired sailor has become perhaps the most successful cartoon series of all time; survive and survive literally to the Fleischers and their studio until today. <br /> <br /> BACK TO THE RIGHT The reasons to try his luck were undoubtedly the reason why we tried the very famous cartoon character HENRY in a BETTY movie Release of the BOOP; the goal being the search for another series. The reasoning then seemed surely valid. HENRY was one of the most popular features in the Hearst Papers range; appearing in both the daily color supplement and Sunday's Color Comics, PUCK, THE COMICS WEEKLY. You know, "what fools these mortals are!" Do you remember that one, Schultz? IN THE movie "Hero", a bald and bald boy, and his antics on screen, solo and in tandem with Miss Betty; We were pleasantly surprised to see how well the character was treated. Both story and director Dave Fleischer presented a plethora of comic book situations and visual gags that seemed more appropriate to Little Henry's character. These thumbnails, mostly silent, were very important for the animated film while remaining faithful to the printed page; The film HENRY Feature is mainly composed of a kind of 'mime' in 4 colors. <br /> <br /> In the cartoon, titled BETTY BOOP WITH HENRY: The MOST AMUSING American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; to be fundamentally a situational exercise; to be punctuated by the usual series of gags resembling machine guns Dave Fleischer. In short, Henry spots a puppy in Betty Boop's Pet Shop window. It's a kind of love at first sight as Henry tries to buy the little puppy dog ​​with the only money he had, coins in his pocket. He is trained by Miss Boop that he would be $ 2.00 in cash from the time of the depression to make the purchase. Tears appear as the little guy comes out in a mood. <br /> <br /> BUT a respite is soon on the horizon as Betty asks the boy to watch the store as she leaves for urgent business. In return for her services, Miss Betty promises him the little dog in return. Of course, they spent a bargain and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> The cleaning of the cages and the feeding of the cattle offer the opportunity to Fleischer's crew to launch a new series of gags; this time with bird seeds, bald patty and Henry's brooms. (But not at once, of course, Schultz!) Henry's enthusiasm for mass feeding the store's avian population by literally sowing his head soon leads to a massive defection of the birds; exit of the store towards the street in a massive prison. <br /> <br /> BETTY returns to this show and expresses her disappointment and anger at the temporary care of Henry. All the bets were open, no dog for Henry. He starts to leave; depressed but soon convinces the owner to give him another shot to fix things. The head covered with seeds for birds, he manages to attack all the small feathered creatures; bring them back to their coop pet shop. Fortunately, the little guy leaves; but this time he has his own loving little puppy licking his face. <br /> <br /> UNDOUBETLY this combination was winning. We have the carefree, the energy filled, the free movement of the boy, the kindness of Betty and the emotions of the situation and the dubious outcome of the situation of the "boy and his dog". Max and Dave Fleischer had given us a kind of almost minor mini-masterpiece of a surrealist short film. <br /> <br /> We were very surprised that the HENRY series was not followed. Judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it certainly could have been maintained for a while. In any case, this team was in many ways the best Betty Boop to try pictures. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), had the most success (and had barely more Betty Boop, except for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); the HENRY Short was much better than the two following King "tryouts", BETTY BOOP AND THE LITTLE KING, BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
