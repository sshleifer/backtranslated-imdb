The premise of this film has tickled my imagination for quite some time now. We have all heard or read about it in some kind of contradictory text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly disappeared before your eyes? In fact, the last part is actually about what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates who live in a dilapidated house in the middle of a highway system. Andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers in society. This is the only reason why these two types get along so well, because they only need to turn to assistance when comfort is needed. Until ... <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, many problems are caused to them. Andrew suffers from paranoia and does not dare to leave the house. Dave fails in his job and his colleagues do not treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. The number of problems they face continues to grow until they can cope with the inevitable and deal with it. It's too much for them and they want everything to disappear ... And of course, that's exactly what's happening. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness. . At first they are surprised and have trouble understanding and managing the characteristics of this crazy environment, but then they discover that they can do just about anything they want, as it seems they are the only ones remaining. <BR /> <br /> Nothing has an incredibly small cast - in fact, apart from the first two shots of the movie, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) throughout the movie. It is clear that for this to succeed, casting must be more than prepared for the task, because in a world where nothing exists, nothing can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up shots to make it more interesting and it works pretty well. Director of Photography, Derek Rogers, also has a good way of teasing the public by retaining visual information, especially when the character sees and reacts, but we do not see it right away. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this can not be an event film and it is not. Much of the action occurs outside their home when they move in a vacuum. And this is where some of the hilarious scenes take place, especially when Andrew discovers a treat. <br /> <br /> Now, one might ask, "what does it look like?" Well, it does not look like anything. The whole world of nothing is white ... white, no matter which direction you are looking. This is the weakness of this movie ... After an hour or less, the movie becomes extremely boring to watch and there must be events to make sure it's more interesting to watch. Thank God, there are some. For example, in times when the two boys, thanks to the properties of nothing, are able to jump very high as if nothing was done of ... tofu (as Andrew claims). It's funny to see how they are immediately able to use nothing to become gods of their own small society. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the film is the decor ... The decorator Jasna Stefanovic did a great job in this movie, the house in which these two guys live is so much fun to watch, but it seems that these two live in a place like this. Overall, the design of the production is without a doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film. It is definitely worth watching ... <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the film is acting. David Hewlett and Andrew Miller both look like professional actors. The camera is on them every second of the movie and as said before, there are hardly any props in the movie, they are really on a naked stage. With a lot of character development and a few decent simple lines, an intelligent dialogue (sometimes hilarious stupid), everything works for this purpose - and it really keeps the movie off the low-budget domain to do it manually. <Br /> <br /> Let's talk about the visual effects, because they deserve to be mentioned. Nothing presents visual effects and digital prostheses equivalent to all modern horror movies. The film contains a rather dreadful sequence of dreams and, although the Drews have completely treated this scene, it is always amusing to watch it. One of the best visual effects of the film is at the end, when Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment: they have the ability to wish everything, so what if they can do it at the moment? 'upside down and make things appear? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a brilliant and well-lit film, it really helps to promote the idea of ​​their death (this is actually one of their theories), but "Nothing" is a comedy and he slowly destroys his own theory. We do not know where they are or what happened to them. We do not know if they'll ever come out, because the movie ends before we see something like that. The end, by the way, is not as good as it could have been. It is quite easy to predict what will happen, but the authors have still invented some incidents that contribute to make it a little more interesting. In the end, this is a relatively satisfactory incident. <br /> <br /> Take "Hollow Man", "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Epoch" and many more movies and you have "Nothing". It's really an amalgam of different styles, but there is no other movie (at least I know). For those who will remember Cube's original production commentary on his DVD, remember that Vincenzo Natali explained how he had invented Cube's story. He says that he and André Bijelic were roommates at once and that they were both in that extremely drab room with no hope of going out. "Nothing" could very well be the projected version of the origin of Cube's story, and to that end, it's like one of the prequels of the cube. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I enjoyed "Nothing", it's an excellent film and the different parts of the film are extremely well done with tons of clever ideas. But I think there is something missing in the film and I can not find exactly what it is ... Maybe if we have a "nothing 2", I can answer that question. "Nothing" is a good movie, but not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Final score: 7.5 / 10
