Sitting on the front porch of his Burbank home, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley were exactly the same size in every garment, except the hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the greatest stuntmen, said that every time Zorro put on his mask, it was the one on the screen. <br /> <br /> It was a little exaggerated: there were times when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in the stunts we can be satisfied that it's Ted at work. <br /> <br /> And what stunts! "The Zorro Combat Legion" is, as evidenced by the comments here, one of the biggest soap operas. It's exciting and generally very well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor and, as one other commented, he did a very good fop. <br /> <br /> But, certainly, it's the action that makes this film so great. <br /> <br /> And what could we expect, under the guidance of this great team, Witney and English, with great music from the very prolific William Lava (the list here says he was not credited, but that's incorrect, the other composers listed here were actually uncredited, and I do not know if they wrote this music (that sounds like lava), and with the wickedness of, among others, Grand Charles King, and dozens of songs? <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is Tarzan's nicknamed Jim Pierce, son-in-law of Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I urge you to read his mini -biography.) <br /> <br /> There is a chapter that slows down things in a depressing way, but hey, it only lasts a few minutes (maybe 20) and when you go through it Well, you're from back to the excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserves a big thank you for the presentation of this e xcellent series and we should ask TCM to bring more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank everyone involved for seeing it as a chapter or series game, not as a crossover function.
