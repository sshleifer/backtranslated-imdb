Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even as disturbed at 10% as this movie, well, I guess it could have been worse. Unfortunately, the video copy of this film contains inserts of sex scenes originally shot by the distributor to enhance the appeal of the box office. Several times during the film, Milligan abruptly puts an end to the camera and the silent music of film. Cute replacement characters for the Milligan actors then take over and start playing the psychedelic rock guitar of the 60's. It's easy enough to move forward quickly if you try to pay attention to the original Milligan film, which unfortunately misses a lot action that was cut to make room for added sex scenes. What remains, however, remains compelling. I do not think I've ever seen a mother more odious in any movie before.
