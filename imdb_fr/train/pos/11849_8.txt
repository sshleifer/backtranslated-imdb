If only the whole animation was so great. This movie is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects: history and character. The characters in this film are beautifully personified. I felt for all the characters, and the man-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. The beautiful animation and computer animation in 3D have not worked better in any other film. This is an excellent movie for kids and adults who want the trip of a classic hero. 8 out of 10
