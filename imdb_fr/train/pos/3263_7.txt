I usually like movies like "Chances Are", but this one did not really satisfy me for several reasons. The first period was rather well done overall, with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated into a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He finds his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and his friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes where they meet again and where Downey rediscovering who he was was well done, and there is a lot of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes that it's really her husband who is reincarnated, but from from there, the film deteriorates. Several scenes related to sex completely shocked me, especially Downey and Shepherd who wish to meet again, despite the age difference that currently separates them. After that, the film manages to end in the most satisfactory way possible given the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral in the end. This story had great potential and the scenes in paradise are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but finally the film is not great. For a better similar film, try "Heaven Can Wait". Decent, but I really wish I did not see it because of the scenes of the second half. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
