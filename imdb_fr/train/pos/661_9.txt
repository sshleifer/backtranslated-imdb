Ho, ho, homicidal maniac! This animated adaptation of EC Comics' great horror tale is without a doubt one of the best episodes of the TV series ever made. Director Robert ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis makes the most of Fred's spiritual scenario ("The Night of the Creeps", "The Monster Squad"), dekker, which centers on a ruthless housewife in two schedules (well played by Mary Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she played in this episode) who kills her horrid sodomy of a husband (a beautiful Marshall Bell cameo) on Christmas Eve by beating him in the head with a poker. Complications ensue when a murderous murderous madman, disguised as merry Kris Kringle, escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to return to Trainor a resolutely hostile visit. Alan Silvestri's phantasmagorical score and Dean Cundey's polished cinematography further reinforce the macabre pleasure. And Larry Drake (the nice kind giant Benny in "L.A. Law"!), With his giggling hiccups, a glimmer of dementia in his bright green eyes, and a really nasty smile, make Saint Nick a bloody sensual.
