are the highlights of this 1917 feature. Clan Pride tells the story of a young girl who becomes chieftain after the death of her father. On an island off the coast of Scotland, villagers lead a simple life of "fishermen". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the film offers beautiful ocean landscapes and the work of the camera on the boats is magnificent. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant movie. Pickford was already a big star in 1917 and this film seems to have been written for her: a brave young woman succeeds after the misfortune. The Pickford whip whipping the lazy villagers toward the church is a lot of fun. And the final scenes on the flowing boat are very well done. Not a good Picford movie, but it's worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the interest of love, and he is good as a boy attached to the island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I could not find her either. My copy intermingles a lot of bells and gongs and adds a strange feeling when the village warning bells ring. Very effective.
