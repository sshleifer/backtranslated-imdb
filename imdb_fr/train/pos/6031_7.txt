Cinémathèque, about 200 members of an American film company from Cleveland, Ohio, met on August 19, 2000 to view a blank copy of the film "Zabriskie Point" by Michelangelo Antonioni from 1970. The director of the film library John Ewing, who strived to get the best draws in his series, told the public that this draw was specially flew over Italy for this single projection. <br /> <br /> The film unveiled its artistic sense on the large panoramic screen. Looking at this superb copy, in accordance with Antonioni's wishes, we realized that it was indeed a modern work of art. It was all the more appropriate for the series to be hosted by the Cleveland Institute of Art in University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions are created for the cinematographic landscape. His beautiful balance of images, his striking use of colors, his choreographic movements, are all the work of a true artist, using the screen as a backdrop. <br /> <br /> Finally, the public could understand "Point Zabriskie". As the narrative unfolded, it became clear that this work was not about a story in itself, but rather an impressionistic rendering by an artist of fleeting images of his subject. The setting of some of the most turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic driving force to the artist's rapid collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can stop at any time to creatively embroider an event with grandiose decorations. The public has voluntarily followed the thread of his remarkable imagination, while his immense images on the gigantic canvas held all the attention. Although the audience may have been involved only tangentially in character relationships, he understood that the theme discussed here is human randomness, a recurring theme of the director. <br /> <br /> We have also realized that no impression as small or as mediocre as the original one of Cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering. The public was therefore all the more grateful to have seen "Zabriskie Point" in its original and breathtaking format, before resounding with a thunder of applause.
