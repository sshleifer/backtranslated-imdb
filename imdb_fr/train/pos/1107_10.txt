In the classical sense of the four moods (which are not specific to the concept of entertainment or even entertainment), Altman "H.E.A.L.T.H." treats all moods, and in a very funny and fun way. There is phlegm, embodied by Esther Brill, the very slow, reserved and protective character of Lauren Bacall, whose mission in life seems to be quite aesthetic, protecting the secrets of her age and her beauty more than her good -be. There is Dr. Gil Gainey of Choleric, of Paul Dooley, who looks like a fish out of the water (maybe more like a seal), rushes frantically, barking and urging crowds to subscribe to his madness aquatic. Glenda Jackson's melancholy, Isabella Garnell, recalls Shakespeare's troubled and perverse hamlet - even offering a monolith or two. And let's not forget the character of Henry Gibson in Bile, Bobby Hammer ("The breast that feeds the baby rules the world"). Then there are characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively healthy characters who strive to balance all the companions and extreme moods that have come together for H.E.L.T.H. - a sort of world organization of the specialized trade in the companies H.E.A.L.T.H., that is to say everything except health. It's Altman at its best classic.
