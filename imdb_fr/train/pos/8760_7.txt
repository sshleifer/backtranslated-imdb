It's refreshing to see a film that you think will end well, like almost every other American movie, and be surprised when it does not happen. I like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to describe things more realistically, and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The end, with one friend essentially sacrificing himself for the other, thus redeeming his former mediocre behavior that had put them in the situation originally, was very moving. I could almost do without the last line, which proved that she did not really commit the act she had confessed, because it would have allowed the film to be more tied to the friendship between the two. girls and less to crime. Whether she does it or not, it was not that important. <br /> <br /> The story itself was a clich√©, but the actresses caught my attention for their excellent performances. Very realistic, very captivating. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
