Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> In her own words, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a brand new cast, is just mild enough and refined enough to work better. only the English version version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is a larger element (or more beautiful as a presence on the screen) and his game is more sober. And she seems frankly more comfortable, probably for a lot of reasons, but presumably she was not making her first shot, so she adjusted quickly. <br /> <br /> Without always comparing one film to another, this Anna Christie is always the same O'Neill plays with too many words. The themes of a woman who seeks love without losing her independence are here, but it is oddly out of date. Some scenes are missing - the Coney Island section is shortened and not so good - but overall, it's a direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feyder (French-Belgian), simply redoes what has already been done, which I suppose must be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see the two films successively because they are blocked in exactly the same way (not only the sets, but the shots are all identical). There is sometimes a scene raised in the previous film - part of the storm, of course, but also a brief scene where Marie Dressler (of the English version) walks with her friend on a board at the edge of a canal, drunk. . But these are just silhouettes, and when the next scene unfolds, we see the German actors play their role. Admittedly, there is no way to replace Dressler, but for me, the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Clearly the themes - immigration, lost fathers, girls turning to prostitution and the trouble of finding true love - have strong currents at the time, especially with sons (Garbo plays, appropriately, a young Swedish woman).
