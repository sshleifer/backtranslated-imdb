As a native of Bolton, this film has obvious appeal to me. The shots are fascinating and show a very transitioning Bolton - there are a number of scenes of apparent abandonment but it serves to show that the city is being rebuilt - and the idea that the old must give way to the new is at the heart of reality. of this film. James Mason, a little confused, runs a nice set in a story about a hubbub around a herring that turns into a conflict of generations in its own right, then into a pleasantly schmaltzy resolution. Although I am a little too young to remember it completely, the minuteness of life in Lancashire in the 60s is at the rendezvous: encaissement a Friday, songs around the piano, constitutional Sunday, good neighborhood, trepidations Bridal show, the importance of self-respect and I was pleased to see the funniest parts of Naughton's play left intact. There is no doubt that this film should be available on DVD - it is well designed and most performances are well done.
