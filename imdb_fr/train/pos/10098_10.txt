Dominion Tank Police is without a doubt one of the most incredible shows ever produced, but not only in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) consists mainly of action and amusement, the second part is more serious and the second part should not be treated in exactly the same way as the first part. The subtleties are really out of this world and the characterization is more than brilliant. You must have an additional degree of intelligence to appreciate the subtleties of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, the Tank Bonaparte jumps literally over a shell and that makes no sense. One can also wonder about the plausibility of Bonaparte to jump on the wing of Helicopter Gunship, even if it was cool. Rules of Buaku.
