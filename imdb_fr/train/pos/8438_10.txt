HLOTS was an exceptional series, what the NYPD Blue will never be, on HLOTS, the graphs are real, the dialogue is real, the relations are real. With HLOTS back in the movie, it was good to reunite all the gangs, even some of them who died (without saying how). The scenario was fast, emotional and witty. the series was week after week. Homicide, life on the streets, network drama at its best !!!! 5 STARS!!!! Bravo and all that. Thank you NBC for giving us the last we did not have!
