Has there ever been a more charming film than this one? One of the reasons that everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on everyone's life. The center of it is the "novel" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can not get along, but who are completely in contact anonymously as correspondents. But there are also secondary characters and, unlike many romantic comedies (like "You've Got Mail", the recent update of "Shop"), they are not just inspired to support the two main roles and their needs. Everyone becomes an integral part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich charming tapestry. One of the most comforting scenes in film history occurs when Frank Morgan, almost tragically, casually and humbly seeks someone to take a Christmas dinner with. A must see! **** out of ****
