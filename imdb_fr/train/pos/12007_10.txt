It's one of the most spiritual movies I've ever seen. I went with about 150 people to St. George and we saw this film in the St. George Temple Visitor Center. Nobody had dry eyes in the audience. In addition, there were non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by the captivating music and re-enactment of the pioneers' story and the difficulties they faced. because of their convictions. /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about Joseph and the difficulties that the pioneers have gone through. After all, it's outside of American history.
