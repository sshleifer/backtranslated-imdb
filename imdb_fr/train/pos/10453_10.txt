Traveling by train across Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Frenchwoman Céline (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States of America and Céline to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite novels, and even one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low-budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect and the dialogue is amazing. The direction is incredible, conveying the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer. I just finished my number 1000 in IMDb, and I chose "Before Sunrise" for this important number, because it is a very special film for me. I do not understand why this film was not nominated for the Oscars, with a scenario, direction and performances so magnificent. Yesterday I probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time and I still love it. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before sunrise")
