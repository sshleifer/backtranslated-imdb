I fell in love with this drama of silent action. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played so well. Todd (Kurt Russell), who grew up in his childhood and knows nothing about the war, is thrown on a planet after being rendered obsolete by genetically modified soldiers. <br /> <br /> born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, nor Schwarzenegger, nor Bruce Willis, nor Mel Gibson, nor Jason Statham - Kurt Russell has this role and made it entirely his - original, daring and too human. The fact that suites have never been done I miss. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> _________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com / NY5 / jbc33 /
