Myself, I'm a kid at heart, which means I like to watch cartoons, do it again! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a child, he was always my favorite. I thought dude, it was a great "new" show on TV, and then my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching it when I was younger" and I thought, " Dad, the insects did not exist were younger. So, I guess it has definitely pleased more than a generation, maybe three years. I like the show, it's great for kids and adults, all right. This is very fun. My husband and I, both 20, love watching shows, and we do not mind. This show brings back a lot of memories, happy. I also like the Christmas special with Tweety like Tiny Tim, it's cute. I can not choose my favorite Looney Toons character because it has changed over the years. When I was little, it was of course Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always liked him. In fact, I have to say all my favorites. I give this show a 10 out of 10, because it's a very good show for all ages, very funny, the dubbing is amazing, the only flaw is that, unfortunately, it ended, two decades ago but reruns are awesome!
