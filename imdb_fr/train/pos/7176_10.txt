OK - you want to test the comfort of your teenage years and the annoying and annoying changes it has undergone - then react immediately by watching this horrifying documentary about children making socially relevant horror films in the suburbs of the 80s. More that every other film I've ever seen, the movie deals with sexuality and the ego, in a completely human way, never dull, and brimming with the kind of goodness inherent to youth that is discolored by the adult world frantic, where everything weird in the young is accredited to nothing, from madness to perversion. The mini-nabob Darren Stien seems to be trying to better understand his triumphs and apprehensions as a patriarch of the world of children. What he finds in himself and others is not always pretty - but shows how one can improve and be reconciled with age. What change means without reflection. I love that movie.
