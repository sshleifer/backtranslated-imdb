After reading the book, I found myself facing this DVD at Wal-Mart for $ 3 and I thought, of course, what the hell ... I had the DVD and I watched it last night . When I started to look at it, I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, OK, cool ... It seemed to run rather slowly, knowing the story and its contents. At the moment when I arrived at the massacres, I said to myself, "How long is that?" Checked. "One minute, what's this mess?" I felt incredibly wrong, thinking that the film had only progressed by a third of the story. <br /> <br /> But, fortunately, I noticed with pleasure that the DVD scene selection menu included a part 1 AND a part 2. I have left I had an hour and a half left! I then sat very happy and enjoyed the second half of the film, even more than the first. <br /> <br /> I admit that I did not see the original film of 1967 (despite my most sincere desire), however, I read the novel and felt that it was a pretty descending film, for a television mini-series, that is to say. I think the cast of Perry's role was completely wrong and some minor inconsistencies leapt out at me, but still very well done. The first half hangs a bit, while the second half is much more striking. I think they should have proportioned the film more like Capote than his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the arrest of the assassins. Instead, the movie makes it 1/2 more before the murders, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the murderers' arrest. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time, less convincing while dragging the first half over and over ... <br /> <br /> Now, I look back and I realize that I just did the same thing. mistake to drag things along, so I'm going to shut up. Go watch the movie and make your own idea! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
