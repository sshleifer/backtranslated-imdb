I still enjoy this movie when it appears on TV. <br /> <br /> The scene that always stands out, for me, is the one with Myrna Loy and the foreman of the painters, where she gives him many explicit instructions on the colors and as soon as she leaves, he turns his guys over and says, "Did you get it, it's yellow, blue, green and white"
