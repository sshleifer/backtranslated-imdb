(No spoilers, just plot details) I can not understand such hatred for this episode. Want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Look at Subterranean - now there is a bag of shit. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I do not say that very often), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he does it most of the time. The scenario of an alternative universe seems strangely realistic. The Martian Men Hunter, who had previously appeared in "Static", returns and tells Clark that the doctor responsible for the lunatic asylum where they are being held is actually a ghost of the ghost zone, and if Clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill him. A great episode, with a good acting and a decent pace.
