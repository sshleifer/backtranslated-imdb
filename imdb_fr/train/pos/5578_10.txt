The comedian / director for the first time, Peter M. Cohen, describes this comical and offbeat perspective of the dating world. The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet each week at the local dinner to discuss their dating issues. We meet Brad: a handsome boy with an urban style, quick wit and sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical and sensitive writer; Jonathan: a nice guy and sexually puzzled with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: the married guy, who cherishes his weekly meetings with his unmarried friends in the hope of enlightening his boring and mundane married life. The trials and tribulations of the single life of men in New York are expressed in a fun way, like Sex in the City and HBO's new comedy, The Mind of Married Man, and bring a clever light to fraud. The story takes a turn when the three singletons meet Mia - interpreted wittily by Amanda Peet - and all fall in love with her. She seduces them with her astonishing ability to conform to the personalities they present. When they realize that they all met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her for their friendship. Whipped is a realistic representation of the dating world, which the critic did not recognize. In plain language, they misunderstood. The protagonists here are caricatures of real people. The exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and should not be taken as seriously as the critic's denigration suggests. See this movie, you will laugh from beginning to end.
