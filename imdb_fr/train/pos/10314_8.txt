This one and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my comment on the new series, something is missing in this new series. Perhaps they insist too much on the lesson to be learned. It's a bit more mawkish and sentimental than the Serling version. However, this episode can also be considered very sentimental. I think the call is that no matter what they do, lovers can never unite. I remember that I was not surprised by the Korean movie "Il Mare" (later redone in "The Lake House") I think it's because I saw this episode first, which thus ruined the impact of the subsequent film.
