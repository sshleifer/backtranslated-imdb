An excellent series, masterfully interpreted and directed, but unloved (told me) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation. It is now only visible in private collections and via the British Film Institute upon special request. Very unhappy, Bernard Samson's nuanced representation, exhausted but determined, by Ian Holm is superb; one of his best performances. The actors, especially the young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are superb. With Mel Martin playing the conflicting wife and traitor, and Michael Degen as mercurial Werner, the story positively flirts with the tragic and fatal personal consequences of the great match.
