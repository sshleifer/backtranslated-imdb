It is a powerful documentary on domestic violence in Cameroon. The "sisters" in law are lawyers who, in 2004, sued husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and divorced a woman she desperately wanted through a council. Muslim. It is rather long - about two hours - but fascinating for both the complainants and the accused and for the lawyers who have successfully represented them in the courtrooms presided over by female judges. This will leave me, as I have left, many questions about exactly how this change has occurred. How and when did women end up in positions of responsibility in Cameroon? Have the many cases presented in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women by their wives? Was the granting of divorce by a Muslim court, contrary to the express wishes of the husband, a punctual event? I'm not saying that the filmmakers could have answered these questions. They did the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they did deserves a wide audience.
