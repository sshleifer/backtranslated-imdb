This film tells an incredible story with history and compassion. From the detailed descriptions of crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator, you will be seduced. This is a must for anyone interested in criminology. Relations between Interpol and the agencies' collaboration are also excellent. Not too much either. I also recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history. How does the police work with the political party? It's really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. I have not seen this movie for the first time for a long time. This does not diminish the impact. Not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough imagination, and well, you'll see.
