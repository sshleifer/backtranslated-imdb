I just watched this version of "Samhain", and although I still love it, it has nothing to do with the "approximate" version I have. If you check the message board, the director will apologize for the reduced version, which is 79 minutes. He says he has nothing to do with this lite R-rated edition with a whole new damn ending. Christian really does not need to go so far, because the basic elements of the gore remain, although very reduced. It's a shame, because it has the potential to be one of the hottest and best gore movies in years. He still has pornstars, and idiots, and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen. I'm just happy to have this "rough cut" because for me it's a jewel for any gorehound library. Christian Viel definitely has the skills and vision to deliver the goods, and we hope his next project will be better produced. The fools had a classic almost in their hands, and the mess for everyone. "Samhain" is perhaps one of the most controversial and mishandled horror films of all time, and too bad for the gorehounds who did not have a chance to see what the director wanted to do. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** Just so that you know what you missed, this is my comment based on the "work" of SAMHAIN. <br /> <br /> The film lasts a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stopped. There is absolutely NO music soundtrack, and some scenes do not have audio in the dialogue, because I think they are supposed to be looped later. However, most movies have sound and audio effects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a marker to insert after the movie is finished. This is exactly what it says, a "rough cut", but the only uncut version of "samhain" that you are likely to see. Reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than would allow an NC-17. Yes, there are some porn stars, but they are only there for murder, to add some sugar and spices. The story is rather classic: American tourists go on holiday in Ireland and end up staying in a house in the middle of the woods. A heavily folkloric field, involving the ancient druids and the celebration of Samhain, or what we call Halloween. (Spooky) <br /> <br /> The film begins with a huge dose of gore, while a couple of campers are attacked by one of the local mutants. It's a gore scene, while the guy finds his daughter hanging on a cliff, crying for help. He only sees his head, his arms and his shoulders hanging in front of him and when he raises her, she is completely cut in half. This is what I would call EXTREME GORE, with entrails, blood and sliced ​​limbs everywhere. We are on the territory of Herschell Gordon Lewis here, except that the effects seem much more realistic. I'm just going to ignore the story because it's your usual plot. <br /> <br /> The next gore scene is something to see as the boyfriend of the first murder is taken to a cave. (TCM-2 stuff), and linked to a table. This geek cuts him all limbs (except camera, with a marker to insert a scene), then we see his chest on a barbecue, slowly turning on a fire, and the torso is hard (if you can believe that). Yes, very bad taste, disgusting, macabre, you find the right word, and it will probably be appropriate too. <br /> <br /> Then, later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything else, is cut off from the neck to the fork, and all her bowels are drawn in graphic joy, and her blood flows into a pot. Yum, a real turning point, huh? <br /> <br /> But the best gore scene is happening inside the house, and I have to admit it's one of the best gore scenes I've ever seen. This guy (whoever) is caught from behind by a geek and cut in the asshole. The geek then puts his hands in and tears all the guts of the guy, his intestines, and what the heck there is always, just in his asshole. It lasts forever, as the guy screams and more and more interns are spread on the floor of the bathroom. It's so extreme, so exaggerated, that I found myself laughing in hell. Obviously, you will NEVER see this scene on an appropriate DVD, IMO, with most other extremely extreme scenes. <br /> <br /> So what about all this? First of all, even if I doubt that this film will ever be presented in this totally uncut presentation, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare jewel for gorehounds. Yes, it's a bit difficult at first, without soundtrack, some scenes to insert, and generics that have missing names everywhere. But that's what makes it so unique, and I would not trade it for nothing right now. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme gore. That makes "High Voltage" look like a Disney movie.
