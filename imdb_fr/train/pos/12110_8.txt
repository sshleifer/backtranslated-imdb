For those of you who think that anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls, think again. Japanese animation has a totally different side. Yakitate! Japan is one of these shows. It's a sweet story of young boy with the gift of making delicious bread. His world is to create a Japanese bread that can be harmonized with the famous European breads. The show is as crazy as they come and I'm sure that non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of jokes. But it's still very nice to watch because of the totally innocent atmosphere of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! it is not uncommon for people to seem to have an orgasm after eating bread. Bread is amazing and can give the consumer a wide range of super powers, from traveling in time to swimming like a fish. This strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and entertaining shows I've watched in a while.
