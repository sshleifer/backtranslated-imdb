The closest clip I have ever seen is a clip presented at a GÃ©rard Philippe exhibition in Paris about two years ago. The remake did not interest me and, after catching up with the original a little more than half a century after its creation, I can only conclude that inept fencing was intentional and aimed at a long-standing obsolete target. Hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 1930s, when the greatest of them, Basil Rathbone, crossed leaves with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and it left than satire. After a while, you will not notice or delight in the dialogue of Henri Jeanson reminiscent of Prisoner of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the necessary presence to play a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a little better than Martine Carol, the other obvious candidate of the time. The impression I saw was particularly bad and at one point it completely collapsed, a DVD version might improve it.
