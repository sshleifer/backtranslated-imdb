Given how stupid these films are, you must understand that they must have had fun making them. The film focuses on a house that strangely welcomes anyone who lives there. The inhabitants were: the author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who approaches a little too much of the wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose kindness is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), about to enter the character a little too much. <br /> <br /> "The house that blew the blood" is definitely worth seeing (well, it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). In addition to being cured, there could be some nuances: this could call into question the real horror against the supposed horror. As in "The Shining", one may wonder if the house / hotel itself retains memories of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paul's co-star) is HOT HOT HOT! At about the time of her release, she also starred in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Like Barbara Steele, she may still be known as a scream queen, but notice my words: SHE IS A QUEEN OF SCREAM! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele co-animate something. <br /> <br /> I guess the only strange scene (so to speak) is where Denholm Elliott wears a pink shirt and a fluffy jacket. You read correctly. What kind of name is "Denholm" anyway? Never mind. A very cool movie.
