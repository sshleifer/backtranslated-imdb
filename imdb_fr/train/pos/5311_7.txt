John Waters' most accessible film to date is one of his best films, considering that he is destroying all the outright vulgarity and vulgarity that seem to cover most of his previous work. Of course, nudity and sexual references are always there, at least they are presented <br /> <br /> which can not be considered too coarse or disgusting. Thanks to some remarkable casting choices, this film really brought to light the stupidity associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Funny and somewhat cheerful (if it's possible for Waters), this is one of those movies I would watch on a rainy day.
