Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is involved in a murderous crime without knowing it, and dominoes are increasing the dangers, adventures and mishaps in the distressed American West of the 1990s. West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage gets the mix with his usual sardonic wit and mistrustful ease. <br /> <br /> Is the plot above? Yes. Dennis Hopper is it perfect as a crazy killer, almost friendly? Yes. Cage has a chance? Well, you have to look and see. It never breaks and it took me by surprise the first time I saw it. During our second viewing yesterday, I was surprised at how much he was holding, how well it was built and how macabre and funny it was at the same time. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) He is best known for his work on television, but with Rounders and this film, he shows a clever hand with sensational intrigues. It's saved by his humor by the way, and by the caricatures. The bar is shady, the cops are questionable. And do not miss a cameo really inspired by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
