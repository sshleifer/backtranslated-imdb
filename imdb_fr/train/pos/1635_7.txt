Back in Salina, Kansas, they filmed something called "The brave young men of Weinberg", and film crews played a leading role for weeks. finally, we learned that the movie was "Up The Academy", and was a bit humble, "the lower front" than we had been led to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it because I was there, and the local audience seemed less than pleased with the projection. I was 17 years old and I thought it was a pretty naive "animal house" type comedy, even going so far as to joke about farting. <br /> <br /> I have watched it a few times since then, and my opinion has softened a bit. It's silly, but sometimes, it captures a bit of "crazy" humor in magazines, at least as well as most "Mad TV". Ron Liebman might hate him, but he's almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on Santa Fe Avenue, where I had parked my car, while I was buying guitar strings. Too bad the brief appearance of my Pinto usually seems to be cut off for television. I have not seen the new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
