I swear I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get tired! All aspects of human emotion are captured magically by the acting, the script, the realization and the overall feeling of this film. It's been a long time since I saw a film that made me choke with laughter, reflect sadness and feel every feeling that transpires in this great job! We need more movies like that !!! Mike Binder: Are you listening ???
