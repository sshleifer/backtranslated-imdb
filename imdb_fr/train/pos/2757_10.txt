If you want to see a film of a different kind, if you feel the love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this film makes you think. Although George is mentally disabled, you can see the ultimate intelligence in the end, when love gives you guidance and not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there is not enough publicity to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films, having almost the same taste.
