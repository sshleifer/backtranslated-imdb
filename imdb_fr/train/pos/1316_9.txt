I just finished watching this well-designed and beautifully played / directed movie. I was wondering if I was going to waste my time watching a movie on Lifetime Movie Network because of the horribly annoying ads. Reading the previous comments convinced me to try it. After all, the worst that could happen would be that I fall asleep during one of the annoying but endless commercials. So why did I watch it? mainly because, when IMDB gives a movie a "weighted average" of 5.8, the WHO statistical average was 7.3. and all. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on difficult roles, adapting her main character to each role. <br /> <br /> The portrait she painted in this detective film, both hard and human, has been beautifully executed. When the scene calls for fast, quick and witty verbal reports, she can confront any actor. Yet she is adept at delivering volumes of emotional responses without saying a word that relies only on facial expression and body language. Without commercials that, by design, kill the continuity of any good film, it would have been a real headache at the edge of the seat. I gave him a 9.0
