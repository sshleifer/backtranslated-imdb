... He beats even the "gross" villain. This show is almost twenty years old and I laughed a lot when I watched it last night. This shows Eddie Murphy wearing tight red clothes (Old School) and he's joking with everything from celebrities to his family. He was only 22 years old at the time and it is not to be missed! <br /> <br /> 8/10
