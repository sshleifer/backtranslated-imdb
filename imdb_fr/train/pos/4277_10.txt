"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A tragicomedy with profound implications for the destiny of humanity, shown through the eyes of apparently very clear and ordinary people in a Serbian province abandoned by God, just before the beginning of the Second World War. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film had a very limited distribution, and I have not had the opportunity to discover it since. It's such a shame that this great movie is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it several times and, alas, I found none. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little gem of filming to suggest ways to buy a copy.
