A fiery policeman accidentally kills a murder suspect and then conceals the crime, but faces a guilty conscience while trying to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney find the director Preminger in a black film as effective as "Laura", their previous collaboration. Andrews is perfectly qualified as a serious policeman, a man well taken in unfortunate circumstances. The role is perfect, including Malden as a police captain and Tully as a protective father of Tierney. Hecht's script, a formidable and prolific screenwriter, is tense and suspenseful, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
