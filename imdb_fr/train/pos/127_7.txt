Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another dark film taking place in the rubble of post-war Europe. Like TTM, there is a lot of inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who is emotionally involved with a woman whom he does not really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in comparison to the natives. <br /> <br /> But I must say that The Third Man has a more elaborate scenario. Zentropa is a little disjointed in this respect. It may be intentional: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This film is implacably dark - "black" in more than one sense; we never see the sun shine. Grim, but intriguing and scary.
