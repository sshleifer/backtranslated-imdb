Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) leaves the reform school and returns to the shantytowns. Her sister (Ann Sheridan) does her best to keep him out of trouble, but that seems to follow him. In addition to his links with the gang Termite, Gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who are planning to set buildings on fire at random to collect insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and that's Gabe. It is up to the Termites to enforce the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just dessert. <br /> <br /> The scene that presents the Dead End Kids is really good. The boys go to the furniture of the new inhabitant in the street and proceed to their manufacture. They talk to each other with whimsical accents and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap on a chair. The boys then go on a fight with the new boy, but after being a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. <br /> <br /> The initiation scene is pretty good too, full of mischief That sounds dangerous at first, but it is rather intelligent and innocent. <br /> <br /> Later, when Billy Halop studies to become the young mayor, he dreams of doing his homework. This is beautifully staged, with tiny holograms of children walking on his face and asking him questions. <br /> <br /> Angels Wash Their Faces is an excellent title as it plays the success of the movie Angels With Dirty Faces, and really tells what kids are doing. Notorious for their bad behavior on and off the set, these boys do well in this movie. But rather than appearing dishonest, it makes you laugh. This is a preview of what many boys would become in The Bowery Boys series. We even have some confused words from Leo Gorcey.
