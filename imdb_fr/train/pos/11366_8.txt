A superb and convincing drama on the hunt for the famous Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. The Russian government, especially former Communist Party members who wish to maintain a closed society, is performing a magnificent performance of Stephen Rea as a forensic pathologist. He finds the main obstacle to his progress. <br /> <br /> The film has an underlying theme about the decline of communist society, and the progress of the murderer's research is reflected by the progress of social and political changes in Russia, which are subtly expressed. There is a conflict of old and new ways, which are represented by the two points of view of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rea himself. These are first polarized, with Sutherland "high" in the system looking down, and Rea "down" on the floor, looking up. However, they have a common cause ?? to catch the serial killer. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the relationship between these two people develops and the tension fades until, at the end of the film, Rea and Sutherland respect each other, the killer is taken, and Glasnost comes symbolically. Excellent scenario. <br /> <br /> We also owe the performance of Sutherland, who is superb and friendly, Jeffrey DeMunn, the murderer we despise but we can not hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is just as convincing as the humble psychologist who puts his reputation at risk.
