I must say that as a fan of BSG, I did not know what I would think of this show. I saw it on the big screen at the Arclight cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center screenings), and the actors and filmmakers then took the floor. Ron Moore said they "wanted to take a break from Battlestar and do something different, and that yes, they would lose some fans, but I hope they would win more." <br /> <br /> Even without their conversation, I am now a fan of the new series. But here's what I thought of the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it. It was really good. I guess I'm a real sci-fi (or 'syfy' - do I really have to type that?) Geek, because I would look at it like a series, it has a strong and rich story, and kept my interest. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small A group of teenagers scheming something, which for me was the weakest and most confusing part of it The actor playing "Ben" should have given us The actress playing "Zoe" seemed a bit scathing, but she was playing a teenager (and I'm sure I would not be the only one to think that "Zoe" was a Cylon in the beginning, he is If they hope it will be the new Bamber / Helfer / Park, they may want to rethink it - it's really the adults who have caught the public eye. /> <br /> Eric Stoltz star performer Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by family tragedy that he jumps on the first occas to get out of his grief and not let go. He does a frightening and exciting job of transmitting the sneaky knowledge of his character to the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he turns a canvas for the teenage girlfriend of his daughters, the trap, and then the return and release it. No sign of the "serial killer" he played in Gray's Anatomy, a truly awesome acting game. <br /> <br /> Paula Malcomson is just as strong, but not as much, as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is just as smart and well written and plays the role of Stoltz beautifully. I firmly believed that it was a couple and a couple that had always been united and had a strong relationship, something rarely seen today. I can not wait to see what's going on with this family and I hope she gives it as much to do as Roslin in BSG - she's strong and smart and when she picks on her child, you are fed up, it's really great. Not to mention his eyes, which might contain magical powers, is their intensity. The scene where she faces the government agent - very short, but beautifully played - really gives you an idea of ​​his power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the series that did not work 100% for me was the scenes with Esai Morales, and his mafia type clan. It does a good job overall, but I did not believe in this power of crowds, nor intimidated by their threats. I found myself wishing this whole story to be a little more mysterious and difficult to understand; The way it is presented is almost a tribute to the godfather, they hit you a little head with it. But over time, I can see how this is going to turn into some sort of interesting thing "Up / Down", with poor minorities (Morales et al) versus the rich people who run the planet (Stolz et al) . And to be honest, I liked talking to her son about the origin of his name. It was a very well played scene. <br /> <br /> Note to BSG fans, the boy playing "Willy Adama" does not really look like Olmos, but he's just a kid. Whether or not it's presented, any more than in this movie, who knows? I really could not say. But that did not bother me, because it was not as interesting as everything around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "Sister Clarice" and she is icy and strange in all the scenes in which she is. I do not know where she will go or who she will finish with, but I was very impressed by her role. In this film, she was a little on the side, but she obviously had to play a very important role later on. She did not look anything like her "Rome" character, which I always find impressive in the actors. <br /> <br /> A nice surprise: the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, even if it's the same guy doing it, Bear McCreary. His obsessive and unusual approach took me by surprise. I would buy this score if I had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> As for the "discussion-debate" after the show, she was led by Seth Green. . Ron Moore was very intelligent and articulate, David Eick was very wise (much like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was chosen, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not really answered the questions (but have always had a thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she blamed Seth Green for falsely saying she was on "24"), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both beloved. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also present and answered questions about how they performed the scenes while playing BSG. Overall, this evening is very interesting and wonderful. <br /> <br /> I give the show a score of 9 out of 10, and I can not wait to see it unfold. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the HOLOBAND was designed for. I have no idea what it can be, but it fascinates me a lot.
