I had waited a few years before this film finally came out in England, but I was in many respects very happy when I finally saw it. There are many good things in the movie, to start acting. It's not something I need so much in a horror picture, but everyone in this movie did a good job. This and the scenario constantly captivating and interesting, with a kind of Lovecraftian sensations, give the film a real backbone. Add to that the doses of surreal nightmare images and occasionally horrible gore and winning movies. He also has my favorite kind of gore, supernatural and splash. In addition, the characters of Marcus, the angry bodybuilding transsexual, and Daisy, his mentally deficient lover / toy, are truly phantasmagoric and annoying at the same time, and give an impression of morbid madness that works well with the frequent Freudian accents. . This is one of the most impressive recent horror movies, far more shocking than anything Hollywood can produce. My only complaint is that I wanted the end to be darker, but it still works, so overall, I really recommend it to all horror enthusiasts.
