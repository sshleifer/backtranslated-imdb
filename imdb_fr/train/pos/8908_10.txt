First of all, I had not seen "The Blob" since I was 7 or 8 years old and seeing it as an adult was an amazing experience. Pages could be written about his influence on horror movies even today. And more could be written on his social subtext with the 50s "afraid of teenagers". But this simple little story of interplanetary horror remains a damn scary film of horror if you let it. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's ugly as if everyone was going out in our modern world. But "The Blob" is a scary film in which a bunch of kids hunt down the incredible creature when adults do not believe them. In fact, there are even beautiful dark moments in his world of candy colors. And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the deserved story on paper that we, the viewers, are really trapped and believe in him. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you can remove your postmodern ironic filter, there is much more to love here than it seems.
