I keep watching this movie again and again. I have to watch it at least once a week. I come from Africa and watching this movie taught me things that I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films are full of lessons for people from all walks of life. I wish he was my own brother. I also saw and loved your Masala Mississipi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to put his brother to work, it reminds me of my teenage age, while my brother was still angry at me because I had to be busy all the time. My brother has always taken care of my old father and he also wants to see me the same way. By the way, where did Denzel get that African accent in the movie Cry Freedom? I saw this film for the first time in Africa and I did not know at the time that Denzel was American before moving here.
