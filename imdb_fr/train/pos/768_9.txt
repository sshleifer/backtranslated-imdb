Cinematically, this film stinks. The same goes for the acting game. But <br /> <br /> I do not care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80s looked like (for many of us in the world) and what a hip-hop, Zulu nation, and break the dance was really like.Large music, great <br> /> <br /> dance! It almost looks like a documentary about a time when <br /> <br /> hip-hop was a way of life. It is also interesting to see New York look like zero after a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that it was a poor and dilapidated city <br /> <br /> in the 70s and 80s. the best of all the hip-hop / break movies that came out at that time. Of course, the <br /> <br /> 80s are now considered a joke with all the bad TV shows and <br /> <br /> movies, but those of us who have experienced it will always remember <br /> It's fondly for a time when music, dance and graffiti were fresh, yo!
