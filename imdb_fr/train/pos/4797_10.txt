I've always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film, Lynch has proven to the critics that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity to make movies apart from the surreal aura for which he is become known these last ten years. Even though the film is rated G, it is purely Lynch in style, stimulation and tone. The film moves with a masterfully hypnotic rhythm and is full of scenes of emotion and authentic power. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic, as one might expect from a Lynch movie, and the transitional editing sequences are breathtaking. It's also very refreshing to see a movie where all the characters are friendly, caring people and not helpless characters, clearly labeled as "good" or "bad". <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth turns into a beautiful one just like the rest of the cast, including Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance in the role of his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but critically important role . <br /> <br /> With this film, David Lynch was critical that he could make a powerful moving film like in the '80s with' Blue Velvet 'and' The Elephant Man '. Critics seemed to lose confidence over the last ten years after producing surreal films such as "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway", but with this film he showed that there was a way of working to FWWM and LH, and it seems that critics have finally understood his latest film, "Mulholland Drive," considering the praise he has received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" is for me one of the most moving films I have ever seen. It's a love story about family, friendship and the kindness of strangers. I highly recommend it.
