I arrived late on this show - believe it was the third and final episode of his first broadcast - and was blown away by a social comment that has not been seen on American television since "All in the Family ". <br /> <br /> Was very surprised by CBS to have even launched this in the first place. <br /> <br /> It's just to say that the last time CBS "had a set" - if you know what I mean - was back on "All in the family" day. The most controversial decision they're ready to make today is the amount of makeup for Katie Couric's eyes. <br /> <br /> If you really want to annoy a group of people, let them discover truth about themselves. And if you want them to be willing to pull the strings, call and have a work of art removed, let them discover that truth by hearing their own words from their own mouths. <br /> <br /> The Aardmans have always been well ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. In a way, he was sneaking under the CBS 'corporate / social / political / censor' radar to make it appear on the schedule (maybe the big guys never really looked at it). that it is finally broadcast?), saw themselves being - well, can bet that the message, or the messenger, will not last long. <br /> <br /> Now, if only the "missing episodes" can find their way to Usenet or bit ;-) <br /> <br /> Thanks BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
