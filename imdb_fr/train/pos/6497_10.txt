I had to see this a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I saw her for the first time in black and white on the local television station PBS. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD game that kids will be able to see and watch. They do not teach history at school, which explains the most critical event of the twentieth century. This expands their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Impartially, participants from all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why, it details what led to the war and the current war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your kids with Alistair Cooke's America. Look at them with them and make them understand. You will be so happy to have done it.
