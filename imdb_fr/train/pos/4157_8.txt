This Anime movie debut was rather a good movie that I caught once on the Science Fiction channel, while Anime was popular in America, not because of the hearing disaster that an adult is trying to swim. Frankly, I think it has less to do with the fact that it is less popular and more with the fact that people now prefer to buy DVDs are watching uncut episodes on the Internet. This film probably did not have many cuts and the work on voice was acceptable for a dubbed film, although I prefer to watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use rather annoying voices for children in all that is doubled. This film features a young boy on a train called Galaxy Express hoping to get to a planet with the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered by a robot who hunts humans for pleasure. During his adventures, he became friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as with a woman who looks like his deceased mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, like most women in the movies, anime, has a secret that could be really good. for our young hero, or really bad. He also travels from planet to planet when the train makes several stops and meets a space pirate, Captain Harlock, who apparently played in his own series of cartoons. The Galaxy Express is therefore in this universe. All in all, it's a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending. There would be a sequel to this one, but it was not as good as this one, but the end was a bit more final than it was here.
