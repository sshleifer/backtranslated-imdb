With all the violence on television and in the local news, it is refreshing to have a program devoid of violence or adult language, while remaining entertaining. My kids can not wait to watch with us every week. Each of us has his favorite boss and his favorite judges. We all appreciate Elton Brown. We love to learn about the background of the main ingredient, vegetables and unique seasonings. We play at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's a good time for entertainment and information. Better still, in our breaststroke life, it's an hour that the family goes together.
