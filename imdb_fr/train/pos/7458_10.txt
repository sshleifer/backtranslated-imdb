This game is the bomb and it's the 007 game of the year and should be on the biggest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but Nightfire came in and it was better, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time, it's a 3rd person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. He even has all the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as James Bond again, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M (forgive me if I spell it badly). This game would be the same as the biggest James Bond game. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10/10
