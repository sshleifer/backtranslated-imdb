This film fascinates with its beauty and creativity. A deep vision of the artist, his art that flows intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring Hosanna, mixing his creations with trees, white water bumping against rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy gives to the viewer the happiness of living, aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious land. He does not spare us his occasional frustration, but on the whole we see the miracle of joining art to nature. Our thanks also go to filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and perfect timing. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste for beauty, nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic movie!
