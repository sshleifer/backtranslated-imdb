The 60's is a well-balanced mini-series between historical facts and a good storyline. In four deliveries, we follow a North American family of three members. But we do not only see them. We also follow the story of several characters as Black Reverend, Extremist Student Leader and Soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is just amazing. In the first chapters, we see images of the Vietnam War between scenes. The next chapter does not start where the last one ended, it starts shortly after, leaving us a little mysterious about what happened. In general, the 60s mini-series is a must, not only for the fanatics of the hippies, but for all those who have little curiosity about it.
