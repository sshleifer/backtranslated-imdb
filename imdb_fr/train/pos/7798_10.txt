I can not begin to describe how incredible this movie is. I'll just say that every time I'm depressed by the way things seem unfair or frivolous, it's the movie I'm going to praise for putting myself in the right frame of mind. The background music makes you aware of ease of existence and simplicity that provides the greatest happiness. The young Indian girl who sings is only one example of a character in this film who does not try to strive and who is happy. Persifina, Ruby's colleague for laundry (Ashley Judd), is another eye and her smile could make the person's day the most difficult. I watch this film and I dream of better days or a good conversation with friends. I realize that staying alone - Ruby is often alone - is not the same thing as feeling lonely. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull in a movie.
