OK, this movie begins as a cheesy movie and hardly improves before. The scenario is full of "cheese" and "fluff" and the distribution is not well directed for the most part. During the first half of the movie, the little girl nibbled my nerves. I do not think this is one of her best acting roles. The only reason I bought the film was because it was on sale and Ellen Burstyn was on it. She's great but it's also not one of her best performances. The story is based on real events and it helps the film. In fact, I did not even like the movie at first, and I was disgusted when I saw still images of the balloon traveling, I mean ... it must be where it is supposed to go and finish it! But everything is forgiven when he reaches his destination and at the end of the story. If you do not cry, nothing will do it! It's cheesy and predictable, but it also makes you feel good again in the world.
