Even if the film is sometimes a bit long, it is worth it. Gordon leads in a style reminiscent of Vonneguts' writing styles. Merciless, thoughtful, ironic, offbeat and dark, this film will stay with you for a long time, asking for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is also wonderful, in a role that will remind our Lynch fans of her Laura / Maddy days. Do not miss this one!
