I found this movie very exciting from the start. When Miss Stanwyck begins her narration, there are only a few minutes left before you realize that problems are coming up. The deserted area, the door lock of the deserted gas station, everything prepares you to wait for it ... here it is. At first, you think it will be about the little boy, but too early, you hold your breath watching the rising tide. I found this film very stressful, even though I had seen it before and was ready for the outcome. Now, a movie that can keep you in suspense even after seeing it deserves a special note, maybe a White Knuckles award.
