My family watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the release of the movie. We have most memorized lines. I watched it two weeks ago and I am always moved by the simple humor and vision of life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a great job as a secondary coach, even though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie just makes me love watching movies. My favorite scene is where Arthur visits his fianc√©e's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father spit aside. The butler's line, "Do you want to wait at the library" followed by Arthur's answer, "Yes, the bathroom is out of the question", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" funny "!
