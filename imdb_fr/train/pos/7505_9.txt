If there's one genre I've never been a fan of, it's the biopic. Always misleading, filled with false information, scenes too dramatized and tricks all around, biopics are almost never well done. Even in the hands of truly talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. Skepticism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics going to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and moviegoers opposed Gretchen Mol in the role of Bettie Page, claiming she was no longer a celebrity and she did not have chops for the role. I never doubted that Mol could handle the role since, but I did not expect to be as blown away by his performance as when I watched the movie a few hours ago. Mol delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as an iconic 1950s pinup who, after a first life of abuse (subtly described and tastefully done, something few directors would likely do) inadvertently becomes one of the most discussed models of all time. The photo covers 90 km / h, but no less than three secondary subplots always give the impression that a small part could be missing in the story. Director / co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's fantasy scenario are marked only by a film that is too abrupt and not as clear as it should be. Nevertheless, the two ladies must be congratulated for having created an almost flawless biopic that manages to pay homage both to its subject and to the decade it imitates masterfully. When the Oscars come, Mol, Turner and Harron should receive nominations. I imagine that will happen, although there are certainly not three more deserving women. 9/10
