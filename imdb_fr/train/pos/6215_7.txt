Although I'm not a big fan of musicals, I loved the movies of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are so much fun. Of course, they can be a bit fictitious, but even if you know what's going to happen, they're still very nice to watch. Despite this, I was a little disappointed with this release. Part of that was because this movie does not have the wonderful support cast as you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be lacking a bit, especially in the "fun" department. The silly antics of these supportive actors gave the other movies a charm that FOLLOW THE FLEET did not have. In addition, unlike the usual character of Astaire, he is rather a fool, because his big head causes trouble again and again at Rogers. And, therefore, it is much more difficult to love him or want to see them meet at the end of the film. Also, although the music is from Irving Berlin, the songs just do not seem so memorable. In fact, none of the songs were so special and I do not remember any of them even though I just saw the movie. Even if it's a cute and interesting movie, it only misses the sparkle and magic of some of their other films. Good but not great.
