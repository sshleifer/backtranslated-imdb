I had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this film unfortunately describes a lot of them. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, as well as highly unfair. From robotic sex to the quest for gifts, to lies and betrayal, I lived in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: here are the reports of my three trips to Russia in search of a wife. It contains thousands of pictures of many hot Russian girls I met, black comedies, scams I knew and the story of my flight and my stint on Russian national television. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like reality TV. You will love it. I spent a ton of time putting it together. So check it out. The Russian woman Nicole Kidman plays is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photo reports. <br /> <br /> My three young women looking for trips to Russia are proving very exciting and selling, so why do not they make a film of my wife looking for adventures in Russia? However, there is a factual impossibility in this film, and this is the way the guy orders his wife to a catalog and has it arrive at an airport. It does not work at all like that, so I do not understand why the media likes to perpetuate that. There is not a single Russian bridal introduction website that works this way, and I challenge anyone to find one that does. The fact is that you can only order CONTACT INFO (email address, phone number, etc.) from the Russian woman on the website. From there, you correspond and you visit it. If you want to take him to your country, you start the immigration process at your NSI office and wait for months afterwards. That's how it works in real life. You can not just order him to arrive at your airport. American immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I got everything I wanted by going abroad!
