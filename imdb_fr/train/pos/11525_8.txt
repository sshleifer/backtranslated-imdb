This film is great for three main reasons. It's aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved that. Throughout the film, the theme of colors is daring, with extraordinary costumes and picturesque scenery. A photograph that looks very expensive (and probably has not been) completes the look. I still love these stories of marginalized / lonely groups who come together to become a family. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s but not this one. This group of actors really describes characters imperfect but extremely friendly. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, the van and the road movie theme, I could not help but remember my favorite film of last year, Little Miss Sunshine?). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and Til Schweiger's performance embarrasses me a little. The opening scene, all the scenes where they miss their turns are very funny. There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film. I really like the end. And of course, this is the magician's theme. A good magician makes the audience look where they want, to create an illusion. What happens is exactly what a movie director does and that's why they call it the magic of the movie.
