I'll start by saying this: ... Why, oh why, can not WB do what these directors do? Sandy is obviously an extraordinary director and deserves a credit from WB and DC. But I guess they're a bit worried when a man with a $ 12,000 budget can make a fan of superheroes drool. The World's Finest is one of the best shorts I've ever seen, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think choosing a Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a great choice. Let's face it, Superman is not a supermodel. It can be beautiful, but a GQ Stud, it is not. And I do not know what this guy was wearing that had been commented on above me, but Superman is actually quite sturdy (have you ever read a Superman comic?). I guess that fact alone touches me ... It seems to be such an obvious choice to have a superhero play a super mass rather than a pretty face. Same thing for Batman, Bartram is in incredible shape, and an excellent Batman ... I do not know guys ... If we gave him a larger budget, and his own movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be Neck and Neck. In the end, this is one of the few superhero movies with actors who actually watch the game. <br /> <br /> The acting game is also very nice. I do not know what everyone is talking about, O'Hearn is not that bad. He's damn convincing as Superman and Bartram ... Well, he's Batman. I mean, go people, this movie had a budget of $ 12,000, what did you expect? Everyone is great too, except that Two-Face seems a little crazier than usual ... But hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lois is very hot too. <br /> <br /> The special effects are just as cute. I mean, See Superman lift the car ... MAN! Compared to Grayson's "Tank" scene, maybe I should put this one on top of that, because Mike really looks like he's flying, and with ease. The Flying footage left something to be desired, but again, with a larger budget ... Oh, and he even used a Batmobile (it was probably a model, but it seemed damn convincing). <br /> <br /> In the end, the only drawback of this trailer is the lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible director and SHOULD NOT be part of a project ... But no, they will continue (like most Marvel projects) to only receive malicious administrators for fans and what makes them interest, and continue to produce these betting movies. Thank goodness, Superman Returns was a success or it would have been the end. World's Finest is excellent and, in my book, counts as a movie of superheroes.
