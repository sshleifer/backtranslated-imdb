In 2009, when we have a black president, the film takes on a rather powerful historical significance. For entertainment, I found this film engaging and disgusting. Of course, the blatant racism of the time took over, but I found incredible music and dance. In addition, it is rather nice to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy who is comforted by his mother. He is told: "Why one day you could be president". It was so ridiculous in 1933 that we made fun of him and thought he was endearing, charming and funny. The bulk of the film is a fantastic sequence of what the government would look like if it were run by a black man. They describe the government seats as a revivalist Baptist church. <br /> <br /> The fact was that I stumbled on this film one day it attracted me. It's really well done and very fun. I believe that if we can look beyond racism, we can see this film for all that it brings us. In fact, realize that not only is it not ridiculous to have a black president, but that this is normal, makes this movie all the more relevant. This clearly marks a moment in the collective consciousness.
