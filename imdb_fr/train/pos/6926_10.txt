The narrative affirms the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a brother-versus-brother struggle. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and justice. His brother, who plays the role of Dutchman Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally, is the classic burglar robber, a Western outlaw, sued by his brother for killing their father. The story unfolds in the western classic west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to remove their handguns from their arrival in the city, and the man responsible for the respect of this law and this order is the classical West. Lawman Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> Also present are characters as flat as those of the Western world, such as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged rider and the hooded damsel in distress. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype of this film, the one that gave it its name, is a custom-made Winchester rifle. The weapon can be considered as an allegory of the rewards bestowed on those who do things with honor. Once stolen from his rightful owner, he brings a tragedy to anyone who comes in contact with him. In this sense, it looks like other icons such as the Holy Grail in Raiders of the Lost Ark and the stained letter of blood in Saving Private Ryan. This gives the film an element of surrealism that is generally absent from Westerns, a genre not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a revenge movie, he shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the villains of the film interpreted very effectively by Dan Duryea, kidnaps a woman after killing her husband. The volatile cowboy plays with the tender-footed husband and flicks it like a caricature of a cat playing with an insect before biting his head. Waco Johnny Dean ends up understanding what happens to him after coming into contact with the sinister Winchester rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 evokes Jason's mythological tale and his quest for the golden fleece, as Argonautica told in Apollonius. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object with a kind of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character jumps from one adventure to another in search of a unique prize. Another Winchester '73 theme that resembles a mythical tale is the fight between brothers. Several ancient stories deal with this issue, such as the story of Cain and Abel in the Hebrew Bible and the vulgate story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> As for the theme of kidnapping and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, he is present in many mythological works, such as Ovid's rape told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a fine example of the Western genre and serves as an objective correlative for many classic themes of the American West and ancient mythology.
