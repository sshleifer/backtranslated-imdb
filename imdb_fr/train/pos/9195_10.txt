I do not often give a movie or show ten times, but this show has touched a nerve in a way that no other show has. I found the entire series on mysoju.com and thought that the premise was interesting, so I took a look at it. I was not disappointed with what I saw. I was moved. This story remains tender as the main characters move us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, played thoughtfully by Koyuki, shows us the human nature to the extent that she wants to prevent trouble appearing. Nobody really wants to put their soul in front of a partner in perspective. So, instead, she substitutes a human, played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This animal is like any other creature we consider an animal. The difference; he can replicate the same way, after all, Momo is a man, not a dog. Since he is treated like a pet, he reacts to situations that can make a dog react. She spends time with her new boyfriend, Momo is jealous. It's when she realizes that her pet is not just a pet that the sexual tension between the two begins to thicken - Momo is a prodigy of dance. His thoughts change slowly as we begin to glance at his own thoughts. Matsumoto leads us to see a character who is very one-dimensional at first, two-dimensional when we see that he is a dancer, to a three-dimensional character when we see him begin to fall for his master as a man, not in as a dog. In my opinion, it is interesting to watch this story just to see this character develop. Plus, Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness that you're just starting to want one too. Neither of them wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo says (the name she gives him as they would call their new puppy) ?? we both knew it could not last. Watch this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
