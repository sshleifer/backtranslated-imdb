This film is a must-see movie for everyone. Congress should see this truthful documentary from the soldier's point of view, like everyone else in America. The previous comment totally missed the goal - it's about revealing the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who simply live in the "enemy's" territory and what it made to the soldiers. We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY before another person is killed or injured. It also shows that the government is not helping its veterans, those who are mentally injured, with post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost members. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
