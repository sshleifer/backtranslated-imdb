Beautiful James Stewart, vehicle Vera Miles. This historic film about the FBI is so good, it's the family aspect involved in a career of 35 years as described by Stewart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film traces the history of the great investigative agency. It deals with bombings of aircraft, the killing of Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gains, the fight against organized crime, Nazis and communists in this order. The human element is never far behind since Stewart marries Vera Miles. They raise 3 children and Miles' heart goes out every time Stewart goes on a mission. <br /> <br /> Look for Murray Hamilton's brief but memorable performance. Years later, he appeared under the name of Mr. Robinson in "The Graduate" in 1967. <br /> <br /> The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He certainly brought the FBI closer. <br /> <br /> It is true that this could be perceived as a right-wing propaganda, especially with Stewart's actual Republican views, but it is well done, historically informative and the family so well represented.
