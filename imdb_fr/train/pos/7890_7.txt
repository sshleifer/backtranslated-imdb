Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) by Freddy is the latest film to feature Freddy Krueger solo (and not as an entity or co-star). The years of massacres have had a negative impact on the city of Springwood. The small town has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago all paid the ultimate price. Only the crazy people live in the city and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that does not prevent Freddy from seeking his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time, he learns a little more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddy for good? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to know, you will have to watch Freddy's Dead. the end was initially filmed in 3D. <br /> <br /> An appropriate way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he can go out with a lot of fanfare! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger play the main role in this last part. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the last but it's filled with some dated jokes. If you like the show, do not miss this one. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy fans.
