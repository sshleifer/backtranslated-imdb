When I was a child, it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. Elderly people have often told me that Johnny Weissmuller was "Tarzan" and I would not understand why, since I saw some of Weismuller's last films in the character and found him rather fit. It was not after many years that I came across "Tarzan and his companion", then I understood. Weismuller is fit on this image and has the presence and ruggedness of the character's requirements that have not yet been matched by other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> Regarding this film, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, lively, active and "anti-inhibitory" woman of Jane, very in advance of the time when the film was shot (Tarzan she finds herself naked in a pond while she is amused, one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and, although she does not kiss him in return, she lets it do a little without doing anything, such behavior was unthinkable with the upcoming "Janes", such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all playing a kind of vulnerable women, too perfect, making difficult to believe that they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. <br /> <br /> The shining personality of O'Sullivan's character robs the show to Tarzan himself, except of course with regard to the action and Weismuller easily takes the lead; Another highlight of the film is Cheeta's secondary role and not her main role, as in Tarzan's last photos, where she often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and his companion" is an excellent product of its kind (Tarzan films) and perhaps as the best, although I must confess that I also liked "The greatest adventure of Tarzan "(1959), made with a larger budget and a strong support team (and despite the acceptable Gordon Scott in the lead role with his physique" any gym "too perfect that does not suit a rustic monkey man). <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her boyfriend!
