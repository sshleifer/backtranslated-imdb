It's a little original film, and I have to admit there are some weird actors too. <br /> <br /> He follows the adventures of a young man who decides to become a famous Las Vegas. illusionist, and partly consists of following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the difficulties of showbiz. I thought the movie was charming and that it has one or two moments of real magic that are worth it. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is great as the magician who never existed and Max's mentoring promotes it. a funny and touching relationship. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies on the trip, then I think you'll like this one.
