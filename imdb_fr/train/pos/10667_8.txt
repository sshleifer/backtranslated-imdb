I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I like the Broadway musical and I like the movie. I watched the movie as if it were not related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies. So I developed a philosophy very early. Suppose the film will be based on the book (or the musical in this case), but that even if the plot is similar, it will not be the same, but it will be different, so watch it. > <br /> I danced for 12 years before having to make a choice. I was a good dancer (singer in local productions when I was a child, etc.), but I was not very talented. I was however very talented as a show rider. My dance instructor and coach (whom I spent several months a year at his farm outside the state) told me that I had to make a choice when I was 14 years old. I had to go dancing at a quarter past two. days a week and riding 3 hours a day, 7 days a week .. and devote to one or the other. So, I really like dancing and I like this film and many other ballet and dance movies. I just chose to watch this film as it is. It's a fantastic movie about raw emotion and human interaction. It's the power of anticipation and sorrow when you work hard to get something you want and you do not get it. I love the movie I love the Broadway musical.
