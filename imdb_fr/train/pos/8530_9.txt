I do not know why he does not play Peoria, apparently, but it's a very funny and intelligent British comedy. It is at the end of the "Roaring Twenties". Peter Sellars is fantastic as a rich womanizer. Goldie Hawn, who plays perfectly a 19-year-old American girl in London, is at the origin of Sellars' "catch of the day". But the gastronomic critic of urban television can not help but fall for the American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, superb scenario, impressive performances of the leaders and the caste that supports it. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and the best gag is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try, you will love it.
