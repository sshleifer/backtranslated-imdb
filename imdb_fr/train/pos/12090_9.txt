I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in the basement of my parents on a Saturday night. It was shown on "Chiller Theater", a feature film about the fear that I watched religiously when I was young. Now, I've seen a lot of old horror movies through Chiller Theater, but none have ever hit me like "Macabre Dance" or "Blood Castle". I'm 51 now and it was only last year that I was lucky enough to find a relatively recent DVD edition of this supernatural chilling classic, after thinking that I would never get to the meet again. I have watched it four more times and I can not seem to have enough. <br /> <br /> They're just spooky movies like this one. Haunted catacombs and mist-covered cemeteries just do not work as well in color as they did in black and white during the day. Anyway, this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, haunted castle ensembles deliciously dark and wrapped in cobwebs, worried minds reproducing their deaths ... and a terribly ironic ending. <br /> <br /> IMO, this one is among the titles of "The Haunting" by Robert Wise, "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr) and "The Others", more recent.
