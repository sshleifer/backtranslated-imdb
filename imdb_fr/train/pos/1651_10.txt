I watched the presentation of this film on PBS in the United States during its first broadcast in 1988 (?). Assuming that the miniseries is available on DVD, I bought the first editions of the three books last year. Since then, I am looking for the series on internet movie sites. Today, I found this website. I will give up the search. <br /> <br /> I too would like to buy this complete series - 26 episodes - a miniseries. After buying the DVDs, I read each book and watched the episodes of this book. That's what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas ranger trilogy. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions about great books or series of books that have become very good television series or television series that are available on DVD?
