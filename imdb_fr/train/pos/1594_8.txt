What I like about you is one of those series that you need to see but you will not see, the beginning is cool and it sucks you in the series just for fun, the second part of the season 2-3 which is more bland, they come and go in what you want. what happens with a lot of series is that they do not end up with anything special because the second part of the series always falls in the drain, this one also did it a little bit, the third part is the one that spoils and ruins the whole series, usually, but it's not the case, this ending is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly, in fact I was quite angry with all these guys in the life of Val, in fact I wanted to finish with Jeff in the end, but later that changed, they chose to take Vic in the series after almost three seasons without him, which was the biggest surprise and also allowed the series to rank at the top. <br /> <br /> See her many times, the show is really cool Do not expect the second part to be as good as it is, but the third part does what was necessary and turned the series into a series that was worth it, I'm happy to say that I was happy and happy with the series and now I'll go see two guys, a girl and a pizzeria, when I get saw the whole series, I will come back ...
