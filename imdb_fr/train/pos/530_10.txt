The great talents of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger are remarkable in their wonderful "A question of life and death". This was part of the recent tribute to Mr. Powell at Walter Reade in New York. This film, in particular, shows us one of the best British films of this time or any other era. <br /> <br /> "A question of life and death" has a brilliant cinematography of Jack Cardiff, a man who knew how to do wonders with a camera. The contrast between the monochrome tones of the scenes played in the sky and the colors when the game returns to reality is particularly impressive. It was a coup d'etat, and well ahead of its time. The black-and-white footage that involves the long staircase where Peter and the conductor argue must be one of the most amazing things in any movie. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot of talk about this film forum, so Our commentary will focus on the great role that Powell and Pressberger have taken from the big, distinguished cast, which has beautifully responded to the directors' advice. <br /> <br /> David Niven is Peter, whose plane is touched and his best friend dies. This film was one of the highlights of Mr. Niven's career. He was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this film. Kim Hunter is surprisingly good in June, the woman who spoke to Peter as his plane had just dropped from the sky. As fate would have it, Peter and June fall in love with love at first sight. <br /> <br /> Some of the best British film actors honor this film with their presence. Robert Coote is Bob, the man admitted to heaven, but he is surprised that his friend Peter has never traveled with him. An excellent star tour by Marius Goring, who as a conductor 71 steals the film. Mr. Goring, who worked with the directors, is one of the best things in the film. In addition, Roger Livesey, as Dr. Frank Reeves, makes one of the best appearances of his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is perceived as Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> "A question of life or death" is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude towards its creators.
