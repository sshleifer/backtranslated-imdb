I must say that from the beginning, when I watched the movie Stargate, I was not blown away or anything that looked like a medium-sci-fi movie, with a lot of potential, although the film is not as unbelievable. like other sci-fi movies such as Star Wars or aliens, which, if you're a fan of science fiction, you'll admit that one of these two titles is incredible, even though I'm not as hardcore as the others, I'm not Remember a line from any of these movies, I'm not a big fan of wearing Star Wars t-shirts, in fact, if you saw me, I would look like a person mean for you, ah getting a little far from the point here, well my point is that you do not need to be a fan of science fiction to love this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 seasons extraordinary, without its quality deteriorating as it nears its end, in 2006. <br /> <br /> Although I do not really like the film, I was eager to start the first season in 1997 , and let me tell you that the special effects are just one of the chemistry between the characters just impressed me p ar special effects. They were as good, if not better, than most science fiction series released today. I must admit that I would never have gone into science fiction without Stargate, and my father, who actually introduced me to science fiction at the age of 6, and I'm glad he did it. I have never seen brilliant shows like SG1, which, in my opinion, is the benchmark for almost all science fiction series and movies. Basically, if a new sci-fi series is not better or as good as SG1, it's not worth looking at. Basically, it's the best science fiction show to date, and if you do not watch it, you have no idea what's missing!
