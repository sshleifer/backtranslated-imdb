If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you will end up with a fantastic comedy. In the current state of things, I always found that it was a very good film, which is not a small task considering the coma in which I was put by the opening scenes. To put it mildly, this film has a monotonous beginning that was not even funny, nor even optimistic. Once things get dumber, however, you end up with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades. This is definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a young fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see their previous work.
