The British horror film was in definitive decline in the early 70's, but three films are among the best products on our island. The Wickerman, the blood on the claw of Satan and the house that shed blood made the future more promising, even though many people knew there would be more. THTDB has the kind of cast that could easily form a wish list, if it had not been really assembled, in the dark backwood of 2008, you could expect to wake up. Waxworks is the most neglected of the four stories and is, of course, my favorite, Cushing's life and art are so closely related that you can not tell where the performance ends and where the suffering begins. One can only guess how this role affected such a gentle and sensitive man. Death and the girl. RIP Peter.
