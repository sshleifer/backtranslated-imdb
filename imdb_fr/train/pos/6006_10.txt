When I saw this as a child, it answered all my questions and dispelled all the fears or misconceptions I had. It is easy to watch because it is animated, which makes it non-threatening. There is no moral bias or "preacher" aspect, so no one should object. It's a nice film that simply summarizes the facts of the rules in a reassuring and realistic way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
