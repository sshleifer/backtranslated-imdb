It's an important film. This challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There is a lot to love here. The director seems interested in dismantling some of the most tired movie conventions. Unlike many recent American movies, this film focuses on what it means to make a movie. The DVD contains many additional features and two comments explain the film to viewers still confused after a first viewing. When the film was screened at Sundance, many members of the audience were uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night party movie. For the dedicated spectator, it's a treasure.
