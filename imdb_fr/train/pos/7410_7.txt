I came across "Shower" in the foreign film section of my local video store and I passed several times since because its cover, it looked like a farce or a comedy. I then had the chance to buy a copy at an economical price and I am happy for my luck. "Shower" is the story of three (3) men, a father and two (2) adult son, each facing life changes while the world around them continues to change in modern China. As in many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fascinating features of Chinese local color, this film is the tough but touching relationship between men and women involved in the story, all in the decoration of a bathhouse village. <br /> <br /> The history of the family goes to the remoteness understanding and made me happy to have gotten to know these people. In addition to the main story, there are many little characters, clients of bathing establishments, as well as their conflicts and their individual friendships. "Shower" is a film that one avoids smiling and is touched by its warmth and humanity.
