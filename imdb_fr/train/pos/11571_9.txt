"Itching Time" is part of a series of home-based circuits that Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s, including "Horton Hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Wings By A Lare". Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated chaos, it's basically the saga of a flea that is breaking ground for a new home, and the dog whose ground is being broken. Because Master Elmer will give him a dreadful flea bath if he does not scratch, the unlucky canine is forced to spiral out of turmoil while the family chip uses picks and power tools to clean the "earth". In the end, the little monster turns on the fuse to a small mountain of powerful explosives that he piled on the back of his victim! There is a tremendous explosion, and the poor dog covers his eyes as his background explodes in a flamboyant show on July 4th! It really hurts, and the dog takes flight, but he soon stops the action and says with a cheerful smile, "You'd better give up, because I think I'm starting to like it!" For years, this perverse confession has been censored, but current impressions have restored the clip, so that viewers can now enjoy it in its original evil glory. However, the last gag in which the cat blows after complaining is still cut. "Now I have seen everything! It was an ordinary gag at WB, but has since been purged of this caricature and several others, including "Horton".
