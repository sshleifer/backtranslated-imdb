It's a really funny, light and light romantic comedy. You can not go wrong with the beauty of Meg Ryan combined with the genius of Albert Einstein. Normally, I'm not a fan of fictional stories that are completely made out of real people, now dead and unable to defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein could have laughed at it himself. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a pretty, young mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is about to marry a fool, a behavior researcher named James, simply because he has the head she seeks in the future of his father the children. However, it is love at first sight when her car breaks down and she meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). As she does not think Ed is smart enough, her uncle, Albert Einstein, plays the match-maker, assisted in his efforts by three playful buddies, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must give Ed a decent appearance, so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist ... naturally with amusing results. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self, and draws Einstein's character completely effectively. With his three teacher friends, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, a lot of laughter ensues. The real Einstein had a real human side and this film is just a step further (scandalous). If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story is happening! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite her main character), but it is a wonderful and refreshing movie. One of the best of the romantic comedy genre.
