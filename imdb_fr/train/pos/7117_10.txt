This film is a fantastic movie. In my opinion, everything was there, from acting to staging. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on video, if not DVD. That being the case, why is not it? A friend recorded it for me, but it would be great to have it on DVD. For special reports, they could have said that a naval historian was talking about the battle and that if the wife or son of Mr. Schmid is still alive, they could also be questioned. Anyway, it's a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it is broadcast, hopefully, it will not be colorized. In my opinion, the colorization would ruin the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was pretty realistic until 1945, the movie would go. Mr. Garfield did a remarkable job in describing Mr. Schmid. Some actors may have been tempted to overlook Mr. Schmid's disability, but I feel he has understood everything. I sincerely hope that they will release this film on DVD one day, in tribute to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other navies who sacrificed so much for us during the Second World War.
