The television series Bewitched of the 1960s owes its idea to this film. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did just after their casting in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. This one is not as obsessive as this one, but Novak is equally captivating. <br /> <br /> It was the tenth film of Jack Lemmons, who supports him, just like Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this film, with support almost as good as it was in The Music Man. The distribution is very solid. <br /> <br /> This movie has a New York look from the late 50s and a cat as fascinating as any cat in any movie. It's definitely worth watching because it's a love story with all the emotion of any, and a bit of magic too. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo but I think because he watched this movie, the viewers did not rate it as well as he deserved - I'm glad that William Asher saw it, for the series of the 1960s to be created. I'm not very happy about what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is better than that.
