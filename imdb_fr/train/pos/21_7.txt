It may not be a memorable classic, but a touching romance with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the disastrous consequences on the career and life of any unfortunate person without this essential skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who meets a coworker employed in her factory work, an illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley. Iris discovers that Stanley is unable to read and, after losing her job, she gives him reading classes at home, in his kitchen. Of course, as you can guess, both, although initially suspicious, develop feelings for each other ... Jane Fonda skillfully embodies Iris, a woman who has her own problems , who work without prospects, two teenage girls (one pregnant), one unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrait of Stanley, intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, bringing dignity to the role that imposes respect. They are not your charming young typical yuppie couple, as the on-screen novels usually describe, but a middle-aged couple of working class with pretty down-to-earth struggles. <br /> <br /> I will not give the end far, but it is a beautiful comforting romance and a personal look at the troubling problem of adult illiteracy, even from the point of view of a fictional character.
