I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store at the time. I have always been a big fan of Weird Al and when I saw this video, I rented and watched. I was too young to appreciate all the satire and subtle humor of Al at the time, but I remember it much later, when I was old enough to understand what I was looking at. If you are a fan of "Al", especially from his previous work, you will really enjoy this movie. It's done in the "Rockumentary" style of MTV-esque and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al came to where he was in 1985. You'll love it if you like his humor and more importantly, his music.
