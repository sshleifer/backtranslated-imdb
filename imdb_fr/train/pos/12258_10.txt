Emma from Jane Austen is an extremely pleasant story in the worst moments and this production is the best I have ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is irreproachable. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography) is able to bring out comedy effectively, she fails to make Emma pleasant. Paltrow is not helped by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "wrong" for the party (and I think at the time) and she looks really bad in the dresses of the empire line. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, handles comedy effortlessly and is always able to show what Mr. Knightly (Jane Austen's most romantic hero) actually sees in her. Mark Strong is a beautiful Mr. Knightly, who combines elegance, age, chivalry, compassion and kindness. Emma and Mr. Knightly are supported by a troupe of good actors and the production as a whole is rather pretty.
