Rather a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time that your biopic dragged on, this fun and fabulous movie has the look of the time with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie type movie. I think the trend would be to portray Bettie Page as a kind of sexual vixen, like a Jayne Mansfield. But if you really watched Bettie's poses, she always seemed happy. Not a haughty look "you would like to be with me", nor the look "I'm just doing it because my acting career did not work" of a porn star. And so, the ladies involved in this film (three producers, a screenwriter / director, a co-screenwriter and the charming Gretchen Mol, who, I'm sure, have helped shape this role with her own sweet influence) have really captured the idea of ​​a sweet, naive southern girl who really liked being photographed and hoped the good old JC would not be too angry with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol achieves a high level career (she may have the most perfect breasts of all time), which I am happy with because she had the spell. Several years ago, she made the cover of Vanity Fair while no one really knew who she was, touting her as the next girl. And let's be honest, it was a little presumptuous. I mean, unfortunately, she never achieved Gwyneth status, but not for lack of talent. Making some bad film choices when you are a pretty blonde in the Hollywood style makes you forgetful, I'm afraid. If it does not put it back on the list, I'll be a monkey's uncle. <br /> <br /> Intensely private, Bettie herself has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the pin-up party on a positive note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever floats your honey boat. You were a woman from hell. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Mary Harron, you have done justice to our cult idol.
