I love how this game can literally blow you from your seat while you play it. The way the screen jumps and blinks when touched is very realistic, but you should also remember that this is just a game and you are not really there. The sound effects and the sound are incredible. There are many different weapons and spells to cast and you can even choose which spells make you stronger or not. You get this stone that can knock down the enemies while you recover mana to do more magic to your enemies. The best part is that, all the time you play, you are really nervous and you are afraid of what might be hiding at the next turn or what could jump behind you. If you want a complete experience, try playing with headphones.
