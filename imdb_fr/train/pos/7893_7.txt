I guess I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film. Is this one of the best of the "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had fun with that. Freddy Krueger reaches his perverse and devious potential. As parts 4 and 5 have somehow delayed the series, I had the feeling that what is called the final installment ("New Nightmare" is the real end) allowed the series to come out of its slump . There are some great nightmare sequences, including one in which Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets put in the trash, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. It's a very original and hilarious sequence, especially when you see it coming out of the dream landscape, hopping like Super Mario. In addition, Freddy launched the animated "One Great Liner". And since the film was shot about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb. Lisa Zane is perfectly in the lead. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man" and I think the last time I saw this movie was about 5 years ago. He is another great underrated actor who has a powerful screen presence. And who can forget the cameos? The best is that of Johnny Depp (the first "Nightmare") playing the role of spokesperson for an anti-drug advertising. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really great! So, for those looking to watch this movie, rent it or buy it on DVD! I hope all editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video editing has removed the 3D element. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have not seen many things that do not fit in the film. He even elaborated on Freddy's story. The film is an excellent mix of humor and fears, and the deformation effects are great. Could it have done more justice to the franchise? Of course it could have. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And in closing, I loved the editing compared to the opening credits. The fans of the series will be delighted and will see a tribute to Freddy. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
