"CASOMAI" was the last film I saw before getting married last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first film I was looking for after my wedding, because we had promised to give a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the reality is not the one outside fiction. To all those who wrote that priests like "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I would recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> To all the others, I would only recommend them to see this movie, before and after the "I do!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
