I have seen this movie twice or more and I found it well done! The Second World War had just ended and the so-called "cold war" was about to begin. This film could thus be defined as one of the best "propaganda" films, preparing patriotic films, preparing the Americans and, on the other hand, the inhabitants of the "Western bloc of NATO" still to be trained, to make facing the next threat. The film celebrates the power of the United States, through the centuries, while projecting into the current war, which had just ended. Fun and funny is the way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the nice "espisode" of New Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan to a local drunk Indian .. To see absolutely (at least once, out of curiosity of the propaganda mode through time)! :)
