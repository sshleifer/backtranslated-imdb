"Castle of Blood" (or "Castle of Terror") is a well-designed and surprisingly scary entry by Italian director Anthony Dawson. An exquisite black and white cinematography, a flawless dubbing, a superb cast, a fairly logical scenario, a deliberate rhythm and a surprise ending (although quite appropriate) distinguish this one. Only the movies, sometimes the hokey music and the rather brutal "love at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) walk in a surprisingly entertaining film. <br /> <br /> During his visit to England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub and tells one of his ghost stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young journalist, asks for an interview with Poe. During the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Incredible, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan that he can not survive that night at Blackwood Castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan can not afford the bet, so he's betting his life for a 10-pound bet. <br /> <br /> Unlike the "Black Sunday" superabundant Mario Bava (aka "The mask of Satan"), "Castle of Blood" is quite sober, making the few moments of violence even more formidable, which is particularly surprising on the part of a director usually associated with these terrible Italian space films of the 60s. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the only version of this film that I found is seriously deteriorated (and saved) pan and scan version. Even in this case, it is worth seeing and he claims a modern remake, with perhaps Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise's "The Haunting".
