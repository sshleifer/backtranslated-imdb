Personally, I could not enter "This is Not a Love Song", it's a brilliant film and there is a beautiful story, I just checked the time on my phone every two menus to see how much it remained of film. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, because there, they depend on each other to get along in life. At the same time, I would like the relationship to be more than it is. Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike Ibs is not in love with Heaton, or he does not know how to love him. Acts of betrayal on both sides have a significant effect on both men. They are both devastated by the fact that the other fled and abandoned them, at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
