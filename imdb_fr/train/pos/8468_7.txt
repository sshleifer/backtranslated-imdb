A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret with regard to its relationship with paranoia. There is a lot to do in this area for an execution time of only 74 minutes, but it works. The alarms are very subtle, not the alarms that seem to populate most of the recent Asian horror movies. The way the "scares" are configured is similar to the troubling moments of "The Uninvited" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but it's not at all the same caliber. The film does a good job balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. I would recommend checking if you have the opportunity.
