I saw this with few expectations and I loved it! Bend it like Beckham is a rather typical film about a girl rather atypical. This is the main role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), in which plays Jess, an English teenager who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (it's football we, North Americans) . And although she is actually much older than her character, she plays the role of pitch-perfect. <br /> <br /> It's a film about friendship - especially Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), his teammate who also leaves because of family problems, especially with his mother, who She wears purple nail polish and little knots on her shoes, and wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lace underwear and flirt with boys, and fear that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both like to play the game and find it difficult to convince their family to let them go in pursuit of their dreams. Unfortunately, they also love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes a certain tension in their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clich√©s. In others, the scenes last far too long and this film probably could have benefited from a tighter editing. <br /> <br /> But it was a fun and refreshing film about growth, cultural conflict and the love of football. It's about empowering women, pursuing your dreams and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie that could ... and who did it. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
