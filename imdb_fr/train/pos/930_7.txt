I'm sure most people already know the story - the miser Ebenezer Scrooge receives the visit of three spirits (the past, present and future ghosts of Christmas) that highlight parts of his life in the hope to save his soul and change. his ways. The classic Dickens story in one form or another has stood the test of time to become a beloved vacation favorite. <br /> <br /> While I grew up watching the 1951 version featuring Alastair Sims, I'm convinced he's the best Scrooge, I was impressed by this version, which was published when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a convincing and nasty Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors who play the ghosts are rather scary and threatening. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern shooting styles (for the 1980s), which makes it more acceptable to my children than the 1951 black and white version. <br /> <br /> It's a fitting adaptation of the story I look at almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
