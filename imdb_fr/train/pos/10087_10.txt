The fabulous costumes of Edith Head who painted them with the best on Liz Taylor! <br /> <br /> SFX is very good for a movie of his age, and the liners really looked like actors, even the type of body, a rarity in the movies of this vintage. <br /> <br /> A nice movie, with great panoramas - even after being cut into pan and scan.
