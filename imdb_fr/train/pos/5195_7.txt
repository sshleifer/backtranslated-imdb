As a fan of bad movies, I really touched Paydirt with this one. The plot is not that bad, but there are some cases where you really have to ask yourself, "What the heck is going on here?" <br /> <br /> There are many things that make this the funniest. bad movie ever. First of all, Rudy Ray Moore had become so big and so slow when the movie was shot that the special effects are to speed up the fight scenes to double the time. There are also scenes where there is an instantaneous slow-motion recovery, jumping on a wall three meters high (playing, falling upside down), naked men coming out of big letters, and sex that makes literally drop the roof (with the cable holding the roof burning). <br /> <br /> Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore movie would be complete without a totally free and random comedy club scene where Rudy mocks all the customers, interposed with people doing a strange dance. There are so many bad things in this film, but they are so entertaining and if you leave the film of the eyes, you may miss another mistake. <br /> <br /> Note: 1/10 for real value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for error and blunder correction, averages up to 7/10.
