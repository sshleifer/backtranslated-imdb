I attended Camp Chesapeake. It was located at the head of Chesapeake Bay on the North East River, Maryland. It was a similar type summer camp with cabins. It was created by the YMCA of Coatesville, PA. I started as a young camper, then became a junior councilor, senior advisor, then waterfront manager. If the camp had continued, I would have done everything in my power to become the camp director. Unfortunately, the YMCA's powers decided to close the camp and sell it to MD. A few years later, I went by boat to the old camp. I was dismayed by the negligence of the DM state and the natural destruction by Mother Nature. The 350 acre site has served so many people with all the benefits of contact with natures offers. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and guardians of the property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I idolized each of his beings. Even though he did not know how to swim, he was a waterman. If I asked him where the fish was biting, he would designate the place and I would have a bullet. There was also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me forever.
