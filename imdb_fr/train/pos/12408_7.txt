Viggo Mortensen plays a new prisoner in a haunted prison where the guard (well played by Lane Smith) holds a terrifying secret that could explain the killing of several guards and detainees by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and fears for his life. When I think of prison films, I always think of action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or high-profile dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect a ghost story closer to the Exorcist III. The prison, however, is an atmospheric effort and certainly remains the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The film is scary and has some good actors from a cast of strangers (at the time). Lane Smith is the best choice because his director is not the usual clich√© of evil personified, but rather nervous and nervous, which adds a certain credibility to a film that far exceeds expectations. <br /> *** out of 4 (Good)
