The SOLDIER is not as bad as many claim. I found that the film had some saccharistic and cynical humor like that of Starship Troopers by Paul Verhoven. The absence of dialogue and the one-on-one action are deliberate and add to the comic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A particular detail is important to me - Todd is named after several tattooed space war campaigns' TANNHAUSER GATE is one of those battles. For the more unconscious, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the last elegant lines of Roy Batty in Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside Androids like Roy is, to say the least, staggering. Maybe the screenwriter David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I will give this one 3 of 5.
