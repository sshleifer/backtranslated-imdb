One of the things that interested me most about this film is how the characters and their associated stories are developed on the fly. I suppose the writers wanted us to be interested in the characters by not feeding them forcibly. The principle of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a theme and / or a unique analogy for what families / siblings live in life. The complexity of having a twin serves as a surrogate father and even a husband adds a great deal of tension to make this movie emotionally interesting. Moreover, although the story is not directly related to the masses (that is, Jewish / binocular / family affairs), the themes are quite universal, with each family having a black sheep. It made him very attractive.
