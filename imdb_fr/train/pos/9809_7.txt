Randolph Scott travels to Albuquerque for a job with his uncle. However, on the way, the scene is blocked - even if they do not carry a safe. However, a nice lady on board is hiding $ 10,000 for her business and that of her brother ... and the thieves seem to know it. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle's home for work. However, he quickly learns that this uncle is an idiot - the naughty type of westerns. You know, the rich guy who just wants to get richer by cheating, stealing and threatening until he owns everything. And, it turns out that this moron was behind the theft. Scott asks his uncle to return the money, and then Scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is not the end of the problems, but the beginning. On several occasions, intrigues of different types occur in an attempt to crush the opposition of the uncle. One trick is to bring a pretty woman to befriend Scott and his partners. He is a sniper and it looks bad for Scott - until he understands why she came to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of Randolph Scott's latest movies, this one shows Scott as a more stubborn man. Too often, in his films, he is the last to suggest violence, but in this film, he does not hesitate to suggest a lynching (derogate from the law, let's be scared) and later, he quickly threatens the uncle. What a surprise to see him as stubborn - even though, in most cases, he is the same Scott as you expect. <br /> <br /> As for the film, there is nothing particularly unusual in it. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, the villain can not be reasoned and is finally destroyed and Scott gets the girl. Despite this very typical plot, everything is very well managed and is worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, the film contains two strange scenes. First, late in the movie, Scott and Lon Chaney, Jr., the uncle's henchman # 1, fight in the fist. In this movie, Chaney smokes while he fights. far as he gets kicked. Secondly, get a load of this crazy trolley scene with the whip - now THIS was an impossible feat!
