Light comedy, Nothing shows us a world we sometimes wish to escape: a world of nothing. Anything you do not like, whether it's a pile of bills, a bad memory or even hunger, can disappear as you please. They did a great job on this film and, with a very entertaining duet of stars, there were only a few things I did not like in Nothing, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> the post-credit scene (and yes, there is one): good for laughing, but what were they trying to accomplish with that? I was confused and anxious to see a return to something after all a movie of nothing. Instead, we hear a random assortment of noises and they scream. In my opinion, he is trying to create a suite, but it was not really necessary or fun after the turtle came out of the frame. <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD. and, as others have said, he is promoting a horror movie that never came. Oh well, mediocre marketing, I guess. <br /> <br /> If you see this in your movie rental store, take a look at it, because nothing is a good movie to watch. If you have a big screen, you may want to wear sunglasses.
