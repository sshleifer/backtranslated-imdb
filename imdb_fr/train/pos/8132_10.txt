I do not remember the first time I heard about this movie, but I rented it about six years ago and it's still one of my favorite comedies. I admit that you will probably despise this movie if you do not know anything about rap music. But if you're a rap fan, even casual, you'll love jokes and internal references. One of the best lines of the film concerns the difference between a b **** and a h **; I still use this line today and it makes me laugh. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who played the nerd Lamar in `Revenge of the Nerds'. It is unfortunate that this movie probably never came out on DVD.
