Elvira, Mistress of The Dark, is a fun horror comedy in which the fourth wall is broken several times and where jokes often stay under the belly button. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become characters apart. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a hostess of the stacked horror who learns that she has inherited her aunt Morgana. She goes to a small town in Fallwell, ruled by the most horrible monster ever to kiss the Earth: morality. The booby appearance of Elviras is of course too much for prunes, but the kids in town love his different approach to life. And of course, there is an even more sinister evil, his Uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), according to Elvira's mother's spell book. You see, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just does not know it. However. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira is a pretty funny movie, although the scenario leaves a lot to do. Most bursts of laughter come from the difference between Elvira and people of good character, but there are also some good visual gags. In all directions, it's fine, but it never goes up to be more than that. In all, a good comedy, intentionally camper. If you like that kind of thing, it is.
