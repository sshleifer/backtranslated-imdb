It's one of my favorites of all time. It's so simple and sweet - certainly a romantic chick movie comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and that's it ... one of my favorite is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters "Do you think I think" and Ed says "Now what are the chances of this Produce! "In my opinion, a movie is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and enjoy the same pleasure, and with it, you can !! I also really appreciated how Walter M. describes Einstein. I think all the characters fit together really well and the story is going well. There are so many times that I find myself smiling with the movie and quoting my favorite lines while I watch it! I would recommend this film to all those who have the heart and enjoy a romantic comedy well felt from time to time!
