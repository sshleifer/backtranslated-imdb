A trio of pals, sergeants all members of the British army, sneak and fight through imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they see the biggest and deadliest challenge of the resurgence of a hideous cult and its mad and implacable guru. Now they have to rely on the regiment's smallest servant, the GUNGA DIN water carrier, to save many of the Queen's massacres. <br /> <br /> More based on The Three Musketeers than on Kipling's classic poem, it's a marvelous epic adventure - an entry worthy of the 1939 Hollywood Golden Age. Filled with suspense and humor, while keeping romantic interludes to a minimum, he captures the interest of the viewer and keeps it to the conclusion (sentimental). <br /> <br /> It is virtually useless to discuss the nuances of performance of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as they are actually all thirds of a single body - inseparable and, at all purposes & purposes, indistinguishable. However, this does not diminish the pleasure of watching them spend a glorious moment. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note, in parentheses, that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished military career from the First World War, Fairbanks would have a remarkable record in World War II - mainly in covert affairs and winning no less than 4 honorary knights after the conflict, while Grant would work undercover for British Intelligence, closely monitoring the Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.) <br /> <br /> The real interim laurels here should go to Sam Jaffe, ripping in the lead role. He breathes to the humble man a radiant dignity and enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem sound. It is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is a strong man of the regiment, while Eduardo Ciannelli is a villain incarnated by the guru Thuggee. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote and Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. The film actors will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The film chooses its bad guys. The demonic worship of Thuggee, worshiper of Kali, goddess of Hindu destruction and soaked with blood, was the scourge of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritually strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840, the British army, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in definitively suppressing this religion. From now on, it would remain material to novels and nightmares.
