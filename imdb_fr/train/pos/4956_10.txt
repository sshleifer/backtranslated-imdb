This film is really authentic and random. It is very difficult to find movies like this one in movie groups now in Hollywood. I really like watching this movie. I bought his DVD Tuesday this week and I watched it 4 times. I love Paz's spanglish accent, it's really cute like her. And his game and Morgan's are so fun and natural. <br /> <br /> My film taste may be very different from the others, but I must say that I really like this film, the simple is the best! <br /> <I learned something more about life in this movie (well, at least in US life) ... life is really random ... Sometimes you meet someone, they miss out on your life and become your friends by chance, and you do not spend a lot of time with them, maybe just a moment, but you appreciate what you do with them, then you and them We will never meet again, but the time you spend together is truly unforgettable. Keep these moments in your mind as grateful and enjoyable memories ... <br /> <br /> This film may be cheap, but its meanings are not. I can rarely learn something from a movie, but it's an exception.
