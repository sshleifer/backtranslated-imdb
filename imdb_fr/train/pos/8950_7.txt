For those of you who do not know Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "underage" films of his career. And although it's not a good movie compared to many of his other movies, it's not bad and he spends enough time - but not much more. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch in New York and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her. Over time, the cold, detached woman, Mrs. Novak, also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently, in the witch's rule book, it's a NO, NO !! <br /> <br /> The film is strange in its sensitivity to witches. They are neither the sacrificing baby nor the almighty variety. Most of their magic is quite limited and useless (as for example Jack Lemmon who uses his powers to extinguish streetlights). And, very oddly, the witches all seem to be bohemians hanging out in trendy bars where you could find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz. Given what I think of jazz, it really must be a witch in the world of movies! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is pretty romantic and slightly comical, but it's not something I would rush to watch. The acting is pretty good, but the storyline does not yield enough to make this movie an exceptional movie. In fact, I almost scored the film at 6, it was really close.
