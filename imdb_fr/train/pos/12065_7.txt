"Insignificance" is far from a good film, a play directed by Nic Roeg. In Roeg's film scheme, this exceeds the level of most of her post-Do not Look Now works, characterized by the wise use of Theresa Russell as the lead actress. In fact, it is very good here and far from the problem of other Roeg films such as "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As "Actress", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, describing her as a depressive but sympathetic siren. She plays well alongside Michael Emil in the role of Einstein, who is excellent for the least. He looks great in the role, and although Theresa Russell does not exactly look like Monroe, she's certainly pretty attractive for the piece to sound right. The other players are adequate or even as attractive as Emil and Russell. Roeg runs a handy and smart script, but certainly not brilliantly, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other later films of Roeg, he tends to rely too much on vague and insubstantial flashbacks, which add very little to the film. In many ways, the film would have worked better as a shorter piece (say 60 minutes) and more modest. Still, a film quite acceptable, passable. Sometimes quite excellent, but overall, it is somewhat lacking. Note: - *** 1/2 / *****
