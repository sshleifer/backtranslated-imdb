SPOILERS small alert !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised to say it myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the name of the director, Deran Serafian, usually means bad news. Most of his films are less than average action movies, like Death warrant and Gunmen. It was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of acting. This film really fascinated me. Good achievement, seeing no famous actor nor big budget. It's really the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be satisfied. Sarafian sheds light on another aspect of Bram Stoker's famous story and remains fairly faithful to the truth. This explains the life of Count Roemen Dracula and how he scared the Turkish army by throwing dead corpses in front of his castle. Of course, this is where the reality ends and the "based on a true story". Bram Stoker invented everything to drink blood and everything else. <br /> <br /> In this film, the count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the United States and seduces tons of women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give it to him. Overall, good behavior of unknown faces, enough blood and blood to satisfy more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. This movie is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf of my local video store. But it's definitely worth cleaning the dust on the cover and putting it in the VCR. Heck, it's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films have nothing else in common, but I reproach this movie for diverting the attention of this pretty little photo. Check it out ... my humble opinion on To Die For = 8.5 / 10
