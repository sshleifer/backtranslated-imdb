I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They are more funny and better than all the other films together. They might as well have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but how could they have known there would be no good movies? Man this movie is good. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive a lot in a race car, and the lush Loni Anderson is at hand, she looks extremely hot since the eighties. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in advertising for a vacuum cleaner. I liked this advertisement! Plus, there's that part of the movie where the racetrack audience is upset by something that Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing and shows a guy from the audience who bends down and puts his finger on his back to show his disappointment! I laughed so much that I almost died in the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then, never look at another film, because I tell you right now: it is useless.
