Although not a horror movie in the traditional sense of the word, this scary little movie delivers the goods. It seems that a vampire is free in a small German city draining his victims of their blood. Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his leading roles, is skeptical in thinking that a mad killer not a vampire is getting lost. The only person who believes it is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), girlfriend of the inspector and laboratory assistant of Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill) who, although apparently a prominent scientist, adheres to the vampire theory. City dwellers suspect the lunatic Herman Gleib, played with his usual frenzy of Dwight Frye who seems to have a lot of fun with his role. The film contains a bit of humor, which helps to reduce the intensity of all murders committed. Among the amusing characters, Ruth Bertin's aunt, Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), thought it strange that Herman had not turned into a bat, but into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye are a good team of comedians. <br /> <br /> This budget film features elements from the film "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet". Dr. Niemann used the power of suggestion to make a sleepwalker, "Frankenstein" using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" since the murders are considered by all the world except the inspector and his daughter be the job of a leech. These elements are well mixed by director Frank R. Strayer with a bit of comedy. The concoction works. The restored version that I visualized used the hue to increase the phantasmagorical atmosphere. So, try to see this version if possible.
