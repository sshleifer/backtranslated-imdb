I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I liked the film so much. Two days before the screening of the film, I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" before the film and I thought I understood it all .. I was wrong: instead of a good movie, I attended a great movie! I felt the movie. it was sad ... it was funny ... but mostly it represented LOVE ... I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack ... so I will not do it :) I'm not a movie critic ... I can not describe it in more words .. My description a little vague is all because the game left me speechless .. thank you god for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Bis! :)
