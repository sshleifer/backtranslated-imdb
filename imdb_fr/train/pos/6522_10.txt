During all the madness of the Caribbean trilogy, Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball by restoring this film supervised by Anthony Quinn, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, and available on DVD and Blu-Ray, with all the extras included. It's obvious to me that Paramount Pictures executives are blind as bats and do not know they have a very good pirate movie in their safe on a real hacker who lived in New Orleans, Louisiana , which would have helped make The Crescent City once again famous for its links with pirates. When Paramount executives finally get the program and release the film in digital format, I'll be a good camper. Paramount Pictures, it's up to you to get out of your bag and have this movie restored now!
