A simple movie at the beginning, a simple movie at the end. He has this endless clich√© and pretender, but most TV movies have this possibility. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-rogue. The marriage between her and the woman for whom he works is, I find it a bit odd, but I believe that for the period in which he is defined, he is nonetheless credible. <br /> <br /> Now I saw the TV version mounted, although the movie was shot and shown on 'tv', I find it a bit weird too. But I think that if I saw the entirety of the work, I would give it more or less probably the same note. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still .... a good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
