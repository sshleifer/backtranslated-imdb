I really liked this movie. Kurt manages to act without speaking, letting the moments speak for themselves. He does not need to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action. It is supported by a good distribution of actors and sets and is able to show us a more human side of the soldiers without becoming nerdy.
