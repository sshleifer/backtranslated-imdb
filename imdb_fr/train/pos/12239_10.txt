Excellent stuffing! Which, of course, is all that it is intended for. Fortunately, there is no social message or political message, nor any attempt in this direction. Could the plot really take place or have taken place at a particular time or place? Unlikely, after all, it's just a movie, and movies are born of imagination, not reality. The only purpose of this film is to entertain, and certainly not to educate, and entertain with reality, with a delightful and slightly thrown reality. I think most people would agree that we expect documentaries of light and authenticity. But for entertainment, I want what is said nowadays as an "obviousness", what The Mating Game is in all respects. For some chuckles and a pure laugh from time to time, it's a fantastic dream.
