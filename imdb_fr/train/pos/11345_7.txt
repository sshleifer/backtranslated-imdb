That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying film (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> A boy leaves for a magical trip to an island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, is thought to be more like a triton with conjunctivitis, and a talking flute is targeted by a witch (Billie Halliday, considered at that time "a little comfortable" ). <br /> <br /> The flute is recovered at an "interesting" convention on witches, witches having an old gay time. The boy dresses in drag then in "fairy" to recover the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
