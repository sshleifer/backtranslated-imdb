This is another great movie I had the chance to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker and others). At the end of the 80s, I was a beginner in the genre and I knew very little about the big three JC, SH & YB. I did not really know what to expect when I paid my hard-earned money to see him in a "triple bill of classics" of ancient Scala. I did not need to worry, I was out of breath with this movie. If you are a Hong Kong Kung Fu / Action Movie fan and have not seen this movie, do it now!
