Who votes in these assessments? "Jacknife" is an admirably well performed and brilliantly watched work, with actors at the top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the incomparable Robert DeNiro (please do not mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of this man-see "Pilot" taxi "for confirmation of this point). Is it a "banal" film because there is no sex / meaningless action / nudity in it? This film deals with the complexity of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional momentum towards the end is heartbreaking. The party where he orders a young man in a bar to undress is a wonderful observation of how fashion and movies are exploiting tragic situations and the frustration felt by real men about seeing a young man dressed military uniform. While we are on this topic, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest movies of all time, one of the greatest filmmakers, starring THE greatest movie actor of all time, with the scariest psychotic gangster of all time, justifies Is it a bit more than average? GOING !!!!!
