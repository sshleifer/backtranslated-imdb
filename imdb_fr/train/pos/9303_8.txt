When watching this movie, you should note that this is not a normal movie. There is no real story, just characters, a gang of gangster characters that meet in perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just lie down and listen. The film stands out and that is why it is difficult to find a correct way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why user comments on this movie are so mixed. <br /> <br /> I am for a film love and recommend it to all those who like one-liners and things that differ from the "normal". You can not really put your finger on what is so wonderful, it's just a comical world where gangsters reign. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than once.
