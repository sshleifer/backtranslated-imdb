Cliffhanger is a decent police adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin, who made an admirable film when he directed this film about an expert mountaineer hijacked with a friend by a gang of dangerous criminals looking for stuff filled with stolen funds . the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as climbing expert Gabe Walker, especially in the action / fight sequences, but some of them are close to the most unrealistic line. For the sake of the film, however, I am willing to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon, is respectable as a secondary character in the film. The action / fight sequences are well executed, but as mentioned before, some are not very realistic, no matter how difficult you are. The climbing sequences are however very well done because instead of filming the whole film in the studio somewhere, the locations they chose were very real and the views of Ariel on the mountain ranges are wonderful and add a touch from reality to film. The dead are inventive while others are predictable. The bad guys are strong, but it would have been better if they focused on a more central center instead of having a lot of them. The rhythm of the film was a bit slow but the good takes over the bad in this one. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, you will probably enjoy this one as well. Overall Cliffhanger has developed the character with enough action, drama, suspense, excitement, thrills and good performances from the actors that make this movie worth watching.
