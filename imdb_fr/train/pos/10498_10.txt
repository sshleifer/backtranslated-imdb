It's a bit easy That's about it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clear and realistic, except that some of the barriers are in 2D, but it's forgivable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are beautiful. From conversation to SFX, everything is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The angle of the camera is sometimes a little frustrating, but the same goes for all the platform games, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I received this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and since then I have conscientiously obtained 120 stars over 10 times.
