A CRI IN THE DARK <br /> <br /> A CRI IN THE DARK was a film that, in my opinion, would offer a phenomenal performance by Meryl Streep and a solid film, even if there was nothing remarkable. This hypothesis comes from the fact that, apart from the nomination of Streep in the best actress category, the film has not received much attention from the major award groups. <br /> <br /> I hardly expected A CRY IN THE DARK to be such an exciting drama. -built at all levels. If you ask me, it's an underrated classic. <br /> <br /> The movie begins rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain at a relaxed pace and really noticing that he is incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) chooses random moments to capture a family on vacation that gives imminent meaning to the impending tragedy, while showing the caring happiness with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain take care of their children . <br /> <br /> While the famous line "A dingo took my baby!" has become a bit of a typing line these days, the movie is never almost laughable. The real death of Azaria is captured horribly. It's subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on Chamberlain's ongoing struggle to prove his innocence to the press and the court. Lindy suspects of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the lawsuits all the more striking. As a member of the audience, I was totally invested in the Chamberlain's fate ... and I was really angry, hurt and saddened when the media made them look so bad. But at the same time, the opinion of the media / public is understandable. I loved the way the media were nice, but they always had good reasons to defend their point of view. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film is very deep and perfectly illustrates the central element that makes this film so different from other audience dramas. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, the only ones that really matter in this movie are Streep and Neill ... and they keep their promises. For me, this is part of the best performance (if not # 1) of Meryl Streep. Despite his mastery of different accents (which are of course very impressive), Streep never loses the heart and soul of his characters. I find this to be one of Streep's most subtle performances, and she gets out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and seductive in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is without a doubt Neill's best work to date. It's a shame that he was not recognized by the Academy as a lead actor to match Streep's movie ... b / c they play each other brilliantly. <br /> <br /> More captivating than most movies, and incredibly suspenseful ... A Cry in the Dark far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend to people who only know the movie the movie where Meryl yells "The dingo took my baby!" Watch the movie and see how much is still left at A CRY IN THE DARK. <br /> <br /> ... A ...
