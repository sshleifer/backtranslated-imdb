The obvious parallels between the charming fantasies of Walt Disney Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty obvious. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks with Mary Poppins, although the same creative talent was used in both Disney films. <br /> <br /> Like The Chronicles of Narnia, some English children leave London. during the blitz and come live in the countryside. And these kids have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis, Rawlins' children have the magic that invades their world and help defeat the people who ruin it here and now. No retirement in an imaginary kingdom like the Pevensie children. <br /> <br /> No philosophy based on the heavy duty here of Walt Disney, except maybe it's not a good thing to waste time with witches even apprentices like Angela Lansbury charlatan like David Tomlinson. Mrs. Lansbury has not become one of the most bankable artists for nothing. She wears her own magic that even Disney's special effects boys could not surpass. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in this department for this film. <br /> <br /> Two interpreters bid farewell to the Bedknobs and Broomsticks films. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film. She has honored many films in the UK as one of their most beloved music hall artists. And this great actor, Reginald Owen, as a retired general who runs Old Home Guard at the war and auction sings farewell to moviegoers around the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and helpful one here. The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but was lost by the Shaft theme. Personally, I like David Tomlinson's tribute to Portabello Road, one of the most colorful streets in London. <br /> <br /> Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fantastic movie that still stands well after 40 years. Imagine what it would be with computer generated graphics.
