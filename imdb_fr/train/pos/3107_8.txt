Resuming just after Moscow's supremacy showdown, it's Bourne's greatest adventure and its final climax. The film takes Bourne from Russia to Madrid, Paris, Morocco and finally to New York. Damon is every inch imagined by the impetuous murderer Robert Ludlum, he is the deadliest spy of the cinema at the moment, and it is the deep emotions of his character that make him so credible, and that's exactly the way Damon manages to combine these two polar opposites of himself that are breathtaking. In this third stage, Bourne's mission is to save his soul and, while observing it, Ultimatum offers such a performance that you sweat and you are out of breath about his powerful branch of ideas and pull-offs; simply watch for two superb car chases and a battle scene as realistic as Bond vs. Shaw in 1963. The director Greengrass outdid himself with this compelling thriller, probably as thrilling as thrillers; a real benefit for Bourne fans and a new generation of espionage-thriller standards.
