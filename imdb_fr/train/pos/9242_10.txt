It's hard to rate movies like this, because are you evaluating them in production or just having fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie around 1988/89 when I was a kid, and I'm sorry about it. let's say it started a fascination for life with ninjas The plot is pretty awful and the acting is of course terrible, but there is some mysticism surrounding the ninjas in this film that creates a good atmosphere. What is important is the fight scenes, even if a little, are really good. <br /> <br /> I must say it was better when I was a boy, it's only now that I can see the glaring points of an incredible nonsense in the film, but as a film martial arts "sit down with a few beers", I can not fault it, it delivers and is much better than the mountains of waste "American Ninja" Style that was brewed in the 80s with hundreds < Dusty Nelson, screenwriter and director of Sakura Killers, directed another ninja film under Bonaire's flag, "White Phantom". I do not know if it should be a continuation of Sakura Killers ", but the Sakura clan is once again a main feature, with the same logo and a similar story, but this time with a White Ninja. while being disastrous, there was a bit of atmosphere, but the fighting scenes are even rarer and, to be honest, they are pretty awful. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a fan of martial arts, so have fun killing a few hours!
