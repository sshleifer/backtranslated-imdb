Good luck finding this movie to watch even - it's not out on cassette or DVD yet. When it was released in the early 70s, I was lucky enough to be able to film it thanks to the preservation efforts of the American Cinematheque, and there are still some concrete moments that remained for me until I was thirty. precise comments here. As the outgoing director shortly after the resounding success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N would have managed to best manage the low-budget efforts, and this is certainly reflected in the wanderings and meanders that could have been used. But it is also a memorable icon for its time: the very intense clashes of university sport of the late 60s, student movements, the sexual revolution, etc. <br /> <br /> Why see this movie? In some scenes, it was probably a whiplash: the dashing bonds between men in showers after the match; Karen Black's scene with Tepper in the car will take you a bit off guard - but it's the first use of a word I'd never seen in a movie before; and the occasional and unexpected use of nudity in general. I probably omit others. <br /> <br /> Look for the pretty surprise of a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; a David Ogend Stiers thin; Mike Warren fresh out of his powder blue uniform and preparing to wear a dark blue uniform for the television; Robert Towne - Actor; and many people just play themselves. <br /> <br /> Now: Any connection between Harry Gittes' name, Robert Towne, and a certain Chinatown character and the Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> He gets a "7" based on Karen Black. You'll see why.
