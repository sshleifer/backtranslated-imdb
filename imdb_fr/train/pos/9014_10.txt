Shamefully, before seeing this film, I did not know Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to do research to make sure she was not really affected, like her character, with (well?), what she was distressed. I was in the absolute admiration of this beautiful lady. She removed it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the last desires and needs of a single young woman could be interpreted as being tender and romantic? Well, they can be when the good performers present them in the proper way, as they did in this wonderful film. I forgot to mention the dynamic beauty of Miss Carter in this movie. I have often said that she was the most beautiful creature to have honored the face of our earth, but she seemed to have managed in this particular film. <br /> <br /> I hope anyone watching this movie enjoy it as much as me. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
