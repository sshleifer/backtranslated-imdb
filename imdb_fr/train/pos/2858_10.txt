Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker and even Guy Williams (the cousin who was brought for several episodes in 1964 to replace Adam when he left the series). The actors had chemistry, and they really seemed to love each other. This allowed many of their weakest stories to work much better than they should have. He has also transformed many of their best stories into great Western dramas. <br /> <br /> As in any show that turned more than thirty episodes each season, there must have been weak ones. However, most of the time, each episode had an interesting story, a kind of conflict and a resolution that did not usually include violence. While Bonanza was a western, the armed fight was never presented as the main attraction. While I'm a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; these shows usually ended in a shooting. Clashes were the way many Westerners resolved each conflict, and Bonanza was very different in trying to find peaceful solutions and harmony instead of killing. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza, some interesting episodes a lot of shootings. These episodes contrast with the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the series, Guy Williams was appointed to replace him. Williams played the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay one more year and that's how Williams was eliminated from the series when he moved to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had remained throughout Bonanza, one can only wonder about the improvement of the series beyond 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the series. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, once Pernell Whitaker left the series, the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. Whitaker had often played heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid, and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. As Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, it did not leave much room for any shootings. <br /> <br /> At one point, they hired a ranch hand called Candy (David Canary), who became their fourth member. from the cast, but Candy was never featured in any shootings, and it was little more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two, they also had Ben take another lost cousin (Jamie, played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel), a teenager who usually had problems with someone. <br /> <br /> Apparently adding the teenager, the studio sought to attract younger viewers. It also gave writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, delinquency, and so on. This type of preaching episode was popular in the 1960s as a reaction to established media against counterculture. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of television on public order, although Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. and many other shows have also tried to keep up with television shows featuring irresponsible teens causing harm, malice and crime. <br /> <br /> Adding a teenager to the distribution has given the Cartwrights more chances to show resolve and solve problems, but these episodes are very artificial and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker's death, the series was lost for about a year before being canceled. The last season was pretty bad, in which Little Joe was tracking down his wife's killers and most of the episodes were a bit depressing because he drank or remembered how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was. she was killed. <br /> <br /> I do not think I have ever seen the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they've ever officially sealed it in one way or another. Last year, there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) actually living on Ponderosa, Adam being gone (and never coming back once) and Hoss having passed away, Little Joe having left after his wife's series) had been killed by dinghies. <br /> <br /> Overall, the era of 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left, he slowly declined. Most shows before 1970 are also very good. By 1970, this series was trying to be fashionable and topical, and it did not have much Western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenager also diluted the overall quality of the show and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the last blow. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes produced, at least a hundred are excellent Western dramas! It's a very good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than many other TV shows.
