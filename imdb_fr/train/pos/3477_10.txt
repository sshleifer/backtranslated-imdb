Some people think that the second series was marked by the ruin of Scooby. I absolutely do not agree. The quality of emissions has not decreased or declined, gain my opinion as a very good corrector. I looked at a survey on jumpedtheshark.com. 72% of people said that the second series of Scrappys was the fall of Scoobys. OK, so many said yes, but 28% still can not go wrong. I like the way most episodes are devoted to comedy. Even 5 people / dog solving the mystery in the same formula. Scrappy was a breath of fresh air for the show. Of course, some people were listening, but when Scrappy was introduced, he watched DOUBLED.Back at the show. .i was intrigued by the yabba shorts and. But at the end of the day, it's a matter of opinion, whether you like the battle or not, it's a matter of opinion, there is certainly no fact at stake. But in my OPINION, this gave a start to tire showing a new formula and lease of life. Nuff says.
