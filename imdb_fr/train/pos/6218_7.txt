79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have only done great movies together. Although it's not one of the best, it's an excellent musical. There are some outstanding musical numbers, a good support from Randolph Scott. Two remarkable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, are memorable performances for the first screens. Ball is particularly good, and a blonde too. "Let's face music and dance" is one of the best numbers of this musical duo. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" plays Ginger Roger's sister. The basic plot is quite familiar, but with such an exceptional cast, it works. Excellent artistic direction and score.
