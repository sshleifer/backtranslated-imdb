I must be honest, I was expecting such a serious failure, because it really sounded like we were trying to take advantage of the original film to get money. But that was not the case with this rather funny film (sometimes strange). I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba. The story of Simba and her sleep difficulties was funny. The hot tub is bubbling and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's a harmless pleasure, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will take some time because it is pretty good for a movie directly on video and DVD. Although the film looks a little strange and stays a little late, it works. 8 out of 10
