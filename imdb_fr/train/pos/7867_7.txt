Madhur from CHANDNI BAR started making realistic movies, which some called dry <br /> <br /> He directed SATTA, a movie as realistic as film, but a great film <br /> <br /> The film of his formula that flopped <br /> <br /> He returns with his superlative PAGE 3 <br /> <br /> A film that plunges into the life of journalists and it is a brilliant film <br /> <br /> The film is well told, although the half-cooked romantic portions of Konkana can be avoided, but this is forgiven. <br /> <br /> The whole track of Upendra Limaye is superb too <br /> it's great too <br /> <br /> The dial between Manoj Joshi and his friends is funny at first but sometimes repetitive <br /> <br /> The sub-plot of Bikram-Tara is brilliant, as is the entire scene of the hospital and also the last child abuse that shocked you <br /> <br /> The movie has an open end that is well managed <br /> <br /> Madhur does a great job Music does not matter <br /> <br Konkana excels as Mad havi, using her best Tara expressions Sharma is decent except his voice Sandhya Mridul is good as usual Upendra Limaye excels in his part as a cop, one of the talented actors Unfortunately, it is not well used today Atul Kulkarni also his little part, Boman Irani, is sober and does a great job, the rest is fine
