The third and final installment of "Hanzo the razor" is the most concrete of all. The "training" is even over in the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation of loan traffic by an order of blind monks. He also makes a historical comment on the proud rejection of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where Hanzo's first film was just a funny and bloody ride with little connection to his plot, "Hanzo 3: who got the gold" manages to connect everything, and finally brings it home. Definitely the perfect finale. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there is a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (that's * Hanzo the razor after all).
