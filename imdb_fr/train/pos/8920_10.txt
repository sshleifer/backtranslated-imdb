I was not aware of Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew that I was very scared to go see this movie. (I was devastated by the movie "Trantula" at the age of seven ... But I was ten now). The first scene where the Blob crawls the farmer's probe stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater. But I stayed and I suffered every attack from our monster. I felt such horror when Steve and his daughter barely managed to get out of the doctor's office (poor doc), and even more so when The Blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large part of the audience. . . so much so that its oooooozzzzzz out through the front doors, too huge now to get through just one. It seemed indestructible and his unlimited growth potential, and when he trapped poor Steve in a sieve-like dinner, it seemed like a real dinner. <br /> <br /> To say that the blob was cold would be a modern description, but in the end, colder than to scare and mentally break the little children. <br /> <br /> I remember going back home. evening with my uncle Nick, trying to act bravely. He knew I had problems, and when I went to bed that night, I could not only feel the blob in the room, but also when I had the courage to look down, the red guy throbbing hungry, waiting for me to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I'm 57 years old now. . . I did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the blob has not been destroyed.
