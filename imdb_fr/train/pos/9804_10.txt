"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is about as entertaining as the Batman animated movies. <br /> <br /> While remaining faithful to the spirit of the comics, the animation is made with a lighter spirit than in the animation. series. Bruce Wayne is a lot like what he was before, but now he looks a little less imposing. Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by Tim Drake Robin, younger and less nervous. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as usual, invokes Batman's voice better than most actors in real life. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice job than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in the movie Batman, the movie lives or dies depending on the quality of the bad guys. My favorite, the penguin, is here. His drawing is more refined than it was before, more sensitive to the representation of the 60s by Burgess Meredith than that of Danny DeVito in "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice. The Penguin is ultimately described as a cunning sophist, just as he appears most often in comics. The voice of Hector Elizondo creates a much more memorable Bane than the forgotten version of "Batman & Robin". Finally, Batman has a mystery to solve by handing the "detective" into "Detective Comics" (that's what "DC" stands for after all.) The mystery revolution is deliciously furtive. <Br/> <br /> The score adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the film. It looks like a mix between the score of "Poirot" and that of "Mission: Impossible". Overall, it's more fun than your average cartoon.
