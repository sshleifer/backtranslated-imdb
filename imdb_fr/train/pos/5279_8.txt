I will not repeat everything that has already been said by other viewers of this film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is excellent, and not only as a very human story of the relationship that develops between a father and his adult son, but also as a small window to the world of the practice of Islam, for those who like me do not know this religion very well. <br /> <br /> An important aspect of this story is that of The young man's relationship with his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude to religion seems to change in a subtle way as and when as we progress in their journey with them. <br /> <br /> C well done movie that I would recommend to anyone with brains and heart.
