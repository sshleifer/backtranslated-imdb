We recorded this when it was broadcast on television in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release, which has quickly become one of our family's favorites. The children are now teenagers and have had to see him a million times, but they still watch him religiously with friends. Its timeless appeal touches all age groups - similar to "Grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander charming and wonderfully light on his feet. I noticed that other commentators on this site are quite hard on him, but our family gives him the best grades. (We loved his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) provides us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just flew flat. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Kim Chynna Philip's performance was a disappointment. Part of this has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. To complicate this, Philip's performance is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and simply awful. The director should have seen that and corrected it. Or never throw it to start. <br /> <br /> Overall, the photo is lovely and I highly recommend it to families of all ages.
