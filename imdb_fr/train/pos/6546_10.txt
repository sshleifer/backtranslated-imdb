I'm probably one of Nancy Drew's biggest fans. I read all the books three times and I played lots of Nancy Draw games. I loved this film. It amused you all the time you watched. I went with about 10 of my friends and everyone loved it. There were three women sitting behind us who seemed to be between the late '30s and early' 40s and I asked them how they liked her, they said they loved her! So you see that it will be an entertainment for all ages. You just have to give a chance. And that also gives a lesson, just be yourself, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. So overall, this move was great. I will see it a second time now! So stop hitting it please. It's a very good film!
