I'm going to tip the scales a little bit here and say that I enjoyed that. However, the drawing will only really interest those who have very absurd tendencies. This is certainly something most people will not understand, as is the nature of absurdism. <br /> <br /> The animation is horrible, but yes, that's the goal. The main character is rude, violent and stupid. no quality that redeems whatsoever. his wife screams and moans, seemingly barely capable of basic communication skills. most of these stories are completely devoid of any point. <br /> <br /> but here again this is the point;) <br /> <br /> If you are a non-sequencer, a foul language and a complete and absolute random character, you will love it. <br /> <br /> It is really short, so I would rent rather than buy.
