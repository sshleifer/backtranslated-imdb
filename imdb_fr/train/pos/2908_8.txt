A journey of discovery, this film traces the life of a family living in a sleepy island town in British Columbia. Both languorous and dreamy, the inhabitants are content to let life unfold around them until a young and fresh young teacher, with new ideas, arrives and comes from the continent. Slowly, their indolent state awakens, the father (and the principal of the local school) seeks enthusiasm, the mother's stability, the eldest daughter's love and the youngest power. Although it is not an incredible or revolutionary film, the film is pleasantly pleasant and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt that anyone outside Canada will find it easily accessible.
