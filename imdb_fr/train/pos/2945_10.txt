I watched this movie a few times in the 90's and I almost laughed at it every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this platform is something else. He is so funny. Even P.C. brigade would find that hilarious. This is a watch not to be missed, and even better if you have a drink to drink for guys or girls. The takeoff of Michael Jackson looks so much like it, if you close your eyes, you think it's him singing. The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously need a humble bypass if you thought it was not funny. My local video stores do not stock this video anymore, but I'd like to have a copy of it to show my husband and boys when they're old enough to enjoy humor. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.
