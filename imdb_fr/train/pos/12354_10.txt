A wonderful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors, such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes are locked on the screen and you only breathe the atmosphere of the film while waiting for what the fate will bring to the characters. This film makes you leave your position as a standard audience, it makes you come in, it's part of the story ... The costumes and sets are great; especially the okiyas district is skillfully built. It's certainly not very Akira Kurosawa, but the master still gives us a lot, especially the stylistic story that tells us that we are in a distinguished country of cinema that is far enough away from Hollywood flamboyance.
