This film is a harmless escape pleasure. Something was missing in the recent Tomb Raider movie. I can not wait to get the DVD. How can people give a low score and continue to see Titanic without a bad conscience, I do not know. Something with Karen Kopins in her underwear should note an extra point or two!
