Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It is a curiosity of the cinema, and is worth the detour. It's a live action mixed with animation, apparently influenced by Disney's legendary Song of the South, almost as if it were an answer to this movie. Philip Michael Thomas, who will later become Don Johnson's buddy in Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, best known for his role in The Shining of Kubrick, are prison escapees. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are Thomas's friends and intend to help him escape from prison. They are stuck at a roadblock and Crothers tells Thomas the story of a black rabbit, a bear and a fox moving south to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is lively and offers a lot of wonderful things to see. Like all Bakshi movies, most will be annoyed and will not like the animation. Real animation fans will forgive his bullying and fall in love with his inventiveness. The film is very violent, very sexual and speaks mostly of battles between races. For a long time, I thought I was looking at something extremely important, but after a while, especially after looking at it, it started to look more like a banal blacksploitation movie, like Superfly. It's very sloppy and really does not say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? Whatever the answer to this question, Coonskin / Streetfight is always worth the detour, for both animation fans and moviegoers alike. 7/10.
