<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, even if it's funny if you do not get the references, it's pure comedy. <br /> <br /> I have not seen much of the CB4, very excited, but what I saw does not have the heart that this little stormy has. <br /> <br /> I have not heard from anyone since, which is a surprise. The movie is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think a lot of dialogue, though invaluable in Tap, is more fun here, probably because I love rap more than rock. nowadays it is therefore my personal judgment. cloud this point. <br /> <br /> Rap songs are funny, and this is the reference for most movies, they are not all in front, which means the physical comedy and the one-liners have priority over takeoffs. <br /> <br /> Fun, watch it twice if there was a movie.
