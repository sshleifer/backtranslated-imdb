This fantastic whodunit is a first prototype of what has quickly become a very popular genre of film. I was happy to see William Powell handle a crime novel with charisma and charm, without the idiotic attitude of his character Nick Charles (from the series "Thin Man"). Although the story is good in itself, I think what really makes this movie fun is Michael Curtiz's fantastically imaginative direction. From a visual point of view, it is a film with a rich texture, where Curtiz shows an incredible mastery of the medium; From split-screen images to strange camera angles and imaginary flashbacks, Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors. Highly recommended if you are a fan of this type of film.
