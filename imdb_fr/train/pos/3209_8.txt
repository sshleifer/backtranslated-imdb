Interesting mix of comments that would be difficult to add something constructive. However, I will try. It was a very good action movie with some great scenery. You will notice that I specified the genre. I did not criticize the lack of characterization and I did not criticize the acting. Enjoy if for what it's people, a movie of action well above average. I could go on but I made my comment.
