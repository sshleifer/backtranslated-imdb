This is the story of Australian commandos who were captured without their uniform after a raid. As they are in uniform, they are rightly treated as spies. As such, they are tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The Japanese court martial, admired for its heroism, authorizes the death of the warrior. Of course, under the Bushido code, it means that they must be beheaded. A destiny to which, as Westerners, they are not prepared.
