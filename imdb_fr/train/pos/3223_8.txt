Ok, basically, it's a sci-fi sci-fi movie, but it's obvious from the start that it was done with a lot of intelligence. You can count about 10 shots that the movie is building, but it only delivers three, and two of them have a twist that lets you know once again that the director did not assume that you are an idiot. Kurt Russell's acting is really superb and brings a surprising and enriching depth to the character. Recommended if you come to see something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
