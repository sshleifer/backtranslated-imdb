If the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the film as the musician wanted to do with his music, they succeeded with me. The ordinary human situations became original, personal and immediate, so that I felt personally touched by each situation. I think I would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person who writes the film. Without spoiling, I can say that I was very moved by the approach of the movie's life. Have not you really cried of joy? empathy? just a deep emotion? in a very long time. I would like to find a way to show it to others. I saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
