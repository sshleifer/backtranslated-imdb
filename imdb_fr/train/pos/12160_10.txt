A largely underestimated black comedy, the most beautiful of a series of great puppet movies to follow "Baby Jane". Reynolds and Winters are the mothers of youths convicted of murder (a nod to "Compulsion") who fled to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for aspiring film-goers, a band of hilarious, talentless children frequented by dreadful theater mothers. Debbie, in her blonde wig ("I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies," she tells Winters) directs the toddlers in their concert and wins a rich father, Weaver. She also makes a delightfully funny tango and, overall, performs exceptionally well, unlike what she did before. The atmosphere is a good mix of comics and horror. It looks beautiful with beautiful period details (30's). Many beautiful shots in Hollywood and the terrifying movie. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a theater coach: "Hamilton Starr" purrs, "two r but prophetic anyway". See him and love him.
