SPOILER MINOR <br /> <br /> Stephen King's little underrated shocker. It's not perfect, far from it: even if the soft performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, it would remain the elements of the mystical story poorly managed. The old Micmac cemetery, Rachel's terminally ill sister and Jacob-Marley-an's Victor Pascow never really end up in a coherent whole, and the film in places seems confused and overloaded. But few horror movies are really perfect, and what it can miss in other areas is offset by its desire to shock. Pet Sematary is perhaps one of the most cruel horror movies of all time, with its deadly zombie baby and incredibly insensitive Zelda portrait. It's politically incorrect, it's tasteless, it's free - and yet it makes us shudder in a way that "safer" horror movies can never do. Add to that one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's spiritual direction, and you get an extremely satisfying horror movie - even with the hokey ending. Highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.
