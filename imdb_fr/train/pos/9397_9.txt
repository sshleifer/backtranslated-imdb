Vaguely reminiscent of 1940s westerns, such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story about conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a Texas Texan boy, discouraged and honest, who goes west in search of work and money. He finds both, but not as he had planned. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the film contains many surprises and twists. An excellent cinematography, a clever film editing and a morose Western music add tension and suspense. The expansion of the great country sky offers a beautiful setting. And the acting is good to excellent, with excellent performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country / western song gives the film a solid finale. <br /> <br /> Properly labeled as Neo-Black, "Red Rock West" also seems to be something else. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing, so others might view the script as flawed. Usually, I would agree. In this case, however, when one associates the moody atmosphere with the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal everyday life, coincidences and improbable timing suggest a story that, beyond from "black", is ... surreal. It's almost like fate deliberately intervening in unlikely events to force Michael to take charge. From this point of view, coincidences are not at all script faults. These are elements of conspiracy necessary in the nightmarish story of a young man who has to face his own demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Serling, in a postscript, explaining, in his voice always clearly stated, this ... a young man, looking for himself, stop in a small, almost deserted city, thousands of miles from nowhere. This is his last stop on a trip to ... the twilight zone.
