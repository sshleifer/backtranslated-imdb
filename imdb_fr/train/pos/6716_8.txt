Al Adamson, great filmmaker and filmmaker par excellence, really stands out with this horrific horror of an incredibly horrible science-fiction and soft-science comedy that plunges into deliciously gloomy and cellular depths. In the gloomy totalitarian future of 2047, sex was considered an illegal act by the powerless fool of the Big Brother controller, the Screamer (a funny clumsy Erwin Fuller). Sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (Catherine Erhardt, gorgeous blonde radiant) remains determined to change things for the better. With the help of her scary godfather Godfather (a flaming Jay, Campy Jay B. Larson), Cinderella attends a grand gala for the purpose of seducing the beautiful Tom Prince stud (dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and teaching to everyone that making love is a good thing. pleasant activity and quite acceptable. <br /> <br /> Adamson directs this ridiculous thread with his usual thumb incompetence, staging the incredibly awful song and dance sequences with a total lack of talent and talent. The appalling horror of "We need love" with people in absurd animal costumes prancing clumsily around the forest is a hilarious wonder; ditto the equally abominable routine of "the technical man" with a group of awkward robbing robots. The brutal, static cinematography of Louis Horvarth, sticky plastic miniatures, punchy and percussive disco of Sparky Sugerman, copious and free nudity (the gorgeous brunette hottie Sherri Coyle deserves special praise in this department), the silly attempts to puerile (Roscoe) Law Enforcement Robot is particularly irritating), and the consistently terrific performances (Renee Harmon's scandalously hammered portrait of Cinderella's nasty and dominant stepmother) further heighten the surprisingly plentiful cheesiness to savor in this deliciously delicious doozy.
