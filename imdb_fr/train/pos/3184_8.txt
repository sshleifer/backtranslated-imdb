This boiler filmed in Hong Kong contains more melodrama than "The Young & The Restless". This one is more like a return to the original trilogy "Emmanuelle" (in particular "Au revoir Emmanuelle") to a D'Amato blockbuster. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) underwent an astonishing transformation from an acute nurse to a fiery prostitute. Illona Staller, future Italian film star / politician, who would later be called Ciccolina (and would have sex with HIV, John Holmes) plays Emy's contest. Exotic locations and decent soft-core scenes complete this one. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am a part!
