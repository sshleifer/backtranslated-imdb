"What would you do?" is a question that will remain etched in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional palace of Brokedown. You will also wonder if Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - an issue that has not been resolved, and rightly so. It's a particularly well-played and beautifully shot movie. Although slow at times, its pace reflects the scenario - but much of the film will leave you on the edge of your seat; want to know what happens next. The end will also let you imagine instead of the main characters, brilliantly interpreted by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. The performance of Bill Pullman is also commendable.
