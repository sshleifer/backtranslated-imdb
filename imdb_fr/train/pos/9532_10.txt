I loved this film so much ... the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the breathtaking lighting and the cinematography, the magnificent soundtrack ... <br /> intensity and lightness combined touch that will not work for those who want the typical fast action movie. If we lived in the Elizabethan era, I would say that this film looks a bit like a Shakespearian tragedy. But as we do not do, let's say it sounds more like a drama-suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The film is intelligent in the way relationships and problems are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which, in my opinion, makes it more subtle and moving - and also suitable for a story based on a comic strip (or graphic novel). Sometimes, I felt like I was there in the 1930s, as part of this story: there was a quality that was both realistic and dreamlike in the style of his stories. <br /> <br /> I do not often prefer movies to the books on which they were based, but in this case I do it. (Although I enjoyed the book as well.) I bought the DVD, which is great because it contains wonderful deleted scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my little cousin, who is a little younger than the movie boy, to see him after seeing him for the first time because he has problems at home and I wanted to use it as a way to start a discussion about father-son issues with him - and the discussion.)
