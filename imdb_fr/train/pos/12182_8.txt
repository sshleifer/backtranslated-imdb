I did not research the film before watching it for the first time because it was part of a Welles box that I had recently purchased. A box that I mainly got because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and also reevaluate Waterloo. So, I put Orson and Rita in the reader and I am treated with class and confusion in equal parts. <br /> <br /> In appearance, the story seemed simple, the man meets a beautiful woman and saves a couple of thugs, they click immediately and the man gets a job offer for a cruise with a woman and her famous husband, her lawyer, then ............. <br /> <br /> ..well it becomes a mystery of murder plotted with diabolism and a lot of shenanigans Michael O Hara (Orson Welles) himself does not really know what's going on, he's as confused as the viewer, and it's wonderful to watch, because he is drawn everywhere by almost everyone in the movie. Obviously, being pulled to the heart by a femme fatale of such beauty that Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has her moments, but you just know that things will become pear-shaped. <br /> So many wonderful things in the movie, the visual style of Welles is ubiquitous, you will see a wonderful scene in an aquarium and the final sequences in a This fun house is majestic to the eye. O'Hara's narration makes fun of himself. A slight relief of the light thanks to a trial with Everett Sloane considerably illuminating the debates. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is a quirk, and it's actually a hectic viewing experience, because {as I had to find out after The studio heads cut the movie in about an hour, this which is not only frustrating for the viewer, but also unfair on Welles' vision. I am convinced that a complete original version of this film would have been praised and revered, because it is a very good and intriguing film, which unfortunately only refers to greatness, but remains an extremely captivating film that I am glad that I have to go back further. 8.5 / 10
