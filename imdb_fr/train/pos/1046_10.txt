Probably my favorite movie of all time, a story of altruism, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is neither preached nor boring. It never gets old, even though I've seen it at least 15 times in the last 25 years. The performance of Paul Lukas makes me cry and Bette Davis, in one of her very rare really nice roles, is a delight. As her grandmother says, children are more like "dressed dwarves" than children, but it makes them more fun to watch. And the mother's slowness to become aware of what is happening in the world and under her own roof is credible and surprising. If I had a dozen inches, they would all be "standing" for this movie.
