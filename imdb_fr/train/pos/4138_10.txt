Florence Rice is another reason to watch this charming movie. Florence who? This was my first reaction when the opening credits were posted on the screen. I quickly discovered who was Florence Rice, a real beauty who turns into a simply wonderful performance. As they all do in this striking set. From 1939, it's a different era, but that's where the charm lies. It transports you to another world. It starts as a light comedy, but it becomes very serious. Florence Rice goes from actress to heroine. She is absolutely beautiful, strong and vulnerable, and goes from girl to woman. Look at his facial expressions at the end of the film. She has made more than forty films and I'm going to get the thirty-nine others. Alan Marshal is Flynn / Gable and is perfect for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide great comedic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of the movies of the 30s / 40s, do not miss this one!
