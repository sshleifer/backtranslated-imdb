This film is not a kung fu movie. It's a comedy about kung fu. And if, before shooting this film, Sammo Hung had not spent a little time watching movies of the great French comic strip maker Jaques Tati (ie, especially of Feast Day), he is certainly on the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tati's movies are hilarious; but they are not of all tastes. Some told me that they hated his job. I never understood why, but I think it's because the character that Tati interprets himself is a totally dead character, so insensitive to the events around him (what he is doing) that many forget the more subtle details of the cartoon going on around him. him. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Tati's main shtick - or at least his best-known - is to take a pretentiously upright petty bourgeoisie in the 19th century and drop it into 20th century France. where it has to face a society this is largely defined by the gradual erosion of these sensitivities. He usually has serious difficulties with small things like turntables or radios. It's dangerous in a car, but the world is not safe when riding a bike. But through all this, he never loses his confidence, which follows from his recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> In the same way, the character played by Sammo Hung is himself a peasant who came to the big city of Hong Kong, absolutely convinced that what makes the city interesting is that Bruce Lee there shot kung-fu movies. This puts him in a delicate situation, because he is caught in an event that would never have been noticed in a small town but is considered inappropriate in a big city - like when he seems to be urinating in the street, 'stop, only to discover that Hung is just pulling water from his shirt, soaked during an accidental dive into the bay. What's interesting about this gag is why Hung does not understand what the cop is, in a rural town, so long as nobody looks, if you have to go, you have to go. In other words, Hung does not really urinate on the street - but he certainly would - and who is the responsible agent? Of course, Hung Lee's obsession with Hung Lee also puts him in big trouble. He beats a gang of thugs who refused to pay his uncle restaurant owner. Of course, in a film by Bruce Lee, the thugs would be considered as thunderstruck and they would have learned the lesson. But in Hung, Hong Kong, the reality unfortunately prevails and the thugs come back when he is not there to silence his uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hung ends up triumphing, like Tati. Characters like this must always triumph (at least in comedy) because they are completely innocent. So, despite their missteps and comical misunderstandings, they really represent the best of all the humans we admire and want to be. We do not really want to be Bruce Lee (who must live the loss of all his friends before he can defeat the bad guy), we, in our own innocence, really want a world where Lee's exploits are possible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this world exists only on film. <br /> <br /> "Ah, but if ...?" - and in this question, we find Sammo Hung at his best comic.
