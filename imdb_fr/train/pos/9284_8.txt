This film is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama describing the thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very amusing. much clearer than the dark and serious film of director The Circle (my favorite Iranian film). The resourcefulness of the girls and jokes between them and the soldiers was both quite believable (as if it were a documentary) and quite hilarious. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the match and its consequences were amazing. He added a realism a bit like Kenny from Australia, of course a very different movie. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls ?? were very credible. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks that Muslim girls wearing a chador are different from their own daughters should go see this movie ?? it will be a real revelation. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm. They started with standard official policy responses to all girls' calls. As the film progresses, they have more and more difficulty maintaining this position. When all that seems to be all Tehran bursts into celebration, everyone is trapped and the ridiculousness of current politics is obvious to everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected end. , and gave the film a very nice mix of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although it's adult cinema, I think that middle-aged children from the age of seven would really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read the subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran is able to produce films of such quality by the tastes of Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the constraints imposed require administrators to be extremely resourceful. Australian filmmakers (and others) could take a sheet of their book.
