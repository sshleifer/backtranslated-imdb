Thank the Lord for Martin Scorsese and his love of the cinema. <br /> <br /> It's the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented American artist working in the cinema, and I can not recommend it more. I have been captivated by all this and you will be too. Relax and let him take you on a tour of his world, you will love it.
