Most of the atomic age monster movies I saw on TV, and some of them, including THE BLOB, scared the light of day. Films like INVADERS FROM MARS made it clear to us that children should not be trusted when it comes to things like those that invade the home world; THE BLOB has just repeated this fact. I fondly remember late nights overhead looking at how Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs have infiltrated an unsuspecting society. There was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Va.) Was staging an atomic age classic every weekend. They were 16mm films, mostly in black and white (and the projector was noisy), and THE BLOB's "color" print had turned pale pink - but, man, it was fun. I dragged my mother and she enjoyed it as much as me. It is there, in this science museum, that I really fell in love with THE BLOB. The intention of the filmmaker was of course to make money - but it is the sincerity of all the actors, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (the actors), that made me fall in love with this film. Banal? You bet. Nerdy? They do not receive cheese. But, man, what a movie!
