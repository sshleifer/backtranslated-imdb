Personally, I disdain The Jerry Springer Show, however, I found "Ringmaster" as the funniest movie I've seen this year. The endless satire of Jerry Springer's "guests" that start in the opening scene makes you laugh all through the movie. Despite a brief scene in which Jerry Springer is weakly trying to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this film as entertainment value.
