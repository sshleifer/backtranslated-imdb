This is not Masterpiece Theater. You should not expect it. She is a pure FUN girl with the most fantastic cast of female characters. As someone else has said, here is the movie Baby Mama should be. And the only drawback I see in this film is that Tina Fey was not there. Plus, it features the brightest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is pure nonsense on the surface, but if you really look, you will know that it contains a lot of messages and a deep meaning for those of us who wish to be able to come back in life and do it again in life knowing what we know now. . PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of escape.
