I hated the first episode of this show ('Protesting Hippies' in 1999) so I avoided the rest. However, when he appeared on 'The Paramount Comedy Channel', I watched it all and, to my surprise, I found it absolutely hilarious (Motto: never judge a humorous series in its first week)! <br /> <br /> Established in 1969, Simon Pegg is portrayed by "Hippies" in the role of "Ray Purbbs", editor of the underground magazine "Mouth". Her friends are feminist Jill, the laid-back Alex and half-wit Hugo. In the late 1960s, young people were extremely optimistic: they could change the world by printing magazines that no one read. Rather than making fun of the naivety of hippies, "Hippies" is fond of her. Arthur Mathews's scripts humorously parody a number of icons of that era - "Hair", "Woodstock", "The Graduate", and even the famous "Oz" obscenity trial of the early 1970s. the distribution. Julian Rhind-Tutt's "Alex" strangely reminded me of Richard O'Sullivan's "Man About The House". It's a pity that there was never a second series, maybe because of people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', try it. Once you've had the terrible game, you're crazy!
