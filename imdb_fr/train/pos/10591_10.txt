We can not deny that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me, this film is one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico, in London, was discovered part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. We then follow the lives of the people in their struggle to keep the treasure found after the bomb blast and to prevent black market traders from realizing that, exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fighting against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration water and food to defend what is right. In fact, morality comes into play. It's when they lose all the food they think they've been beaten and they demand a surrender, so that all London reacts to their fate. by sending food, there are many. This allows them to continue their struggle. <br /> <br /> This film is the right note, the acting is superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren in the lead. It's perfectly fair, not too sentimental and the moral of the story is not imposed on you. Well worth a visit
