Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one but Mark Wahlberg chose not to wear the traditional loincloth. I hope nobody names him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in Planet's first two films, but Estrella Warren shows almost no cleavage - her hair is still awkward. Tim Burton could have portrayed this simian saga and given adults in the audience something to watch. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never goes out of her costume that looks like a big curtain. She's cute, but all the stuff of love is limited to anxious looks and a little kiss at the end. Like artificial intelligence, which deals with interspecies sex between robots and humans but never emits anything. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This film has three great actors, Tim Roth, Mrs. Carter and Paul Giamatti, who decorate the landscape as a trio of monkeys and they are fun to watch. Superlative costumes, sets and music (a certain Oscar) make it the 2001 summer film.
