As Peter Weir's first international hit, THE LAST WAVE is a mostly efficient cooler with a fascinating story based on an indigenous myth. Richard Chamberlain is doing a good job as a defense lawyer, whose life is becoming increasingly foreign to reality as he deepens a murder case involving indigenous tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide Chamberlin through the realm of "Dreamtime", a central alternative reality / chronology to Australian history and tribal customs. With an atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in its intrigues, the film ends with a disturbing finale somewhat mitigated by poor effects, probably due to budget constraints. Nevertheless, an intriguing film whose general impression of mystery and fear that lies just beneath the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will remain with you.
