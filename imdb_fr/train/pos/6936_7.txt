Winchester 73 has been praised by many critics for bringing back the western after the second world war. Director Anthony Mann must have a lot of credit for his excellent leadership. Jimmy Stewart does a great job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire are stealing the film with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the precious Winchester 73 to the winner. It's a good scenario with several stories happening at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as a young bull. Thank God, in a few years we would let the Indians play themselves in Western movies. The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson, Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but I get a higher than average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
