This movie was great ... it made me laugh, it made a mouth, and especially there are animals that speak! this film should be seen by all kinds of people! it's one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much that I just had to comment !!! It's a beautiful heart and a wonderful story that is a fantastic and sincere film! My favorite character is the shadow. It's because I think he's the most interesting and the most charming. I used to have a golden retriever like shade, I miss him so much !!! he was my best friend and I knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with all my heart !! this movie is the best I love and everyone should! Love your animals, no matter what they do, cherish them forever !!!
