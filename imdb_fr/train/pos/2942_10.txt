LOL !!! delirium was so funny .. I was in tears. Eddie Murphys's impressions are absolutely perfect. The best impression was from James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It's odd to see how Eddie Murphy was at the time and how he is now DELICIOUS is a must, but if you do not like foul language, do not look AMAZING AND SO MUCH funny. I've seen it 6/7 times and I'm still peeing Eddie Murphy is at his peak and you can see where he found humor and movie ideas such as Nutty Professor. He also makes impressions of his family, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> If only I was there ...
