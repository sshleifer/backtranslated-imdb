When two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of Breakfast At Tiffany, you know something is going to happen. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes where Patrick was looking at Holly from top to bottom as a kind of lens, it was just weird. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, played a big role. The weird worm was just weird. Nathan was a very beautiful cat. But what is this scene where Patrick followed Holly into a sump and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he fumbling over there? And not all men have a wife, as Sally Kellerman says. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, it was strange.
