Kubrick has again proved its brilliance, now in a horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, father of a child and having a troubled and alcoholic past. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter due to extreme weather conditions, and the person in charge of the facilities has a well-paying job during these five months; and Torrance, who was trying to become a writer, found him perfect. But the leader informed Torrance of the loneliness of this place during the potentially dangerous winter, and told him that a guardian in the past had gone insane and murdered his family. Even before their arrival, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friend who illuminates the future (shines), knew that the place was not good and he did not want to go. Once in the hotel, things started as planned, but after a month, Jack began to behave strangely, irritably and depressed. At this point, we know that something will happen, but we do not know when and how. Frightening things happen, such as the appearance of two twins talking to Danny and one of the other who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later, Jack started seeing other people and immediately felt good with them, as if they were his family. among them, the famous psychotic guardian, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he has to kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. Obeying this order, Jack chooses the goal and many of the scariest things I have ever seen happen here. The end is spectacular and viewers will remain interested and shocked until the last minute.
