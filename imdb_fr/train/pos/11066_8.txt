For a long time, it seemed to me that all the good Canadian actors had moved south of the border and (I guessed) that all the second-tier players were in the top positions and that left the comedies sexual. <br /> <br /> This film was a real surprise: despite the wacky intrigue typical of pranks, the actors seemed to try to put something in their characters and what we, the viewer, have recovered, was a real suspension of belief. When the extras of the music video attacked the expelling police, you almost thought it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the best sexual joke (Canadian or not), you should definitely look for it. outside. And the big surprise, this sexual joke is also loaded with a very good nudity.
