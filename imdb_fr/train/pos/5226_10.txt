What about all the European comments (especially from England) here? All I have to say is that when I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. That's the point. You have to see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to understand the whole joke behind this movie, but see, what were you hoping to see? I can think of a lot of movies that are far worse than that, and they were expensive Hollwood movies with real actors. For what it's worth, Men in White is a very stupid and funny movie model. And with all the stupid-funny stuff that England has been making for half a century, I'm shocked by all the negative comments. We, stupid Americans, love our stupid humor. P.S., see 'Team America: World Police' for laughs that Europeans will particularly appreciate HA!
