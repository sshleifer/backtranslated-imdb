Bromwell High is just great. A clever and well-interpreted scenario, this heart-rending parody of students and teachers at a public school in South London literally leaves you in the midst of laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and lively. The characters are a superbly caricatured sample of British society (or more accurately any society). After the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for lack of a better term, the series does not hesitate to parody all imaginable subjects. Political correctness flies through the window at every episode. If you like shows that are not afraid to make fun of all taboo subjects imaginable, Bromwell High will not disappoint you!
