Go. This film is better than 4 years old. I can see that happening ... rich people have done things more crazy than this one. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy for entertainment, escape the pressure of the world for a few moments and take nothing too seriously. This film is perfect for this purpose. I judge a film on its own merits and I'm not about to compare Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles. I have seen totally dysfunctional people become more and more caring and friendly and could easily live in the street from home. He will stay on my list of "favorite ..... must watch for the holiday season". If you just want to have fun for 90 minutes, look at this one.
