This film is so cheap, it's endearing !!! Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) provides the most entertaining screen rants in the history of cinema. I have 2 copies of this film in video ... on one, Ralph Macchio is surprised cracking in the background at Major Vaugn while he is unleashed on "Hash". Obviously, they forgot to edit this error in the film, but it shows how funny the film is, while the actors themselves can not keep their faces impassible !!!
