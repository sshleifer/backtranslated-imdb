Paul was totally scammed by someone at the top who created Dave. It's the same story, but not so funny. <br /> <br /> Paul told me this morning about the scene where sammy davis sings the parador's new national anthem. he arrived in Brazil after a long flight from Vegas, three planes, a car ride to the plateau, and so on. He was beaten. he could barely bear, had to use a cane. he was staying in a caravan the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> he did not know he could do it. then he saw the crowd of 6,000 extras, paid 7 dollars. he came back to life and they filmed this scene for two hours. he was beautiful, then almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a wonderful man, although very liberal. a real talent.
