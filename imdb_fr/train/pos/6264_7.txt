The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary about 50,000 Bakhtiari and their animals during the summer migration to winter grazing. The basic value of this film today is that of a "time capsule" of a "forgotten people" and the way they lived through what we in the West have known as "crazy years". A more radical contrast could not be imagined. The barefoot fluvial and mountainous crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under water die. To ensure that the public of the time believed that the story had occurred, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered at the end. The version I saw had fascinating Iranian music that could be autonomous and appreciated without the film. That said, the film is probably more valuable to the anthropologist than to the casual viewer looking for a good night out. The crew had barely enough stock to take the photos they had recorded and there is no sophisticated camera work resulting from multiple shots. Inter-title Western titles are damaging to the experience, but are actually part of the record as they demonstrate how Hollywood has tried to give its perspective to the life of an indigenous people so that it is appreciated by the public of the day. Entertainment outside the hours of service by the desert police becomes a "police bullet". The producers then made the docu-drama Chang (1927) and the totally commercial film King Kong (1933). The theme of migration is again used in People of the Wind (1976) and Himalaya (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they commit to - and highly recommended for them.
