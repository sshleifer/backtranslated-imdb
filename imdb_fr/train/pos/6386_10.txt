Disney, the name of the film that once represented all that was innocent and suitable for all ages, finally began to realize that to survive, it had to diversify further. This diversity has been very apparent in the last two years. Movies such as "Tarzan" and "The New Groove of the Emperor" have tried to move away from the traditional routine of Disney's song-driven past to a new unexplored territory. "Atlantis" is the most daring step yet, but we must remember: it's ALWAYS Disney. The first serious film ever released from Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them. In fact, he is so serious that he is part of the PG territory. Perhaps why so many families have been scared to see him this summer. <br /> <br /> But despite the more mature subject, it is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in families, not just mature It was therefore necessary to keep the plot simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to remove it from the realms of "The Little Mermaid" and others. <br /> <br /> potentially detailed plot, unfortunately victim of the coup to be condensed in a film of 96 minutes. In the end, it's an action movie about Atlantis, not the exhibition that precedes it. So we go through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as possible without losing coherence. Suspend your disbelief as to how quickly characters move from one point to another, it is unlikely that you find an animated film as detailed as that of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's "Titanic." Both films present a boat in a certain way. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about love, are we going? Yes, as in many movies, the first film (a Milo Thatch, an awkward archaeologist) and the main one (Kida, the clichéd Atlian princess) will fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I expected. At the end of the film, for once, the sequence of contacts / feelings / kisses of the characters was much more moderate. There are different moments in the movie where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the picture of "The Little Mermaid" (a good thing). <br /> <br /> You may have understood that it is a cliche movie. Correct. You have your main hero and your heroine, supported by more than half a dozen team members participating in the expedition, all being informed of their moments during the film. Many other characters appear, take the few minutes of time, then disappear. It does not take a genius to do the math ?? A 96-minute film focused on action and visuals, with considerable distribution, has very little time to develop the characters in a major way. So, what is it based on? Clichés and a lot of them. Each character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the scientific scientist, the seductive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the eccentric rich, the maniac bag, the Russian femme fatale? should I continue? <br /> <br /> I do not know why this was passed on to someone ?? I found the ironic character of this movie very amusing. Well, it's supposed to be a serious movie, but do you really expect Disney to give up every feature in its history? At least the writers have tried to create a dialogue always spiritual and sometimes even a little inspired. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's these great visuals who put the icing on the cake. The CGI animation is really amazing in places, and does not deny the characters, which was a flaw that left the recent "Titan A.E". down. About characters, Disney hired a comic book artist to create the motifs, bringing an anime style to the movie. Infact, the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to cartoons, far more than any previous Disney release. This led to a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, "Nadia", for the general similarities of the film with the said series of cartoons. Having not seen this anime, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> With the image, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom is the head of the sound team and what a soundtrack! In the foreground, the sound stage is alive and pleasant. James Newton Howard offers a dynamic musical score, which completes the film in all ways, never ringing at the place and always helping to create tension or calm. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the meaning of what the creators intended. For me, the movie suggests it's an adventure trip, but with a more serious tone than any Disney movie before. If you do not like this silly attitude, then perhaps the effort provided in the images will delight you. Heck, at least the mythology is much more correct than one can say of other efforts of Disney (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is a positive review of 10 out of 10, of someone who was blown away by this movie. I still suspend my disbelief with any animated movie ?? after all, the laws of the real world are more than often violated in the medium of caricatures. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and maybe everyone can find something to enjoy about this movie.
