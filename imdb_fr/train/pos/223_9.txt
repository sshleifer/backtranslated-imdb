in one of Neil Simon's best pieces. Walter Matthau and George Burns, exhilarated and grumpy Vaudeville stars, team up for a special TV comedy show. The problem is that they have NOT seen each other for more than ten years. Full of zippy one liners and showbiz jokes, this story flies away with a steady stream of humor. Good work also Richard Benjamin as nephew harried, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse and Howard Hesseman as commercial director of television. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Note: The initial montage contains Hollywood Revue footage from 1929 and shows Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the Brox Sisters singers.
