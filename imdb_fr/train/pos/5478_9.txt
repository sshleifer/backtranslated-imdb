No need to re-read the story since enough critics have done it. Here are some different aspects of one of these "religious nuts", as a fanatical, so tolerant critic says. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) offers perhaps the classic example ever filmed of how women can manipulate men with sex. What Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film reveals a lot of truth: be cute, beat your eyelashes, give your body for free ..... and the men will drop to help you with anything you want. <Br /> <br /> In this case, it was the promotion of employment with the ultimate goal of money ... a lot. It is at least four men in this film who say it, even if it spoils their lives. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which many critics here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods of the world will not give a person the feeling of being fulfilled. A sad comment that so many "critics" here prefer to have immoral messages, preferring speech rather than content. Not surprisingly, I guess. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how you watch the movie, the movie is entertaining from start to finish and Stanwyck has some nice lines, especially at the beginning when she tells of her brutal father and his unruly clients' bar . With a little over 70 minutes, this movie is moving fast and is finished before you know it.
