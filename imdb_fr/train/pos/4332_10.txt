Paul Reiser did a spectacular job writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. He is worthy of an Academy Award. It was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year. Reiser's spirit is fantastic and he lives up to his talent and in the long TV series "Mad About You". Peter Falk did a great job as a father, and Peter, now 78, made us laugh and cry at the same time. The support cast was up to the task, especially the superb Elizabeth Perkins. It's a must-see movie for 2005. We bet everyone, of all ages and all religions, will love this movie and will relate to it one way or another. We have mothers, fathers and brothers and sisters like these in the film. We all had good times and bad times together and we want things to be the same but different.
