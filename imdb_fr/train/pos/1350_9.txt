In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), middle-aged brothers and sisters Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie) live together in Green Gables, a farm located in Avonlea, PEI -Prince-Edward, decide boy from a distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a 14-year-old girl, Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris, a veteran of Disney's "Alice" short film series who will later adopt her character's name). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 years old in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel, but the same actress was not able to credibly move from age 11 to college during the story. The film suffers a bit from this concession, because many of Anne's reactions and what she says are more entertaining, coming from an eleven year old teenager than from a teenager. As in the book, Anne is brilliant and fast, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her silhouette, her freckles and her long red hair. As a child of imagination, Anne takes a lot of joy in life and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the "Queen of Teen Drama" and The writer of the film has chosen to focus on this aspect of her character. Which has transformed the basic genre of family drama slightly fun into comedy. A change that has delighted the public and continues to frustrate purists. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy is very faithful to Montgomery's story, I see no reason to dispute the changes, but let this serve as a warning just to those who expect a totally faithful adaptation . Comedy is the strength of the film because it is one of the first self-reflective parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of the beauties of all time in Hollywood and the film is black and white. The most fun is to see the endless lamentations of the title character on his appearance and the color of his hair contradicted by what appears on the screen. Anne regularly regales her rural companions who are not nonsense with melodramatic lines such as: "If you refuse, it will be a sorrow for me all my life". Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the class board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown is doing a good job, because Anne's love interest, Gilbert Blythe, and Sara Haden steal all the scenes in which she appears as Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
