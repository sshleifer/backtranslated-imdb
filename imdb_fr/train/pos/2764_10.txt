On the eighth day, God created George. But as an eighth day does not come in the week, George does not enter the modern world: he has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, sent back to an asylum after the death of his mother there are four years. She was the only one to love him. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man who is no longer loved. His wife left him for reasons she is unable to explain. He also loses his daughters' love when he arrives too late at the station to pick up the two children who wanted to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a high-ranking businessman. He knows all the rules that allow us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he entered a state of crisis that reached its peak after the loss of his daughters' love. He questions the meaning of his life, without obtaining any precise result. <br /> <br /> Harry and George meet. At first, Harry tries to get rid of George, like everyone else. But George can not be shaken. And gradually, Harry understands how much he needs George if he wants to overcome his identity crisis. It is Georges who opens to him a new access to the world and which makes him see his life with different eyes. Friendship and warmth replace the calculation of the desire to succeed. It is not surprising that Harry can no longer avoid failing in his job. <br /> <br /> George helps her to regain the recognition of her daughters. Even his wife must admit that the fireworks he organized were worth seeing. Nevertheless, a reintegration into the old life is no longer possible. And the news turns out to be a dream with a time limit that will inevitably come to an end. The camera looks at Harry and George from above, for a long minute, as they both lie on the grass, enjoying the moment. But as this minute will inevitably pass, the friendship of the two men, born in such a wonderful way, will not last long. George is destroyed by the impossibility of loving the opposite sex and sees no other way out than to commit suicide. Harry turns to an urban pedestrian who asks motorists who are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity. <br /> <br /> The film portrays modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism devouring positive values ​​such as human heart-friendly relationship. It is Georges, the Mongolian, who seems able to show the way out of this dilemma, but unfortunately, his plea ends badly. However, failure does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or undesirable to achieve the desired goal. The way he shows it to us is surely passable, even if it requires a huge will and especially courage to apply a radical nonconformism.
