Sandra Bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women in the world. She debuted as an actress in the 1970s, but her big break came in 1983 when she starred alongside Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated masterpiece, "The King of Comedy" . His film career never really took off. She made some strange but amusing images, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing parts are the ones she created for herself. <br /> <br /> "Without you I am nothing" is undoubtedly his best effort. It's an adaptation of her hit show, which made her a superstar ?? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes, Sandra goes from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and performs songs made famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich invited Sandra to make a 90 minute tour de force both sexy and particularly funny. If you are a fan of Bernhard, you can not miss this movie. it is a homage to both her beauty (strange) and her extremely unconventional actress talent. And this influenced the filmmakers in their work ?? "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", for example, would be very different if "Without you, I am nothing" did not exist.
