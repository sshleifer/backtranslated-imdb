I do not know how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow managed to do that, but seeing him again will remind you of all the noise that Mrs. Paltrow was making at the base! I had long since left the woman and I still think she's pretty dull in her Oscar-winning performance "Shakespeare In Love," but she's got all the rhythm here - she's almost perfect like Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but you must remember her for that. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by a large support cast including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliet ... Jeremy Northam is very attractive as a love interest, even if the scenario slips a little in his declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all the tension to escape from their relationship); several years later, Ewan's hair is a little easier to style than in 1996 and, personally, I find that the puckish Alan Cumming is a squeaky presence in anything nowadays. But the star is without a doubt Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene where Emma is reconciled with Miss Bates, because she is the personage to whom we are drawn. The film deserves (again) to be watched for its only performance. <br /> <br /> In total, the film has beautifully aged well with a charm and more subtlety than it takes to separate things from the British class system. Well worth a rental (because it is unlikely that Paltrow is such a talented day - but we will always have Emma).
