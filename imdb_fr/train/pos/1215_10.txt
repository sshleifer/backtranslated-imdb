This is my favorite of the three care bear movies. Once again, I liked all the songs. However, as most people have pointed out, the big problem is that this story contradicts the original. For those who saw the first movie remember, the bears met their "cousins" they apparently did not know. It is of course only until the end that the cousins ​​received their belly symbols after proving how much they held dear. However, in this story, cousins ​​grow up with caregivers and carry symbols on their stomachs all the time. That being said, it's not a bad movie if you keep it separate from the first one. I thought that Darkheart's character was far more evil than Nicholas's first. But at the same time, I felt that it added a kind of balance to the gentle care. I also liked the end, although I know other people had mixed feelings about this scene. And of course, I loved the songs. My favorites being Growing up and still young. Care Bear's films have always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
