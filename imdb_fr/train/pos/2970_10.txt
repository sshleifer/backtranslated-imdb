I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! His witty humor made me laugh all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so overwhelmed strengthens the movie comedy. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and it's one of those movies where you'll never get tired of watching it. I have a very short attention span and I think this movie has so much fun that it keeps me entertained all the time. Humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if I remember later. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I think Baseketball is a great movie that everyone should go to see, especially if you're younger, like me because it will make you laugh long after. <br /> <br /> P.s Does anyone think it's strange for me to love them both? eh eh
