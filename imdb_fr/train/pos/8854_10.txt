The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. The love of money leads to greed that can lead to pride and possibly destruction. Two brothers, Andy and Hank, will discover how much the love of money will cost them and those they love the most. <br /> <br /> Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) were no different. Apparently, Andy is enjoying the success of his work on the New York real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina (Marisa Tomei), who is the idea of ​​a trophy woman, if any. Hank, however, is a divorcee who is at the mercy of her ex-wife, her daughter's expensive school bills, and an infinite amount of child support. A man who has good intentions and good intentions, Hank can not escape the water he raises slowly over his head, regardless of the difficulty with which he swims to stay on top. <br /> <br /> However, Andy has his problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better. He has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use to escape his fears. The pressure of his life and the lies he needs to keep his physical appearance have now made him think of fleeing the country with Gina to start from scratch. Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do it and thinks he can get it. How? By stealing the jewelery that their parents own and manage. This act of treason is where the Hanson brothers, their families and many other lives will be destroyed because of greed, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of Before the devil knows you're dead is the way the story is told. After the flight that went wrong and the death of Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), who is both Andy and Hank, the story is told from different points of view, several days before and after the flight attempt. We learn more about the motivations of Andy and Hank, but also about the reaction of their father Charles (Albert Finney) to the death of his wife. The relationship between Charles and his two sons, especially with Andy, is also explored and another possible motivation is discovered after the revelation of the little love between the two men. Nanette may have been loved by her sons, but their father is a different story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once again why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood today by portraying Andy as a greedy criminal with a lack of morality but also, in a contradictory way, as a man with whom we can sympathize. Ethan Hawke also gives life to Hank, not only as a loser, but also as a man desperate to cling to what little he has left. Andy and Hank are thus living in such a realistic reality that it is easy to think that they are not only characters but very real images of lost and confused men who are now facing the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> Before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we could not expect otherwise. More than that, our choices can also affect those around us in an unexpected way. In what should have been the best image of the year, we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate quest to alleviate our struggling lives. In other words, there is no simple solution or solution to our problems and trying to solve them can only make things worse. <br /> <br /> 10/10
