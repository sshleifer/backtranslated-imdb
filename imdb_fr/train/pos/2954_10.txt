This film, although welcomed by critics, has of course not yet been broadcast in the United States on DVD, as another great album, "Housekeeping" by Christine Lahti, released the same year. But if you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVDs, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still a few VHS copies available on the Internet. With a great story, as well as memorable performances by the support troop, especially Claudia Carvan and the late great Jan Adele. Surprisingly, or maybe not, this film and its stars were not recognized at the time of the Oscars, just like "MÃ©nage", but treat yourself to both - you will not regret it!
