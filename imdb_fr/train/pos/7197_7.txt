There have been several films on Zorro, some even made in Europe, for example. Alain Delon. This role was also played by exceptional actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me, the best of all time has always been Reed Hadley. This series offers you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at the end. The show also features a good performance from various B-movie actors such as Ed Cobb, former Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very good performance by Hadley in the role of Zorro. He was fast, smart, using his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any Zorro.
