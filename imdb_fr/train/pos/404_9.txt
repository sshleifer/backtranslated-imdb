It sounds like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in a more surreal and fantastic setting with incredible special effects and computer-generated images that would shame Industrial Light and Magic. The plot may be difficult to follow, but it is the nature of the translation of Chinese folklore on screen; certainly the global story would probably be more familiar to his native audience. However, a smart person should be able to keep up; in addition, the power of martial arts scenes is amplified by CGI.
