I discovered the movie "Holes" when I heard people say that it was not typical of Disney, that children and adults were going down in history. People, let me tell you that I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on Louis Sachar's novel and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent to a strange juvenile detention camp in the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed Zero and together they embark on an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting story, unique, different and fun. I did not know what to expect when I watched him. It was interesting to see the story unfold as pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the young offenders were all very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious like Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
