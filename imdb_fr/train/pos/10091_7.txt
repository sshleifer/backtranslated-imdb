I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by the similarity of its story with the very superior "Rebecca". As others have said, the gentle girl has been swept away by the lord's charming and thoughtful turn of the manor, only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger than life parent but deeply flawed. You have the stern and disapproving maid, a crisis that will bind the couple, or separate it irremediably, culminating in the burning destruction of the sumptuous family property. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" also owes its frightening atmosphere in the jungle to "The Letter", the love triangle Bette Davis located in a rubber plantation in Singapore rather than in a plantation. tea in Sri Lanka. <br /> <br /> Maltin attributes to "Elephant Walk" only two stars, and IMDb readers are not very nice, but I appreciated it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor has never seemed more beautiful and Peter Finch is doing a credible job as a basically good man unable to get rid of the influence of his domineering father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in "Laura" and "The best year of our lives" - is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior decorations in the history of cinema.
