I cherish every image of this beautiful movie. These are ordinary people, whom we all know, who suffer a little in their lives and have luggage to carry. Just like us all. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker bring their portraits to life and are all great, but Harris is particularly heartbreaking and therefore very real. You'd swear he's really a trucker who drinks to feel nothing. Baker also has delicate moments to play with his fiery sister: when DeNiro gives his flowers in a scene, it seems that she has never received flowers before and probably not. Very useful.
