One of the joys of Bela Lugosi's recent collection is to be able to see some delicious films like Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi combine in a film that plunges into meteorites and radiation and, although science is perfectly absurd (especially the photographic technique used by Karloff like Janos Rukh, to determine the site of a certain meteorite ) and outright ridiculous, I did not care about the lease, because the movie is really nice. The effects are well done for the moment, the acting is great and the finishing particularly solid. It reminds me of sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and 1950s, with ray guns and a ridiculous science. You must watch this movie!
