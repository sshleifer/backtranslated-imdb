Let me start by saying that "War, Inc." is not everyone's cup of tea. It is however very nice (and makes you think - "Oh, shit"). The comedy involved in the movie is not obvious at all - it's quite subtle (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning service, etc.), and it changes with the twists and turns of the plot. <br /> <br /> One, but I will not compare that with "Grosse Point Blank", because it's different. John Cusack - I would not say he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. For her part, her sister (Joan Cusack) was amazing in her interpretation of lines and in times, even if she was hardly in the film (I would say the same thing of Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter and manages to get there. Hilary Duff is very commendable for her role as Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very visible in the film and she does a very good job (although her accent is a little unreal). <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is what I would call "entertaining". It does not have a particular scenario, and sometimes it's silly enough, but it contains a subtle message. I would say it's worth a look.
