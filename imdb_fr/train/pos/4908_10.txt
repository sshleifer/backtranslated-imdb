I was born Martin for the first time at the age of 10 at The Movie Channel, and I still remember the impact it had on my skin. It touched me like no other film had touched me, and I remember rolling my eyes. <br /> <br /> After seeing it for the first time, I could not find it anywhere else. I would ask around and no one had ever heard of the movie! I guess it was one of those rarer films that few people knew, because nobody, and I mean nobody, did not know what I was talking about. Over the years, I've searched, glanced, glanced at the shelves of video stores and scanned cable TV programs, but I've always been short. Finally, in 1996, I discovered that I could order it, that's what I did and I've probably watched it at least 50 times since - and it always makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> Martin's party is about. Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but really a good guy), who aspires to go to the lake where he grew up, grew up. It was a special place where he lived in nature, spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life. Soon in the film, he escapes and begins to return to the lake. <br /> <br /> The cops find him quickly and Steckert seizes a child hostage to convince the police to turn around. Soon, Steckert and his hostage (the second Martin) become the best friends of the world and live many fun adventures - from the robbery of a toy truck to the pirouette of a train, all in the direction of this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Steckert has a lot of flashbacks about him at the lake like a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the end, but I will tell you that this film is a must see. It's the BEST movie I've ever seen in my life! I'm definitely the biggest fan of this movie! I managed to find the song that both Martin sang throughout the movie ("I'm going back to the place I'm coming from ...) I'm even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and the cottage where Martin's Day was filmed, I'm crazy, but this movie is so important to me.
