The title of this film is taken from a board game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, NY, and he described it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other kissing games without pre-adolescence. According to the rules, the name of a boy and a girl would be drawn, and the elected officials would order to put themselves in a dark closet and stay there for seven minutes. In the meantime, guests at the party are wondering if both have the courage to hold hands, kiss each other and / or kiss in the privacy of the closet. After seven minutes, the match official said, "The time is up" or we knock on the closet door, and the couple comes out of the closet. After being questioned by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during their "Seven Minutes to Heaven". Then, other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. The couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winner of the game. <br /> <br /> Such games have served as a social icebreaker for children and teenagers, but they can be bothersome and intimidating for children. shy people. . The film received this title because it deals with teenagers' first experiences with love and romance.
