I understand that this film is a first feature film and is therefore very impressive. Director Todd Yellin clearly has the photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of an experienced professional. The plans are well framed and thoughtful and serve to advance the story. The scriptwriter Ivan Solomon and himself deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than the classic "paint by numbers" type scripts. It's a story that needs the talent of Judd Hirsch's characters to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; just like Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to dissociate the young actor from nuances into a role that could easily have been devalued by stereotype or excess. In any case, I found the film refreshing and entertaining.
