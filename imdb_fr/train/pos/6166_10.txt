The bill was essentially a cultural fountain from which emerged a beautiful socio-artistic introspection inspired by famous derivatives such as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3 and, of course, The Wire, more recently. <br /> <br /> With multi-faceted characters and stories that have been described as "Shakespeare in 4 dimensions", The Bill grabs you by the necklaces of episode 1 and just would not let you go . <br /> <br /> The show covered, anticipated and even occasionally caused by all the major world events that occurred between 1984 and 2010. The most famous moment is the episode 19 of the series 5, broadcast on the eve of the second Gulf War. Detective Jim Carver's drug raid - at the end of his career - in Craig Richardson's 'Fun Boy' apartment in the Jasmine Allen estate in early 2003, was widely regarded as an allegory of non-discovery by the coalition of the need to find weapons of mass destruction Iraq a few months later. <br /> <br /> However, this is the job the bill has done to try to highlight some of the lesser-known issues that police have received most praise for. It was a sympathetic drama spanning such sensitive areas as helmet phobia, disguise under uniform, driving homosexuality, stun guns, drunken bestiality (regretted), siren aversion syndrome (SAS), the affliction of the groin caused by the pursuit of suspects a starched uniform and many other problems that disturb, disturb, haunt and excite the officers to this day. <br /> <br /> The last word should go to one of Bill Nelson's most famous fans, Nelson Mandela: "It's no exaggeration to say that I would not have survived the dark void of solitude that summed up my last years of incarceration on Robben Island had it not been Reg Hollis's casual and comforting buffoonery.
