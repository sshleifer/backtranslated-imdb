This is one of the favorite movies of all time. The character of Parker Posey is extremely entertaining and the librarian motif will not be lost to anyone who has ever worked in the world of books and batteries. <br /> <br /> If you are a library student, RENT THIS. Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. The soundtrack is also highly recommended. I showed this movie to more friends in the library than any other - they all fall in love with it.
