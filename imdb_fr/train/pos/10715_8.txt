Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done many ads and commercials here in Canada. Finally, someone has the sense to create a show for her. The case in support seems pretty good too. I have now watched the pilot several times and find it always refreshing. Although I do not know why the series is listed in the category "The Jane Show 2004" (I'm wrong maybe), but to my knowledge, the series was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada at beginning of 2006. a new idea and I hope it's going well. Too bad it can not be paired with Corner Gas. Now, I know that Corner Gas is broadcast on CTV, but both shows would be a good companion.
