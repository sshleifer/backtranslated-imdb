The girl's words are poetic: "I can not continue another year, I have to go to a hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in a sea of ​​leaves." "The marble fauna is moving ... he just gave us a washing machine, that's all." "I'm pulverized by this last thing." "Raccoons and cats are getting a bit boring for too long." "... any rat's nest, mouse hole, I'd rather." And there is wisdom in the words of the mother: "... yes all the pleasure is for me." "This little book is going to keep me right, right like a dye." "Always do everything right." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me my little radio, I have to have professional music." "I'm your mother, remember me?" The relationship mother / daughter is drawn in this magnificent film. It's a Mother's Day movie.
