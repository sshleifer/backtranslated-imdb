Hi guys, <br /> <br /> I searched everywhere for these two movies and I did not find them anywhere in my area. (I am Australian). Could you please help me and tell me where I can buy it. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I have ever seen and are suitable for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie when I was 5 years old and it's still the case now, when I'm a teenager. It's a good movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie, except for my younger sister, because I've watched it many times. I love this movie and can not wait to buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
