THE LAST WAVE is never going to win the main audience. It is a slow but fascinating film for those who are willing to accept it. An Australian real estate attorney is in charge of the case of the five aborigines accused of murdering one of their own. All kinds of omens and omens appear quickly, because the death of man implies a tribal problem that was not intended for the White Court, and very soon the lawyer has trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy. It looks like the end of the world may be close and he and the aborigines know it but no one else knows it. Richard Chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here. David Guptil, a familiar face of several other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of the five aborigines on trial. THE LAST WAVE is just not for everyone, any more than MAGNOLIA (strange things happen from the sky). Check on a slow Saturday night.
