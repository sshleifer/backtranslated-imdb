Another excellent film Arnold. This futuristic movie has a lot of action and is one of Arnie's best movies. Arnold is described as mean in this movie and plays Game of Death. This film is excellent and an excellent sci-fi / action movie. I have always loved this film and it must be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 of 10! PERFECTION
