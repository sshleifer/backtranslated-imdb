A film / documentary about different people in Austria during the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they do and maybe more what they do not do. The tempo is very quiet ...... so you have to relax ... breathe ... exhale before you see it ...... <br /> <br /> but nothing happens and you angry on it..and this is the problem, because it is the atmosphere of the film and the beautiful social and realistic images that are good in this movie ...... ..... many people will say it's disgusting ...... but it's not so bad ... I think it's more used for marketing .... and there are some really fun times ... a 60 old woman stripper ..... I guarantee you this is the most discreet striptease in the history of the movie ...... it's a film that is real..I think it's the word ...... right in the eyes ... .... and that makes it a little scary.no computer manipulation here ..... its real life ... and as we all know, the movies can defeat the reality when it comes to doing sick things ...... .... so it's much worse in the real world ....... > <br /> If you survive the movie, you can start looking at your neighbors and thinking ... maybe they're like people in the movie ... I bet there's a lot there ... sick ... crazy people who live with a beautiful facade ........ after seeing the film I feel more interesting to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> <br /> But maybe you should not see this movie on your first date .........
