Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of those mysterious films in the Sleuth tradition that would be very easy to spoil if one really examines the plot of the film. Therefore, I will be brief in saying that this is a play, a man who is a famous playwright, another man who is a promising writer, his wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been, and a German psychic For the ride. Director Sidney Lumet, who is familiar with film, is quite successful in creating the tension needed for the film. The dialogue is fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine excels in such roles. Christopher Reeve is useful and actually grows the more you see him play. Irene Worth stands out as a funny psychic. How about Dyan Cannon? I love how Lumet wrapped her bum in these tight pants and forced her to wear the most fitted top possible, but she's terribly missed in this role - a role that should have been attributed to an older actress and certainly less attractive. But why quibble with an obvious attempt to corrupt his male viewers while nothing will change him now? Deathtrap is funny, sophisticated, witty and elegant. The mystery has some glaring faults that hurt a bit, and I was not entirely happy with the end, but watching Caine and Reeve under Lumet's guidance with Levin's raised verbosity was enough to capture my interest and keep him captive all the time. throughout the film.
