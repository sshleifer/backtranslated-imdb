This smooth and grainy film always offers. This is one of the best and most underrated Frankenheimer movies and is without a doubt Elmore Leonard's best adaptation to date (and if you scratch your head thinking "but I loved GET SHORTY ", you must be punched). In my opinion, no one better understands the "feel" of Leonard's characters than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the history of Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) raises the sleaze factor of history to astonishing heights. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer movies include SECONDS and THE CANDIDATE MANCHURIEN. I also have a real special place in my cold film heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
