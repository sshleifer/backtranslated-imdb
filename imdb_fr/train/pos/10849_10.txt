This is perhaps the best rockumentary of all time - a British, better This Is Spinal Tap. The characters are believable, the plot is awesome and you can actually understand certain events, such as Ray's problem with group integration. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Real times, even if it's in the same tone, you'll be humming certain songs for days. What I liked was the almost entirely British distribution, with some of the favorite household names. Ray's wife is priceless ... <br /> <br /> The movie never lags, it just goes at the right pace and has some really fun sections. A generator of very good slogans! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
