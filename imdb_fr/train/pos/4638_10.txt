I saw this film when I was in Israel for the summer. my Hebrew does not speak fluently, so the subtitles are very useful, I did not feel lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to the subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me away !!!!!! He portrays two of the Middle East's most prominent taboos today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows one person to enter simultaneously into both areas of conflict. The dilemma, the emotions involved. The film culminates in tragedy when anger and rage push one of the lovers towards an extremist side! an absolute to see !!
