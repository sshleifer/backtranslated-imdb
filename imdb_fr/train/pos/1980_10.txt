One of the last great musical comedies of the 60's. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it's always been a favorite. The musical numbers are all memorable. By the 1960s, musical comedians had a real musical talent (unlike a current musical comedy named by the CERTAIN Academy Award and based in a major Midwestern town). All the main roles have been beautifully interpreted ... Ron Moody shines in the role of Fagin, as Shani Wallis in the role of Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threatening Bill Sikes (who luckily does not have a music number, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were also excellent. Mark Lester appears as an innocent waif, which was the intention of Dickens when he wrote the book! Then, of course, there are the dozens of dancers who play in "Consider yourself", "I'll do anything", "Who will buy" and "Be back soon", many of whom were children! It's a great show for the whole family.
