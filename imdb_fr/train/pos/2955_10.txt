I have always found a certain attraction in the discovery of the great (semi-) unknown film. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror are unknown for very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on video in a junk store, mixed with innumerable dozens of cassettes of different qualities. Of course, this is the only place I could find it because it's not on DVD yet. <br /> <br /> As I watched Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout the movie, I was sure I was watching a great undiscovered performance. Yes, I had already seen Davis in several small rooms - and a leading role in "A Passage to India". But, even though she was superb in the aforementioned film, "High Tide" is a totally different animal. Since I recently watched Gillian Armstrong's latest film, "Charlotte Gray", I am perfectly aware of the type of actress who impresses her. Davis draws much more than an ephemeral resemblance to Cate Blanchett - both in sensitivity and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The performance of Judy Davis is stunning, I can not say enough for her. She shares an incredible on-screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (Ally), the other great actress of this film. They share a drama and a silent humanity whose details I do not pretend to reveal here (see for yourself!). There are too many good things in "High Tide" to cover in a review. In fact, I do not care - the film speaks pretty well for itself. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the writer Laura Jones for her amazing dialogue, the director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actors and the great Russell Boyd for her brilliant sober cinematography (see her work in "Tender Mercies").
