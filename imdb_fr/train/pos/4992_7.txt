In general, I find that Loretta Young is difficult to take, too concerned about her appearance and too feminine as a bad way. But in Frank Borzage's lyrical romance, and even though she plays a mate of self-esteem that is too much of a bully from Spencer Tracy, she's straightforward, honest and irresistible. It's a funny little movie, played mostly in a one-room hut of a Hooverville, unusually speaking of the Depression, but romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing an "ordinary guy" scathing and hard to take who would be a terrible chauvinist and a tyrant by today's standards, softens the hard side of his character and makes him almost attractive. The support work of Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who have never been as far as she should have been) is excellent, and Jo Swerling's screenplay is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who has always loved to dramatize true lyrical close-up love, and Young. You want to somehow slap her and tell her character to get used, she's too good for this guy, but she's so rosy and persuasive that you look with satisfaction at their story unfold satisfactorily.
