Read My Lips, an extraordinary and unusual film by Audiard, is a pulpy and solitary thriller. It is perfectly suited to Vincent Cassel's beautifully graying charisma and offers a wonderfully mastered interpretation of Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a recurring feature of Audiard just like KArin Viard for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: an unconventional beauty (she is described by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile. <br /> <This is almost the definition of her role as Carla, a vaunted office beast, brought on by colleagues who exploit her deafness. Yet she finds a mining friend, if you will, in ex-prisoner Paul de Cassel. Each exploits the unconventional talents of the other (flight and reading on the lips) to fight against their respective situations and form a unconventional romantic rapprochement. Devos / Audiard manages the deafness of Carla and her entourage, her inner world curled with a discrete and elegant touch. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001), Audiard already clearly controls its management of the tension, the action and the investment of its frame. with a truly visceral experience that will become the great success - a prophet - nine years later. 7/10
