Finally! An Iranian film that was not shot by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbaf. It's a non-documentary, entertaining dark comedy with subversive girls who subtly kick the "system". It's all about football and it's funny, it's really funny.

He won the grand jury prize, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, he is almost perfect. Where can I get it?
