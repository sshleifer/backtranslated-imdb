Think Pierce Brosnan and you think sweet, dapper, smart James Bond. In this film, Brosnan plays against the guy - and has a lot of fun (just like the audience). It's a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harassed businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie, with very good good scenes, conforming "off" - the Kinnear edge have some good lines). My only disadvantage is that hope Davis, who plays the woman, so tolerant ("Can I see your weapon?"), Does not appear more often: it could have been a wonderful leaf for these men. <br /> <br /> This film is like a matador: it plays with the public while "being killed". The end is impressive because a scenario (with a positive morality!) Emerges: it is a frenetic film, frenetic and amusing, which deserves a large public.
