Othello, Shakespearen's classic story about love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school. In fact, I've probably found Othello my favorite Shakespeare story because of his fascination, because Shakespeare perfectly captured the feeling of friendship, love and racism. I mean, when you really study this story, you could go into so many philosophies explaining why Othello went mad with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later for my report, I also watched this version of Othello and I must say that it was absolutely great. Lawerance and Kenneth capture history so well and understand darkness. <br /> <br /> Othello is the great soldier of his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello has snuck in with his daughter Desdemona, the king is furious but exempts him. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, Cassio, his companion instead of Iago, who stood by his side. Because of his crazy jealousy, he wants revenge. Posing as Othello's best friend, he alludes to Othello that Desdemona deceives him with Cassio, never saying it, but suggests to Othello that this is happening. Othello has gone crazy and has no pleasing plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an amazing story, I highly recommend reading it. It's an amazing story that makes you think after reading it. Othello, the film is also excellent and once again, I recommend it, it has perfectly captured the story and has a very heartbreaking feeling. Otherwise, you could simply be shocked by what's going on between Othello and Desdemona. love would betray him. It's a fantastic movie, great acting, good backdrops and a good staging, that's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
