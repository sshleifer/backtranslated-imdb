Those unfamiliar with Cassandra Peterson's alter-ego Elvira are a good starting point. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, mistress of darkness" begins with our heroine whose gravity defying breasts receive a message. It seems that one of her great aunts has passed away and needs to be present for the reading of the will. Anxious to raise funds for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to leave in hopes of getting a lot, a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, she has to go to the city of Fallwell. , Massachusetts. Having to stay a spell because of the breakdown of her car, she discovers that her great aunt has left 3 things: a house, a dog and a cookbook. The city's inhabitants have mixed reactions: teenagers like her, women hate her, and men covet her (even if they try to remain the moral pillars of the community). His biggest problem turns out to be his great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) because he wants his cookbook. Looks like the cookbook is a spell book that will make it a more powerful warlock. <br /> <br /> The film is actually quite funny, with Peterson alias Elvira using his "endowments" and his sexy side as a joke ("remember, tomorrow we show the head with two things .. I mean the thing with two heads "). Especially funny like Edie McClurg in Chastity Pariah, the woman who strives the most to keep the city in line, but looks ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). Worth a look (the movie, not her breasts, of course).
