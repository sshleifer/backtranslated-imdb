What movie! I never imagined that Richard Attenborough could have such a film in him. Gandhi has always left me indifferent, aside from Ben Kingsley's performance, and I have never considered Attenborough a particularly talented filmmaker. But Cry Freedom has kept my interest, like few movies lately. It's a fascinating and hypnotizing political film with great performances by Kevin Kline and young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays the role of Donald Woods, editor of a South African newspaper that befriends civil rights activist Steve Biko. It begins as a difficult friendship, because Woods regards Biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites. But Biko, with his kind words, optimistic attitude and total transparency, wins over Woods and presents him with a reality about apartheid that Woods did not know at all. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent, law-abiding citizen who selflessly stands up against all prejudices and the system that keeps his people. One night, coming from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten to death. The authorities are trying to silence the issue, because Biko has become a great personality in South Africa. But thanks to Woods' efforts, the truth is revealed. But what should be a triumph becomes a nightmare only when Woods and his family become the target of the secret police. <br /> <br /> This film presents an interesting structure. In fact, it has two narratives: it first describes the life and death of Biko. It's an incredible first half, completely dominated by Washington's charisma in what could be its greatest performance to date. <br /> <br /> The second half, no less interesting, tells of Woods's attempt to escape from South Africa to publish a book about Biko. Woods has become an enemy of the state, a forbidden person, which means he can not meet people or leave his country. Moreover, he is constantly being spied on by the police. Kevin Kline also made an excellent performance in the second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first period is relatively simple, the second realizes interesting things with editing, giving flashbacks of Biko and events showing the repression against the film. Black South Africans. Some may say it's more interesting, but for me, the second half is equally captivating, as Woods and his family are developing a bold plan to flee South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes have been so heartbreaking. was in tears. The score of George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa is for something. Although I've never been a big fan of Fenton (I can not stand his Gandhi score), I still think that the score of Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful compositions ever written for cinema. The film, thanks to music associated with powerful images, has sometimes reached incredible peaks of emotion. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is certainly not a fair movie to watch because of Denzel Washington. It is a film to cherish in its entirety. Actor, writing, music, editing, cinematography form a perfect synthesis to create a hymn to the power of the human spirit. This film deserves a place alongside films like The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
