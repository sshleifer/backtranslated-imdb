In the hands of a more experienced director, this film would have been considered a masterpiece of horror. Despite director Michael's "Death Wish", the film is interesting, original and more than a little scary. <br /> <br /> The screenplay puts more than one clich√© of horror in the shelter (many can not shake) including Chris Sarandon as a boyfriend of the heroine who listens while she insists that strange things happen. Burgess Meredith is lovely as a kindly crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner haunts with a young Beverly D'Angelo her dumb and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a lot of work sitting on a chair. And pay attention to the brief appearance of an unknown Chris Walken at the moment! This film is scary and creative. The twists of the plot are charming, although somewhat predictable. The climax, which I will not give any details, is disturbing and quite impressive. Again, a better director could have done more, but it is nevertheless very satisfying - at least for those who have the sensitivity of the horror of the 70s. <br /> <br /> If you like modern phantasmagoria with body counting and overproduction, you won not like that. There is almost no gore. The management is quite spartan. The effects are few, although there is a nice makeup towards the end - most of them not actually ... but maybe I have already said too much. <br /> <br /> I noticed it a little. higher than its quality can justify, but I enjoyed it as much as any movie "8" that I saw.
