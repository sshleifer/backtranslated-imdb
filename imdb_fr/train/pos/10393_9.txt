Let's cut short. I loved every minute. A sumptuous fantasy in the purest Arabian-Nights style. There is an evil magician, a pretty princess, a jinn and everyone lives happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from this classic. Only downside: the special effects are quite dated (sabu adored with the foot of the jinn!)
