At first glance, who sings out there seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy ?? with only a kind of unusual movement, silent and slow: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers in a desert landscape, then a bus and a wonderful band of actors, it hides a jewel! <br /> <br /> The folded story and a false rhythm induce you to think, yes it's funny, but lets you guess that it will be a kind of soft film. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny by the moment, dark cynical about others, its development surprises you throughout the story ?? Very ingeniously and cleverly presented, all the characters are important and the actors give them all their life. <br /> <br /> And what is amazing is based on an in-depth observation, a great mastery of the work of the camera and has great meanings. and really everything, the general direction and the way the details are presented, which simply forget that it is a film: it's like watching a benevolent human society, we do not know yet, filmed by a friend behind a camera . <br /> <br /> And you are the one who follows him. It's simple, and simply exceptional! <br /> <br /> Do not understand me; this does not mean that the script, the quality of the image, the score have a kind of amateurism, no, no! This is great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river ?? From the top of the mountain to the sea, with all kinds of terrain and wanderings that a real river will have to face on its journey to the sea ?? From a small thing to a main stream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image that I used is the best way I can find to explain all the charm that Sings There is. For me, once again, I take the hammer: simply exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the director is the one who created Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know very discreet? ? But as I have not seen it yet, I had no idea of ​​this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other critics have written rave reviews about this movie, I totally agree with you! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema is not well known because it's rarely translated, but I'm lucky to have a copy in the original language, with good English subtitles. All in all: deep, delicious and exceptional ... <br /> <br /> For quick and empty explosive types and special effects, avoid it at all costs, it may be too subtle and good for you! <BR /> <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, I guess you will not regret it, and in case of purchase, your personal DVD library will be well accompanied, with big names such as Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of the poet Orson Welles ***
