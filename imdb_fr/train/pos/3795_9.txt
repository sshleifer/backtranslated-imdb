After watching this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to find out how to get a copy. Jim McKay then gave a lecture (Q & A) on the film that presented his ironic situation: how to be distributed for a film that depicts minorities (women, non-white) working to resolve controversial issues (pregnancy at the teens, teens single mothers) and how to write a true story on all these topics being a 35 year old white man. The multi-racial and multi-genre audience of mostly adults adored the film's fantasy scenario, its detailed characters and its fantastic portrayal of "real teenage life". Most teenagers, however, had left the building - which makes me think that it is a movie that adults with children look better at, making it a starting point for discussion rather than, like many adults think, "a movie should be seen it's about them." Therefore, the issues of distribution - how can we get hold of it? Internet (retail) would be a great way - it's a film that will be buried, like "Pups" or other dramatically modern teen movies - and McKay seemed responsive. As a screenwriter / director, McKay was extremely sensitive and detailed in his work - aligning with the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film unfolds, working with the actors to portray the characters in their own vision of what they should be doing. think. to be - with the results being extremely realistic.
