I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I was not interested in opera at the time, but he changed his mind. I really liked this movie and since then I really enjoyed the opera. I even bought several of his CDs. Who cares about his acting abilities, he just played himself, which was adorable. He was so charming, so charismatic. Honestly, I just wanted to take him in my arms. I am very sad that so many people are criticizing him so hard. It was so simple that I did not accept people pushing or judging him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will certainly be missed !!!
