A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in an Oscar-winning performance) pursued by his own conscience. McLaglen plays a red IRA who betrays his leader to get a reward during the Irish Sinn Fein rebellion. The scenes showing the fighting and the actions of the crowd are very realistic and focus on the desperation of the individuals. Lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford superbly creates a dark and tense atmosphere, reinforced by the foggy and filthy description of the Irish landscape. The dramatic music of Max Steiner adds to the cinematic pleasure. Oscar Winner also for the best screenplay, nominated for the best film. It's one of Hollywood's classics.
