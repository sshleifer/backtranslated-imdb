After reading just two of the comments below, as a lifelong fan, starting with Olivier's Heathcliff and persisting with the many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester", it's more than telling to see that this is the sister of UNsung Bronte who gave the ment to the chauvinist period that the trio inhabited. Of course, the "miracle" in the three versions of nineteenth-century British rule is that "girls" were all "single" and that their only realistic brush with "men" was their vicar father and their wastrel? brother. That said, it is finally ANNE Bronte who, in her unique test ?, proved that the point "feminist" was well ahead of the contemporary types, including in the ranks of "franchisees voters". However, history counts more than a few of his predecessors, including the Greek heterai and Sappho and the likes of an ancient emperor, Yang Kuei-fei. And what about "Eve" and her apple?
