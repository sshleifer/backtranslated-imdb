I stumbled upon this movie listing all the movies I wanted my sister to record for me while I was on vacation and I'm very happy to have included this one. It deals with problems that most filmmakers fear, my only problem with this film is that it was designed for television and I could not buy a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> It's a touching story people with eating disorders do not necessarily fear everyone and how many actually have buddies on a diet. This has drawn my attention to the fact that although bulimics can maintain a relatively stable weight, their health consequences are more serious than many people are unaware of.
