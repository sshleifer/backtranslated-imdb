The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role of all time), the last spy spied on the group, completes his quest for identity by also seeking to end the program "Blackbriar" of the CIA to make great assassins like him. <br /> <br /> I was so excited about this one that I watched his predecessors yesterday and today. The identity was as bright as I can remember and supremacy remains the weakest (but still nice) link in the chain for the weakest plot and, aside from a car chase that the continuation of this film easily overcomes, a slight lack of action and suspense. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, Ultimatum has some suspense! Even if you know that Bourne will escape the authorities (and that these films portray the police as inept), it is always brilliant to see him do it. It is staggering to think that two armed types of handguns and mopeds can create 10 times more suspense than anything these giant 150 million-dollar robots did in Transformers. Stedicam is shooting in a documentary, even if he is filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like the CIA headquarters where no one within 10 km would be allowed to use a camcorder. He seemed to listen to my different complaints with Supremacy, because the action in Ultimatum is nothing short of impressive, with various tools used as weapons, like a candlestick, a hard cover book (I will never look at them again). same way) and an electric fan (do not ask). The music also helped to create a lot of suspense and there was almost never a moment to not break the mouth. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character "Nicky" puts her situation in danger a new light very nice. Damon plays his signature role with reserve but skill (which may seem minor but suggests that Matt Damon could escape the CIA and Interpol is something), but poignant moments while he still struggles to find his humanity. This desire of his real life could become boring, and almost in Supremacy, but works better in Ultimatum (better scenario). <br /> <br /> I think of a scene from "Goldeneye" (the only good movie of Pierce Brosnan Bond) in which the character of Sean Bean asks James if the martinis silence the cries of all men that he killed. Bourne regrets all the people he killed and considers (or at least made me think) the meaning of a goalless action, a life without meaning and how the government turned men into resources . Although resources know Krav Maga and can make weapons from anything. <br /> <br /> Sidenote: It always bothers me that, despite being a super-sword and tracked by the CIA, Interpol and police almost everywhere he goes, Bourne never thought of make the slightest attempt to hide his features or to forge new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have the pulse and you like action movies, Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action movie to come out this year. Of course, you would be crazy to see this without looking at others first. It's a bit late, but I'm almost tempted to ignore it. This is the first film "3" this summer to at least equal, if not exceed, the original and say something. <br /> <br /> A-
