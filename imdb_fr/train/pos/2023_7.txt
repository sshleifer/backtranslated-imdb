Spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the original on television some time ago and I remembered this production less appealing than most Beeb costume dramas. I revisited on DVD this week and I still have the same impression. It's a good story at first, but it gets weaker when the heroine becomes so terribly brave and noble and returns to her husband totally vile when he's sick and I'm so irritated by his holiness. I guess it was the "right thing to do" when the story was written and it created a lot of anxiety and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband because the marriage did not did not make more than his possession, let alone continue scandalously with a lover, as I expected, the modern public would have liked to see. But it is difficult to take santonia today and especially when this heroine had a strong and courageous admirer ready to defend her against everyone. So the story is like in the movie, I'm equivocal. It is well done as in the novel, but a little irritating in the way of life today. <br /> <br /> The unshakable hero Gilbert was certainly a saint to endure the variable and often cryptic behavior of his ladylove and his persistent self-denial. to be so always favorable. So it was a shame that when Helen was finally free to be with him, the screenplay did not allow her more than a minute or so to kiss quickly before the titles appeared. It was completely ridiculous when we had waited all this time for all this disgusting feeling towards the unworthy husband of a decent dialogue and a good embrace between hero and hero. Instead, the end was as if the filmmakers had run out of time or money or simply could not be bothered. "You are - a minute, do what you can in this, then cut as the director wants to go home now ....." I found myself totally dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, very high congratulations to Toby Stephens, a perfect and very beautiful hero, and to Rupert Graves, a villain superbly wicked and self-indulgent. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory within the limits of the scenario that forced her to be a depressing and rather moralizing victim so often. <br /> <br /> That said, I love these classic dramas and almost all are a better view than a lot of "modern" drama on TV these days. So 7 stars because despite the irritation is always a good watch.
