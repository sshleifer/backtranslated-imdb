Ride With The Devil directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger) is another jewel of this beautiful director's cap. For those who do not know the history of the wars on the border between Kansas and Missouri during the American Civil War. See this film and you will visit a piece of sad Americana. In addition to beautiful action scenes (sometimes very bloody). It is a story of love and devotion between men and a lady in particular. It's played by Toby Maguire, Ulrich Jeffrey Wright and Skeet, and as a young Jewel, I have never seen her or seen her before, I want to see her more often. novel) <br /> <br /> This is a 128-minute long film, but worth watching. <br /> <br /> my rating is **** <br /> <br /> respectively submitted <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
