Yes, some intrigues are a bit difficult to follow, and The Bill tends to become violent, but it's actually a captivating series, which I try not to miss. A large majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is pretty good, although I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I must admit that I prefer older episodes to more recent episodes, and it is a shame that the show continues, while I found it easier to watch at 8 o'clock. Yet, why I love The Bill is because not only is it captivating, but the cliffhangers in the end make the next episode unavoidable. It's true, though, that it's more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
