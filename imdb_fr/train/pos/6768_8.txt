One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, the descent began when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to watch her, as well as Ernest Borgnine's character making war on herself. The last episode in which she appeared was one of my favorites for the second season. Unfortunately, at that time, blacks did not spend long on television. Some episodes of the second season were acceptable, but the third season was more focused on human characters than on Airwolf and was only released near the end of the series. When it was in the USA, it was disgusting !!!
