Expecting to see another Nunsploitation movie with a nasty senior mother abusing and torturing her accusations, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I expected. <br /> <br /> It actually has a feminist scenario, although I do not think such a term existed at the time of filming. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and Jews and the poor) are very oppressed and locked up in tiny places in society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she can no longer sit and do something, but with disastrous results. <br /> <br /> The pre-credit sequence has Flavia in his teens near a battlefield. She sees a wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to assist him. Before she can do it, her father, hateful, beheads the soldier and faces his head (great family dynamics, huh?). After that, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. Although the scenes involve violence, rape and nuns, I would consider it more a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> Indeed, most of the ingredients of a trashy operating room are present, but the acting, the camera work, the screenplay and the music are too good for stay at this level. Most of the "nones" films that I have seen generally have the following basic principle: A good girl ends up in a convent, where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch who likes to whip people and / or make their life a hell. Flavia spends most of the first part of her film passively questioning all the atrocities that are happening around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes familiar with the strong spirit (but slightly wacky - she loves to pee out like me, but it's much easier for guys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attacks their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not tremble with fear like the other nuns. Their assailants act in reality as their liberators (of the cruelty and quasi-slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian and not a Muslim invader who impales the dear sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It is the death of Agatha who sends Flavia in her violent crusade against those who oppressed her ... Her father treats her like a dirt. His Muslim lover deserts her at a very untimely time. I do not want to tell the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. It's a great movie, so do not be put off by its (undeserved) epic reputation of trash. In addition, how could a film starring Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli be wrong? I do not know the other works of María Casares well, but Sister Agatha is an infernal character. <br /> <br /> I have read many positive reviews about the release of Synapse (US), but I love my X German. Kult DVD classified. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually contains a little more information on all sides than the Synapse release. <br /> <br /> There are also many lines of dialogue, both wise and funny (many Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> "Why is God a man?" Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, they are all men! " -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid - look at them, my sister- Fear that their power is taken away from them!" -Sr. Agatha (concerning Christians fleeing after the arrival of Muslims) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going Muslims can not do anything to you that Christians have not done!" Ha Ha Ha! -Sr. Agatha (to a group of Christian women fleeing) <br /> <br /> "May the Lord bless these Muslims for scaring these pompous Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Do you need the simple sight of a Muslim to make you pay for your underwear?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message: "Flavia Gaetani, not yet Muslim - more Christian - was punished as a nun fleeing.The idea of ​​this film was born from the events that occurred during the invasion of Italy by Musalman, in what we still remember today as THE MARTYRDOME OF 800 AT OTRANTO "
