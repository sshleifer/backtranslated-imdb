I just saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2001. The working title was "Dog Days". Public reaction was mixed. Some people found that graphic sex and realistic violence were too much for them. Others seemed to really appreciate the quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is not for sensitive souls. It's like 'happiness' with an explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is animal poisoning, a striptease of an elderly person, an orgy bath in a mall, the anal penetration of a candle and the agitation of the mentally deficient. <br /> <br /> If this sounds like too much to handle then this movie is not for you. This film shows the most desperate and pathetic humanity. The banality of our existence is addressed to us with immense joy. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here. And why should he? This film presents excellent performances by all involved, is always interesting and is probably the most intelligent social statement to make on a film from time to time.
