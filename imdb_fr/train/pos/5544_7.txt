The People's Republic of China, which was the lowest of the bass, has actually reached the gold with this little thriller moody. They had done the same thing a year earlier with "Detour", which is probably one of the best low budget movies ever made. <br /> <br /> "Strangling" is essentially a film with a single film, filled with fog and shadows, a technique used by most studios of the poverty line to hide the sets, or their absence. But here, it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) hovers around the marsh killing the people involved in his execution for murder and arouses sympathy on the part of the viewer. His last victim is to be the smuggler's daughter ..... he focuses his anger not only on those who are directly involved in his destiny, but also on their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche imitates as usual someone in a coma who is considered as an actor. She offers herself to the strangler to put an end to the murder, but the strangler sees the goodness of his gesture as a sign that his mission is complete and he returns to the hereafter, somewhat chastised. If Ulmer (who directed "Detour") made "Strangler", she would be hanging on the nearest tree and the choke job would be finished. But who is complaining? It is not the story that constitutes the main attraction, but the sets, the lighting and the general atmosphere of the room. It stands right behind "Detour", the best time in the People's Republic of China.
