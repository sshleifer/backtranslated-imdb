Like many here, I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many who did, I love this show! I think it was very well done and thoughtful. All about it brand as a spin-off that should not be taken seriously. The formula is simple: it's a parody of other cartoons with one bad guy trying to get the best of the good guys. Using well-known characters from Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, it's much easier to engage the viewer with parodic humor right from the beginning of each 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There has always been Scooby-Doo fallout. who annoyed the fans. The classic is the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts of the 80s. These spin-offs had their place: they allowed the sale of new content, created new fans and kept the Scooby-Doo products on the shelves. I would agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a clue!" It does not fit that traditional role, but it's probably what I've always wanted the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action-packed show that focuses on the funniest characters and more fun of Scooby-Doo! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to details, the bad guys, the relationship of "best friend" between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant humor! Bad features: None, although the refitted Mystery Machine is close enough sometimes. <br /> <br /> Bravo Warner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest cartoons in a long time!
