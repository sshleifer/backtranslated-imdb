Dana Andrews represents "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in this 1950 film also starring Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays Detective Sergeant of New York City. Mark Dixon, a bad-tempered cop who has had trouble in the past for beating suspects. When a man is murdered in a gangster-owned gaming club, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner will investigate. Scalise attributes the murder to Ken Paine (Stevens), who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but also with the victim. Dixon thinks that the victim has made a lot of money and has been killed as a result by gangster men. He goes to see Paine and, not realizing that he has a plaque in his head dating from the war, throws him to the ground and kills him inadvertently. Now he has to cover the murder. As an additional complication, he falls in love with Morgan; his father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine's apartment after finding that he had hit his daughter, is arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> This is a really great black and grainy, with good performance. Andrews, a strong and handsome man, is convinced that he is a tough and nervous detective who must stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The film unites him with his fabulous "Laura" costar, Gene Tierney, and she looks ravishing to become a tasteless dummy in men apparently used to being brutalized. She knows little, she has another on her hands. Ken Tully does a remarkable job as a father, protesting his innocence despite overwhelming evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as the boss of Dixon. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this film well done, fast and absorbing is the end. Pure Hollywood and, putting myself in the place of Tierney, I doubt to act in the same way. A minor criticism for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find it as impressive as "Laura", but few things in this world are. If you like black film, it's a must.
