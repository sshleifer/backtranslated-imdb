The Gang of Roses. "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> A mixture of old western and hip-hop, perfectly mixed. The dress styles, the landscapes and the plot are all adapted to what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Intrigue - in five years, they stole twenty-seven banks and then disappeared without trace. Now a small town in the west is besieged and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Rose Gang is ready to go up again. And this time, it's a personal matter. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five women who split after five years of riding together. When Rachel's sister is killed, she eventually finds her friends and rolls on a revenge track. <br /> <br /> A good muddy version of the western. (If you've seen Bad Girls, it's a bit better like female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave it 10/10 because the characters, the plot and the landscapes did it for me.
