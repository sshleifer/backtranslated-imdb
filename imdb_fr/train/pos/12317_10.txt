A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story, it is possible that the effects special appear dated in relation to modern technology. The film is based on a simple premise: a mediocre debt collector must stay in an isolated area while trying to recover a debt. Of course, it turns out that this too is haunted. <br /> <br /> What I did not expect the first time I saw this movie is that this is one of the most touching love stories that I have never seen. it is without losing anything of the comedy burlesque which will make you lose the head. Unlike some Asian movies, A Chinese Ghost Story is not hard to swallow for those who are not familiar with Chinese culture. Indeed, he plays on timeless themes and without culture of paranormal and romance. <br /> <br /> Think Evil Dead 2, if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix. This film is real, although it is neglected by many. It's absolutely the best I have ever seen. Its ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and transcend cultural boundaries to please humanity around the world is nothing short of fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.
