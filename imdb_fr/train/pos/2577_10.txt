My dad grew up watching George Reeves as Superman, and when I was little he had episodes on VHS and let me watch them, including this movie (pass them on to the family if you want), and I I loved them. <BR /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with an oil mine and emerging mine of radioactive mole men targeted by the city supposed to be deadly and it is up to Superman to end to this chaos. <br /> <br /> It's so wonderful and fun to see. Special effects and old-style sound - the crew has achieved such beauty with so little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was little, and I'm 16 now, it shows how timeless and classic these adventures are.
