Believe it or not, Inspector Gadget's latest case is what made me addicted to the whole gimmick thing. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I'm 12 years old. So I was apparently not there when Inspector Gadget was at the top of his career. Of course, I had heard of him, but I did not really know him. <br /> <br /> When reading, note that I have never seen the original series (I would do it if it came!). That's pretty much the only thing I've ever seen on a gadget (although I'm obsessed now) and I'm going to focus on what I liked because everyone is so negative. For all the pessimists, I also have disadvantages there. = P First of all, for a childish sense of humor, you might find this movie quite funny. I thought it was, so sue me. I also thought that the animation and the character design were good, and I'm also happy that it contains more gadgets because it's my favorite character. (I do not like Penny.) Then there was Claw (his voice was awful, though) and the Madcat; I thought they were pretty well done too. Gadget's idiocy seemed pretty much in place, if not a little exaggerated (ie sucking the thumb of his hand in the hat.) That would make a good screenshot, though. I liked the song that appeared in the credits. Yes, I am strange. <br /> <br /> And, as in all films, there are also disadvantages. <br /> <br /> Talking cars? What's up with that? You can say that it was aimed at younger boys. It would not bother me so much if cars did not save the day. I would have much preferred if Penny and Brain had taken their place. And, apparently, Gadget loved his car more than one could call natural. A little weird, it's the least we can say. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the chief was downright nasty with Gadget. Sheesh, yes, he was not always the happiest of people, but he did not hate Gadget, from what I read. Like the inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, that's about all I have to say about this movie. I thought the animation made up for the car-centric plot and was pretty decent overall. more than Gadget's live-action movies (butcher, butcher, butcher!) at least. Maybe I'm just biased because that's what brought me into Gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is crooked, or maybe I'm just weird, but I really liked this movie, even though I'm the older, it's recommended for.
