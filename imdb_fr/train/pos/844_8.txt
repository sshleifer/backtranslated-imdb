A chance meeting between a salesman and a hitman transforms their lives. It's a strange film that works, an impressive effort for screenwriter-director Shepard. In a daring and unglamorous role that is far from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as a lonely hit-man who begins to give way under the stress of his job, but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone else for the first time. help to cope. Kinnear is as good as the salesman, an honest boy with a void in his life. Davis is doing well as a pretty Kinnear woman. Primarily a character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
