I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s and now, in 2006, this movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. You will not be sorry. It's well played, so real and never a boring moment. The acting is superb and the location gives the impression that you are there. From beginning to end, this film is the type that makes you lose your attention. The actress is doing a great job in describing the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to survive alone in the Amazon. It is incredible that anyone can survive in such conditions. That's why this movie is so attractive. The fact that it is a true story makes the film even more interesting and it is quite incredible to think that a girl can survive this test. I find this film a movie that I can watch over and over again and one that I do not get tired of. It's really a compliment, because I have hundreds of movies! I would say it's probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
