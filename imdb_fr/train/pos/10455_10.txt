This film must be one of the most sincere and touching films ever seen between boys and girls. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" offer beautiful portraits, this film cuts out the secondary intrigue and the unnecessary Hollywood differences. This film focuses only on the birth of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a second that the film will lead to the romantic pairing of these two people. You immediately feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just pure happiness to see them find it. This film is mainly based on dialogue. But every conversation between them too is extremely intriguing. What makes this couple so romantic is how real it is. How, throughout this conversation, while often, having no real impact on a critical issue, you can feel the nuances as these two people become more affectionate and confident about each other. This is exactly how you would dream to meet someone special. And what makes it so true is that it's not even too fantastic to believe it. It could be what would happen if you had enough self-confidence to start a conversation with that person you noticed at random. And the icing on the cake is the beautiful backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. This only adds to the sentiment of romantic nirvana suggested by the film. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I do not think I'll get tired one day.
