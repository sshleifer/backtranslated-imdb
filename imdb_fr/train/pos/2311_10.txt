Reese Witherspooon's debut film. Loved The plot and the acting of the actors were top. You are emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion, to see absolutely. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you'll understand why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful. <br /> <br /> Other members of the cast also do a great job. <br /> <br /> The film flows extremely well. There is not a boring moment in the whole picture. The length of the man in the moon is right. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this film was excellent. I have seen it many times and I enjoyed each of the views.
