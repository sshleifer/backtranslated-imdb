What a masterpiece. Take the Cold War conflict and carry it into the future. This film is a satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, he exceeds Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> The intelligent name of the two superpowers, namely the Confederation and the market. The disadvantages being commies and market, the west! exceptional. The clever use of gen Joxs was ahead of its time. only do we really see the dangers of genetic engineering. The robots tackled the issue head-on in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message in this film is about the camaraderie of the humble man and how he can defeat the wishes of the government. This film shouts DO NOT DO IT YOU CAN KILL ALL US. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
