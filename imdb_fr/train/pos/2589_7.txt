The brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) do not fight only for Debra Winger's affections but for a secret of their childhood that left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surrealist touches (firefighters acting like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor, wit and romance. The soundtrack is great too. And similar to the way American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), making his own band- announces a rockin 'too' She's a lady '~ invaluable;) <br /> <br /> The best missing line from the section quotes btw ~' Once you've had a clown, you never come back! '<br /> <br /> I like this movie product (I just ordered the DVD in the US) and if the comments written by the kind of people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3 do not put you off tension ~ try it :)
