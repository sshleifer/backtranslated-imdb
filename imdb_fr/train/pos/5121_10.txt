I am a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger played at above average prices, I think the ensembles were representative of the place and time, I liked the soundtrack and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think the photography was amazing! Since the indoor scenes were filmed in the current club and Gilley had low ceilings - maybe 10 to 12 feet high and the smoke supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar" was hanging 2 to 4 feet below the ceiling. ceiling. The camera managed to take pictures in the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the low level of light that was actually in the bar! What an exploit! Of course, there was auxiliary lighting, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low-light shots. Ray Villalobos (the cameraman) was exceptional! He had clich√©s that he had no hope of achieving and their impact brought a sense of reality to the film. Thanks, Ray - Great job!
