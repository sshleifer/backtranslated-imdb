Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner then continued "The Baron" with this fantastic series featuring three superhuman spies that preceded "The Six Million Dollar Man". It was one of my favorites when I was young and I like to watch it again. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an undeniable chemistry on screen with Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the succulent Alexandra Bastedo pouted in his role of Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully gruffy Tremayne. The best episodes were by far those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's "The Interrogation" compared favorably to "The Prisoner". I regret that there has never been a second series; the concept had so much life in it. Would Craig and Richard have been competing for Sharron's affections? What if Tremayne had learned the powers of the champions? Did the champions have other abilities than the ones we saw? We have never discovered, alas.
