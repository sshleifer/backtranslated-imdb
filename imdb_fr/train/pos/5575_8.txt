I did not expect much, but I must admit that I rolled on the floor laughing a few times during the film. If you are not roughly offended in the first ten minutes, this could be a movie for you. Ditto if you're one to like watching Amanda Peet brewing cards for an hour and a half. This is certainly not a major comedy work, but, given the limited budget of indy Genesis, it's masterful. To level the playing field in terms of comparison, imagine all the studio movies whose budget is divided by about 100 and see what you will get! Congratulations to Peter Cohen and his network for completing this task. I look forward to his next effort.
