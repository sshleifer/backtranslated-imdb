Personally, it's one of my favorites of all time! no, i'm not 10 .. i'm 30 years old! I own an old original VHS that I bought at a rental store. I've watched it countless times .. <br /> <br /> Although it's a fun movie for kids, it's an intriguing movie for adults. I already saw this movie while I was .. not sober. my eyes were open to things I had never noticed before. I have seen morality strongly encouraged, both openly and somewhat subliminally. I wish I could remember everything that I noticed in particular, but it's been a long time since. Rest assured, there are TONS of things that are alluded to throughout the film. if you have the chance to see it .. not sober .. do it, you will not be disappointed .. in fact, you will probably feel rather happy and warm. <br /> <br /> unique and wonderful!
