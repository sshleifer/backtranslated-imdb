As for fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that made you cry the most. Poor Cinderella is a girl who was robbed all her life by two mean and ugly half-sisters and a slave mother-in-law. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, we could see Cinderella in animation. <br /> <br /> Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are alone and rich beyond their needs. To share her wealth and give sisters to her daughter, Cinderella's father marries a woman but dies shortly thereafter. the mother-in-law, seeing only dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her beautiful daughter-in-law, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is therefore a slave to her stepmother and half-sisters for several days. she has hope, however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the house (it looks like Cinderella was not playing with a full game), she hopes to one day find her prince. luck finally happens when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 9/10
