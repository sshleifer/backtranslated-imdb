I loved! What does not love? - you have your suburbs, your zombies, your family problems, your social dilemmas, you yourself have a beautiful retro 1950s style that eats its flesh in a classroom held at the bay by a worried worried About they are the next Superior Crust meal. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> The distribution is superb. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a beginner social climbing housewife. She is both shameless and criminal conspirator. The dream of every man. K'sun is really great because his son is just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence and succeed in one way or another. It is a real presence on the screen. Very photogenic and natural. Without all the names, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny embodies a suspicious policeman, with sharp instinct and lack of lightness, as if it were his everyday character. Billy Connolly is delicious like Fido. A good actor: I would have liked him to play the lead role in "Braveheart", under the direction of Gibson. My feeling is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the real character. His Fido is content, but accessible. A nice touch. <br /> <br /> In short, a great and wonderful satirical torment against morality, values, social pinning, feelings, growth, uncertain time management and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions. A real reality show.
