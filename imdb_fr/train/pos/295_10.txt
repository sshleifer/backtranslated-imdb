The little known Bogdonovich classic is a film like no other. A film that has the feel of a fairy tale, but has a solid foundation in reality because of its use of authentic Manhattan locales and "true" geography, perhaps the best filming location in New York that I never saw. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob), he can be brilliant and that the whole is a group you would like him to really exist so that you can spend time with them . One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that does not seem like a scam, it's the culmination of Bogdanovich's fruitful career after his "success", when his best work was truly accomplished ("St. Jack") , "finally ...", "extinguished noises".
