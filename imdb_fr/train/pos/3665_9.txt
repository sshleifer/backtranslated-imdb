They did it. And, boy, did they do it wonderfully or what? The BBC finally brought the Doctor back to our screens on a Saturday night where he belongs! And they did it in style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose" - One of the highlights of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the series and knows what other fans want, but is also an experienced writer and knows what others want. Another strength, as this first episode perfectly shows, is Billie Piper and her character Rose Tyler. Finally, the doctor's companion gets a credible story and a strong character. Also nice to see the return of the Autons - a nice nod to the classic series. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWO: "The end of the world" - At the beginning of this double bill to show the TARDIS "Assets, we find ourselves in a story where special effects do everything! They now have the technology to create real and believable environments and monsters - no more rubber suits! Also hints at the end of this episode regarding the Doctor's new past - very intriguing to kill all the Lords of Time and make it the only one. <br /> <br /> EPISODE THREE: "The Unquiet Dead" - We 'We had the future, let's move on to the past. The first episode not written by Davies is a little flat in some places, but that's what Charles Dickens Simon Callow does and the abrupt reversal of the plot when it is revealed that the pitiful Gelf is not so pitiful after all ... <EPISODE FOUR: "Aliens Of London" - The consequences of the actions of the doctor are fully explored in this series, especially with the repercussions of Rose's flight with him. In addition, we have our first cliffhanger; not the best of the real ones. Slitheen are an interesting villain, but they can seem too complex for their own good. <br /> <br /> EPISODE FIVE: "Third World War" - The second part of this story about Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems of the first. In addition, the clips of the next episode at the end of the current episode are annoying and ruin everyone. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SIX: "Dalek" - Yes! We had the future, the past and the present (ish), but now we come to the right things - the return of the arch-nemesis of the Doctor. Here, I think we can complete Christopher Ecclestone - he was brilliant as a Doctor, and no more so in this episode, where we see the pain on his face as he remembers the War of Time and his alien nature as he almost turns into a Dalek himself. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVEN: "The Long Game" - This is actually just a story to play as a prologue for the series finale. Saved by Simon Pegg as Editor and Tamsin Grieg in a fun cameo. The media are controlling us - this has never been done before, is not it ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day" - it's a big episode. Full of human emotion and heartache for Rose, and real consequences of what happens when you destroy the story. Congratulations to Billie Piper. <br /> <br /> NEW EPISODE: "The empty child" - I do not find this kid very scary. Sorry, but not me. It's a good episode, though, but the cliffhanger could have been better - it's these "Next Time" bits that ruin them. John Barrowman is featured here as Captain Jack, the seductive conman - a good actor who has been around for a while, but who seems to have noticed him now. <br /> <br /> TEN EPISODE: "The Doctor Dances" - Second part of this document History of the Second World War - very well done in terms of historical context. A nice optimistic end, but a bit confusing perhaps for the youngest when the "Mom" will be revealed? <br /> <br /> EPISODE EZ: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest of the series, but that does not mean that it is bad. A nice come back for the Slitheen and also an interesting character study between the Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - it starts off stupidly, with a little cheerful humor and an insolent fun at popular TV shows on her in Blighty. Things are moving quickly, and the final revelation is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /> <br /> THRITEEN EPISODE: "The separation of paths" - Bye Christopher Ecclestone. A fantastic doctor in many ways, David Tennant really has to work to be as good as he is. The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. Oh, and the Daleks are back - to the extreme! May God bless CGI because they could never do it normally! <br /> <br /> Overall - great! 9/10
