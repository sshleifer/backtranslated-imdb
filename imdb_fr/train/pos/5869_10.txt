after watching The Deer Hunter, a masterpiece, the Jacknife movie had big shoes to fill. It takes the same themes as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this film, as in The Deer Hunter and is very good here, as is Kathy Baker. This film however belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a powerful, moving and percussive performance. The film is based on a play and includes one or two scenes. It seemed obvious to me. By that, I just wanted to say that for these scenes, it seemed to me that I was watching a play. It was not that bad, and it did not really diminish the movie. this movie.it is not an epic like The Deer Hunter.This is an era and similar themes, but these are two very different movies.I thought The Deer Hunter was great, and I think also that this movie was awesome.It plays the role of actor in this one that makes it so great.For me, Jacknife is a 10/10
