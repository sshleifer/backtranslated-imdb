Kurt Russell, whose career began when he launched the TRUE Elvis in It Happened at the World's Fair, will probably never outperform his performance as the king of this biopic, barred by Carpenter's slash and shock. . You sometimes have the feeling of watching Elvis until something brings you back to reality ... maybe memories of the unfortunate Don Johnson in Elvis and the beauty queen? All performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nervousness and hysteria to his rendition of Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's father, Bing, plays here Elvis's father, Vernon, and Robert Gray, Elvis's boyfriend and bodyguard, Red West, offer a nice sober performance. <br /> <br /> A must for rock n roll fans.
