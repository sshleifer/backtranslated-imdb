I just watched all 6 episodes on DVD. The acting is excellent - no question. I must say there was not enough action for me. No real suspense as such, but a lot of first-class character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you like to tell a good story slowly and carefully, it's for you. Peter Egan in the lead role of Magnus Pym is excellent. <br /> <br /> The film describes the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British intelligence service, but who had been so psychologically damaged by his unhappy childhood that deception had become his way of life in all things. As a child, he adored his father but he was exposed as a crook and a crook. Pym did not betray his ideology or his money, but because he needed to deceive his relatives (wife, son, mentor). Pym is fatally affected by his father's influence - he has eaten away his moral fiber. He has no sincere love or loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> Big psychological stuff and few moments of light in the 6-hour series. Very well done though.
