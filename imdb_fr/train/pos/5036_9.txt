Bill Paxton, of the Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as a director for Frailty. It hits all the cylinders, but there is an implausibility close to the end that involves the FBI agent (Powers Booth), who deducts a point from this crippling and provoking thriller. Apart from that, this film was going very well. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays daddy. He has never been given a name, but it is not a weakness of the film. In fact, it reinforces the film by allowing the viewer to see it as a kind of symbol. One day he has a vision which, he says, was sent by God and tells him that the world is coming to an end. His two sons, Fenton Meiks (Matt OLeary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) and his two sons must both condemn the demons and kill them. . The demons look like normal people they kill, and the viewer then wonders if dad has just lost his mind or is really doing God's work. There are scenes that reflect the two points, which adds to the confusion and gives more suspense to the film. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now an adult (Matthew McConaughey) and who speaks with FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) who is very skeptical and rightly. After all, it's not every day that someone comes to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is. <br /> <br /> The film has many twists and Bill Paxton directs wonderfully well by letting us guess without losing any interest. The acting is incredible. The two young leaders and Paxton work very well together, they look like a normal family, even if they are all involved in a murder. As I said, the implausibility of the Powers Booth character is incredible, but it's not really bad. It was an extremely well done film involving faith and family.
