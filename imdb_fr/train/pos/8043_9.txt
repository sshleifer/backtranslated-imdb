I have heard people say that this film is dull, drab, dull. I do not think they were watching the good movie. Thank God, this is not the typical action movie. <br /> <br /> It's a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that is about killing people. In this way, it works extremely well, with amazing performances by Berenger and Zane (who does not work like in a film like he did in other roles - he really seems to be acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. with the action towards the end - a lot of that did not make much sense and was not satisfactory given the accumulation of the rest of the film. But watch Zane's face panic, alone, while Berenger does the dirty work.
