Well, I said everything in the summary, I love the film and the cast ... I would give each actor an Oscar ... great, great movie ... I'm 25 now and I'm have watched 4 times in different times and I still think I will not cry and I always do it, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s. was absolutely brilliant, Jeremy irons too..just! I wish the film received more awards ... I really do not know anyone who watched it and did not like it ... Moreover, Glenn Close was fantastic. .. The story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I liked the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much, and as Blanca was close to his parents ...
