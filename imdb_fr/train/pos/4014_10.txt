Spoiler for all those lucky enough to see this movie (so not really spoiler after all). I saw this film when it came out and it can still retain some parts. Everything happens in a small town in the west or in what is left of this city. It's more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them, a couple where the woman is particularly nasty. She lets her man die at the end of the film and leaves the city but has to cross the desert. We never know what will happen to her next, but just before leaving her dying, she shoots after her and does not hit her deliberately, but rather at the water supply. She does not realize that soon she will be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills some bad guys in a funny mansion - but that's another story, which I do not remember too well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really nasty woman on the film, who claimed to be anything but nasty - could not be compared to the 'Snowwhite' witch, who in comparison, easy to discover. Western very tight with some main characters and always absorbing.
