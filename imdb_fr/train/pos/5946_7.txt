"World's Finest" is a unique project. This is a trailer for a Superman / Batman crossover movie that does not exist and will never exist either, at least in this form, with these characters, actors and plot anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie is a big tease, even more than the standards of real daily trailers. The trailer will beat you for nothing. In this respect, I really did not like this short project. When you watch this trailer, it makes you hungry and excited at the same time and at the same time sad and maybe even will you feel cheated afterwards, when it turns out that a full movie of this band- announcement will never exist. In a way, one wonders why this project was done in the first place. To show the skills of Sandy Collora, but could not it have done so with a real short film, like his previous movie "Batman: Dead End". <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this short film for what it is, so from a film technical point of view, it's really a super. It is beautiful and much more professional than you might think at first, although those who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" already know better than to wait for a short film with cardboard sets, costumes cheap homemade facts and evaluate the actors. The short film is not always impressive and the budget is obviously not very high, but it is usually very impressive and professional, with pretty costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> In short, a quick and typical trailer is built, with perhaps too many shots too credible, but hey, it works well for the style of the trailer. There are some impressive shots but also some bad ones, mainly the Superman flight sequences. It was obvious that the guy was standing right in front of a moving car, with a camera pointing at him from an angle. I even found it rather laughable to watch. But the best and most spectacular moments really make up for that. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn seemed to be a very good Superman / Clark Kent, although he is obviously not the most talented actor of the moment. Clark Bartram resumes his role in Batman and Kurt Carley seemed to be an impressive Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast also performed well. <br /> <br /> It is particularly interesting to see this short film after the recent modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this film, in the films "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". It is interesting to compare the style and the treatment of the characters of these films with this one. It's really amazing and fun to hear how Kurt Carley looks like Kevin Spacey, the actor who played the role of Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> This is a good quality trailer, well made and built, that makes you hungry for more, even if you know there will be more. What happened to the plans of Waner Bros. to create a complete Superman / Batman movie, by the way? I thought that developments were under way for that a few years ago, but we have not heard about it since. Instead, two new separate Batman and Superman movies were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
