Powerful mobile suits capable of annihilating entire armies - Check! Guns that barely need to be targeted and still cancel everything - Check! Angel-based mobile suits - Check! <br /> <br /> OK - it's a Gundam series. This one, Gundam Wing, has a good character development, a real-world complexity, interesting ideas and pretty miracles for the eyes. <br /> <br /> With the characters, Relena Dorlan, initially weak (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) becomes stronger and more independent (although he is still absolutely fascinated by Heero Yuy, the main character from the Serie). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold and hard butcher, becomes more and more human, while remaining in the character. And see the late Millardo Peacecraft (whose war leader is Zechs Marquise) floating between OZ, independent and the command of Croc-White shows how some people can really get lost in their own creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting the functioning of the real world. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it becomes a bit awkward as this complexity is not used to its full potential. <br /> <br /> The ideas at the heart of the series - the need for fighting, the desire for peace, etc., still resonate today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, including the "war on terror". But his exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible drama, constituting one of the best writings in the series. <br /> <br /> But this sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor, which makes him lose part of his advantage. <br /> <br /> Regarding the pleasure of the eyes, as evidenced by this one in case of nonsense, everything, mobile suits to the Libra battleship (No not the silly pads!) is well designed, and explodes in big balls of orange (which is bad, because a better animation would have had better explosions). But who cares?! The material explodes and that's all that matters. <br /> <br /> In short, the complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you miss a lot. Wrong writing can leave you shuddering, and sometimes the animation makes you switch to "WTF?!?!" But this is offset by its classic style of animation, its size, its sparks of incredible dialogue and its more mature exploration that is expected of such Japanese animations.
