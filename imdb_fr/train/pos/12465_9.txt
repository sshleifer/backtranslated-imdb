I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Council Prize in 1978 and is a very interesting reading (unintentional word game). It's not too hard to read for those who do not read often, so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture the passion of relationships more than the film and the film will make more sense after reading the book. Having grown up in Melbourne, I could really understand this book and this movie. Very few Australian women writers were in the 70s, so very little information is given about a woman's lifestyle in an Australian urban city during this period or this class. It's a precious piece of Melbourne history. It's a pity that it's documented as a kind of 80s soft porn movie. It's far from it and, as the other reviewer has said, do not read the DVD cover, it does not represent the content of the film. Those who rent the movie based on this description will be disappointed. Remember that this film was shot in 1982, so do not expect the Hollywood dramatization that they seem to incorporate nowadays. That's what I like about it. It is also a pleasure to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role. She's just fantastic as Nora and she's great to see her play real. Indeed, if you are almost my age, you will remember her for her stays in Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she was hiding this talent? This movie will give you a whole new impression of her. A classic Australian story!
