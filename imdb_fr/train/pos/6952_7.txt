This romantic comedy-adventure has a lot of hilarious moments and is very entertaining. Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot, Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual and Uma Thurman is great in the role of a disturbed neurotic superhero reminiscent of Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" or Evelyn Draper in "Play Misty For Me".
