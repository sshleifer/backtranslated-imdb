so in the middle of the season, I got so caught up in school and my activities that I did not know that the show had been canceled in the middle, which is shit. <br /> <br /> I think fans of this show should write Fox and ask them to finish at least the shoot so that the season can be broadcast later on DVD. maybe they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive its first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the series and eagerly wait for it every Thursday after the CO. can you imagine my disappointment when I came back to watch the show and discover that it was gone? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with the fox right now. even more after discovering that NO ENDING Was Was Filmed. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what's going on. a half-filmed show is like a car half done, it's almost useless. Fox, film the end of this damn trick and give a little peace to fans of the series.
