The first time I saw this movie, I liked it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (believer in the Bible). I do not go with the crowd of right-wingers. I came out of this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me, in their attempts to take control of our government, they are doing what Judas has been trying to do. I call this the Judas syndrome. <br /> <br /> Judas did not understand it, even though Jesus declared that his kingdom was not of this world. <br /> <br /> This film certainly showed some of it. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoys the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> He was also a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> It's a surveillance film. <br /> <br /> Very satisfying.
