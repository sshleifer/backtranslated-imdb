I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if it looks like them, I did not notice it. I like the quality of the narration of cinematography. I even like the love story, even though I appreciate it, I wonder deep down how devil this part of the story can really develop since Ned can not touch Chuck or otherwise ... well, you know. I even like Chuck, I do not find it boring at all, and I usually hate characters that are too nice, kind and perfect. I even like the narrator's voice, even if it disturbs a member of my family and looks like some Walgreens ads. I could nibble all the other things about Ned's predicament and how the writers will tackle it in the future, but I'd rather watch and wait to see what the writers are saying.
