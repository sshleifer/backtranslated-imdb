THE ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always think that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the "strange couple" par excellence. Their incredible work on the television series from the beginning to the mid-seventies was a hit for television of the day ... easily surpassing the versions of the story on stage and on screen. Nevertheless, how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau couple? Matthau is particularly shaped like Oscar, the slob. Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you've already seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance. The scenario is good ... definitely the best of Neil Simon. (I'll note here that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst drama writers in American theater.) The story is simple: Felix, a clean maniac and recently separated from his wife settles with Oscar, the slob who needs help save money for child support payments. Their way of life also looks a lot like a wedding, resulting in fun tiffs and jaws. A lot of fun and excellent one-liners.
