Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with deft spoonful of suspense. In one way or another, a Martian sneaked aboard a broken bus en route to nowhere, but what passenger is he (talk about your illegal immigrants!). The cast of stars, from Jack Elam with wild eyes (the shameless hammering), to the sexy Jean Willes (if she is Martian, then I say: let's open the borders!), To the cruel John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect) , with familiar faces, John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as a bus driver). It's a half hour very entertaining even if the action is limited to one set.
