I saw the movie Freebird and I think it's great! It's fun, it's time for the British film industry to do something entertaining !! It's good how the guy who met them at the gas station is mentioned in the movie by the press agents, nice contact. The acting was convincing (I'm a biker), they reminded me of some good times spent in the bike world. It was good to see the director enter the acting, bravo jon! In the end, a new culture is mentioned. In Ireland, is it the foundation of a second film? so hopefully keep them coming. Great movie, well written, realistic characters!
