the photography was beautiful but I could not understand what was happening ... was there a lot of symbolism? ... the 2 goldfish - do they mean anything in Thai culture? there is not a lot of conspiracy, not a lot of things going on and it's going on. no real beginning, no real environment and no real end. rather unsatisfactory really. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to get into the characters, because you never thought you knew them ... it was difficult to know what scenes were imaginary and what scenes were real. The move was chaotic and disjointed. I do not know what the Pang brothers were hoping to achieve. Maybe if I were Thai, it would make more sense ...
