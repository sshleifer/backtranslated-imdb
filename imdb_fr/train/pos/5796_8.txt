Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music film starring Michael Jackson with different segments. I will note each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with a music video. The video clip is a concert of Michael Jackson performing the song "Man in the Mirror". The clip also features historical characters such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open the movie. I liked the song and the editing of the historical characters. I even loved the message of the song. I give a 9/10 to the first segment. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a montage of Michael Jackson's departure from the Jackson Five to his solo career. The editing that I found well done, I liked the animation that they put there and I also liked their choice of songs such as "II you back, Beat it, Thriller, can you the to feel and how you feel it? " The only thing I would have liked them to do a little better in one of the songs of the editing is "We are the world". The reason you only see raindrops is a picture of Michael Jackson and the chorus of celebrities, but it's a bit difficult to see the chorus. Apart from that, the segment is always good. I give it a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the Bad song. You probably think Michael Jackson's music video is bad, well yes and no. This segment is the music video, but it was redone by children. The segment was cute but it was not as good as the other segments. I give it a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short film from Claymation Music that takes place after the children's version of "Bad Demon". The short film tells that Michael Jackson is hunted by his beloved fans and by the press. He disguises himself as a rabbit and drives a motorcycle to try to escape. The clay sequence in the chase sequence was excellent, but some parts of the movie, Claymation's characters looked a bit wrong when they interacted with real people. Also at the end of the clip, out of nowhere, Michael Jackson's bunny costume comes alive and he dances with it. I liked the dance but it was like going out of nowhere. I'm giving him an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy-winning videoclip, "Leave me alone". The music video talks about the media mocking Michael Jackson's personal life and Michael Jackson thinks they will not leave him alone, no matter how innocent he was. The music video really speaks (but keep in mind what happened before child abuse is just about the rumors of it in the 80s), but I did not think this video should be in this movie because it's a children's movie and I do not think children will understand what it's about. I give this video clip 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole film titled "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his star powers to protect the children (including son of John Lennon, Sean Lennon) from an evil named Mr Bigg (played by Joe Pesci). The segment that I really thought came out of the movie especially when he danced and sang the song "Smooth Criminal" with a group of criminals. I also thought that the special effects were good. The strange thing about this segment is why children hang out with an adult man without ever explaining why. Joe Pesci's character also talks about Drugs and what he plans to do with them. Why do you want to talk about drugs in a children's movie? Otherwise it was good. My rating for this segment is 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the last segment of the entire movie. The film ends with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of the Beatles song "Come Together," and then during the credits, we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael made a good cover of "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to put a group of good singers with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie. I think it really arouses the imagination of children. The film is almost as imaginative as the Beatles movie "Yellow Submarine" if you like Michael Jackson and you're ready for a movie with a lot of creativity, it's the movie. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
