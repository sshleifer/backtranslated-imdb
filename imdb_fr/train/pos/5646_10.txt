Recently, when I was doing my shopping, I saw the box of the American Gothic and I thought: "I remember it!" I used to set my alarm clock to get up and look at him when he was on the CH 4 in 1996 at 1:30 am (I was 14 years old). I mostly remember it because it was really scary and weird, no one could be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B !!) No one has ever been anyway. <br /> <br /> What annoys me is that they do the same thing as when they are on TV. The episodes in a funny order, I thought when will Dr. Matt leave ??? - They made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, it's not the fault of screenwriters, producers or directors (its TV hosts in the background of silver makers) They always do the same thing - just watch series like Carnivale and Farscape that do not like originality in the studios !!!!! <br /> <br /> To finish - If you have not seen it and your name is a fantasy sci-fi, a horror, a supernatural drama..Fan = YOU MUST. They even said the same thing in SFX during the cabinet review.
