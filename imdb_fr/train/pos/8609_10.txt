I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was a beautiful story that showed that people are so complex in all sorts of ways. I recommended it to all my friends !! I always enjoy a good story and this movie has one of the best I've seen in a long time. I saw myself having a daughter and doing the same things as Natalie to know more about her life and loves. It showed that not only were we living with our families; but we also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them - for it may not be in their interest to know all the details of the things we do not do and of which we are so proud. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see another movie of this kind and I will keep an eye on myself.
