My brothers and sisters and I stumbled on The Champions when our local channel aired reruns one summer in the 1970s. We absolutely loved it. There was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially compared to the usual American reruns (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you see the idea). It was very similar to The Avengers (not too surprising, as it was also British and in the spy / adventure genre). <br /> <br /> I would love to see him again now. I hope that will be the case. resists. I have talked about this series to others and no one has ever heard of it, so I wondered if I had imagined its whole existence. But the wonder of the Web has allowed me to find information about it. Let's hope he finds a new generation of fans.
