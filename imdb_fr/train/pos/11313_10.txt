Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and beautiful vagabond who arrives in a road bar. He meets the young, beautiful and unsatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband, Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), owners of the bar. He trades his mechanical skills for food and housing and has an affair with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe, causing a car accident. The relationship between them becomes affected by the feeling of guilt and the investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends tragically. The black and neo-realistic film by Luchino Visconti is remarkable. This is the first time I watch this version of "The postman always rings twice". I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in film history, but this is certainly the best. My vote is ten.
