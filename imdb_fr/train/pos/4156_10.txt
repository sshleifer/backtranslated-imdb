I have watched many episodes of Cold Case since its inception (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but it was one of the best examples of writing and acting I've seen of Bruckheimer's house, the script and editing, the soundtrack and the acting set made this episode an equal, and if I was the producer, I would submit this episode to Emmy's consideration. We did the portrait of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of this 48-minute episode, which requires a lot of talent to do his best, and I hope it's time to warn when this episode is repeating itself. I did not notice the first time.
