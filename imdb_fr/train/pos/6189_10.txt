Who would have imagined - Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his idiosyncratic style. The fusion is very funny. <br /> <br /> Having not seen a Hal Hartley movie for about a decade, I approached it with caution. His brilliant productions of the 90s impressed critics and the public with their unique style and dialogue. The director's previous films featured colorful characters and meticulous observations of life - often in the Long Island area, New York or New York itself - that were offbeat and insightful. <br /> <br /> My first warning comes from the description of this film as a "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to reconcile his well-established style and purpose to produce a very original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one could imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialogue and focus on the character that are his trademark, with a singular cinematic style. <br /> <br /> In addition, it fits perfectly given the current situation in the world and the state of war favored by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of mention in the same breath as Syriana. Really, he comes in his own. The cast interprets Hartley's vision and style very well. Fans of Parker Posey will see it in full bloom here, always with us and more mature and more beautiful than before.
