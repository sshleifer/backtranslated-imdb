More and more filmmakers like Nacho Vigalondo need a bigger outlet for their talents. 7:35 AM: Ma√±ana is an absolute genius. What Nacho is able to transmit in 8 minutes asks Hollywood filmmakers hours of film to make. I looked at it smiling, but feeling a little dirty and not sexually. You sit down and wonder how you should feel after watching these 8 minutes. nugget. I had fun, but I was disturbed at the same time. Few people can do it in just 8 minutes. It starts quite simple. A young woman comes to have breakfast at home. She sits down and someone starts to sing. From there, the film takes you into so many different emotions that it's hard to describe. It's in black and white, but it helps to give the impression that the film gives you. This film makes you want to know more about the characters, how they interacted before and how the end affected their life after. I guess that sounds like the old adage, "Let them ask for more," Nacho Vigalondo is able to do. Look at it when you can. Show it to your friends and ask yourself how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes.
