It's a pretty little horror parody featuring Cassandra Peterson, aka Elvira: The Mistress of Darkness, the most infamous hostess of horror of all time. It was a pilot vehicle for Elvira and its success was such that it was taken over by the NBC network. They filmed a pilot for a television series featuring the busty girl in black, but unfortunately the sit-com never went beyond the pilot's stage because of his sexual references. This film is however very amusing. Elvira is the modern-day Morgan Chesty and the queen of one-liners. This film was followed a few years later by the abominable "The Haunted Hills of Elvira", supposed to be a takeoff of Roger Corman's old movies but which falls flat on his stomach. Instead, watch this movie for a much more entertaining experience!
