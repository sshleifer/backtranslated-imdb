It was fabulous! Photography, editing, cinematography, music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the pleasure of falling, without going through the danger. We were there! Dream sequences and backtracking sequences were cool. That spoke to me. Keep up the good work! Another of this kind is City of God. Also - do not laugh! - comedy, desperately looking for Susan. Beautiful types of sets, with excellent performances of all. Sorry, I think Training Day also fits this genre, with fantastic performances from a group. I had to change channels for some difficult sequences, but a great movie!
