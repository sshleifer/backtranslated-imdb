Even if this movie is old enough, no matter how many times I watch it, it makes me laugh again. <br /> <br /> A special quote from the film stands out. <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) goes to the prosecutor's office and parks in a disabled place, Danny's partner says that <br /> <br /> "can not park here it's for the handicapped ". <br /> <br /> Danny answers "I am handicapped, I am psychotic". <br /> <br /> this is one of the many lines in the movie that says no matter how many times you watch, I'm going to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerously is in my top 5 comedy / parody movies of all time. <br /> <br /> As a bonus, it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in the throw. So watch this movie and like myself and many others who have watched it, you will be hooked.
