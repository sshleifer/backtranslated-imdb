A child with ideals who tries to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and violates the rights of existence. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, gets up and tells the truth. A family falling apart and fighting against it. A film that you can not hide. You see things and you hear things and you feel things that you hope will never happen until the day after your death. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything and a boy with, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who will not accept anything, who will not let anything happen to him, a child who has power, and a kid who acts like a pro, as if he had never done anything else, he leads this film to the end, and all those who want to see how the abuses found their place in the sixties.
