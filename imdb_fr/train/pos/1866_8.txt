A beautiful story, based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties on the road. Since this is Denzel Washington's first film he will make himself, I must admit that I was a little skeptical, but who would not be ...? But again, he is a great actor with many years of experience and the end result is excellent. The story is told in a positive way, making you who has had difficulties during your childhood and your young age, do you see in these situations. So it hits you hard, letting you know you're not the only one to go through hell. All in all, a touching story about a young man trying to survive in this damn world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of the film.) Highly recommended. 8/10
