Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an exceptional group of films that will live forever, as in "The Shop Around the Corner". This film was reworked into less distinguished films and a musical piece, without the charm or elegance of Mr. Lubitsch's clean and clean version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart have worked together in several films. Their characters in this film are an example of how to be in a movie without seeming to act. The two stars are delightful as correspondents who do not know each other, but who fate has made them work together in the same store in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason these classic films have worked so well is the amazing supporting molds the studios put up in the picture after the picture. Here we have the wonderful Frank Morgan playing the role of the store owner. We also see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing an impressive job to make us believe that they are actually in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That's why these movies will live forever. !
