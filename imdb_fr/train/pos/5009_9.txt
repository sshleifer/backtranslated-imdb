First special disc offered on the complex box "Barbra Streisand: special television shows", released last November, this disc is distributed separately for those who do not want to shell the five promotions. As an investment, it's the best of the group, if only because it's Streisand at its purest and most eager to impress. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key element of her legend. Signed in a long-term contract with CBS to produce one-hour variety shows, an almost extinct format nowadays, Streisand was 22 years old in this first CBS special show in April 1965. At that time of his career, his notoriety was limited to some hit albums, a few television appearances in variety shows and talk shows, and his Broadway hit in Funny Girl. <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, the program is divided into three distinct parts. With the creative transient use of "I'm Late" from Disney's "Alice in Wonderland", the first segment has been cleverly showing it since childhood through figures as diverse as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". ". Beginning with a comic monologue on Pearl from Istanbul, the second part moves into Manhattan's posh Bergdorf Goodman, where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing Depression songs, such as "Have Got Plenty of Nuthin ' "and" The best things in life are free "with comical irony. Returning to the roots, the third segment is an uninterrupted concert that opens with a torchlight version of "When the Sun Out", including a mix of "Funny Girl" and ends with its classic version and melancholy of "Happy Days Are Here". Again on the end credits, it also contains the brief introduction it recorded in 1986, when the special was first published on VHS For those who know Streisand only for its expensive concert tickets and her political fundraiser, this is a real revelation of why she is so venerated now.
