This movie was great and even with an unconvincing end, it's always worth seeing. The film begins as Claudette Colbert prepares to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, a guy gets up and announces that Colbert CAN NOT get married because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they investigate, they find that the justice of the peace and many others remember her marriage and that there is even a signed marriage license! Slowly, it becomes obvious that Claudette's mind is slipping and that people around her are seriously doubting her mental health. Then, when the supposed first husband is murdered, all the evidence and suspicion fall on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is a mysterious thriller, because what I have described so far is only the first half of the film. The following is incredibly intelligent and captivating. Unfortunately, the conclusion is a little disappointing, as the guiding force behind all this is revealed "out of the left field" - and is disconcerting because it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer. However, despite this, the movie was so good that I can even excuse the lame end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as a "fist-breaking fianc√©", though, aside from him, the other performances were also excellent.
