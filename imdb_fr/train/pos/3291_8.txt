It's a good movie, and a pity it receives little attention outside the circle of artists and students who stay awake until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but works very well, the blur between child fantasy and percussive nightmare is very vague. The budget seems rather low, but to the credit of the people involved, this is not seen too often. He does not have much seniority either. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to film this show a few years ago and she resisted half a dozen screenings. This is one of those movies that will not please everyone. even if, as usual, those who have a more thoughtful approach to cinema would benefit a lot. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke plays well as Anna, the spoiled girl and it's a shame that she seems to have started from the scene. Cross is also very good and carries very well the stature of his character in the context of the photo. <br /> <br /> There are truly disturbing moments (and I do not say that lightly) in this movie, both half-second shocks and longer tensions. Look at it with the lights off! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
