It was a real treat when this show was presented because it was such a fresh, innovative and original show. This makes every show I have ever watched banal boring. As soon as the first episode was aired, I was fascinated and attached to all the characters so easily (which never happens, because I still hate some characters). It is unfortunate that this series does not have a third season, because it must be one of the best series I have ever seen and it is not exaggerating what I feel for the series. Nothing can replace Pushing Daisies, because what could ABC find to replace this show? It's easily the best show on television. <br /> <br /> I came looking for Kristin Chenoweth and stayed because I fell in love with the show.
