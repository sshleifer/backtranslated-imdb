First of all, if you intend to look at this, make sure to look at the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and look at the corrupted scenes because of the censorship), makes a huge difference. This film tells the story of a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who, since the age of 14, is forced into prostitution by her own father. When her father suddenly dies, she is able to go out alone to the world. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophies on life, she uses her sexuality to incite men to give her what she wants and leaves them in shambles and desperate for her love. Throughout the film, she becomes more and more materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder if she still has a sense of morality. All in all, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant sexual scenes that most people would not expect to see in a black and white movie. Although no sexual act is explicitly shown on the screen, it is very obvious that what happens in front of the camera amazes me. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I think the most modern audience will get at least a bit of fun if it, especially with the shock value of the movies. Looking at this, I thought the pace seemed a bit slow, but I think most movies the first time is to see them. In fact, I think almost every film I saw in the early 1930s had minor pacing problems or some parts just did not work properly. It was probably fair that the art of cinema was not quite perfect yet ?? it would only take a few more years. Compare a 1939 film and compare it with a film from the early '30s and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I am very happy to have been able to watch the original version; it really makes a big difference. In addition, all fans of John Wayne will be surprised to see him in this film before he is famous in an unusual role.
