Robert De Niro, Gooding Jr. Cuba, Hal Holbrook and all the other actors and actresses of "Men of Honor" have joined forces to make a good movie. Mark Isham wrote the movie, so you know that the music is really good too. <br /> <br /> But after noticing a bunch of gaffes, loopholes and dramatic dramas, from the beginning, I vowed to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. If you can do it, it's really good. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a realistic hero, is inspiring enough to last a lifetime. Watch it on the Internet ... The whole story is more amazing than the movie, as the director acknowledged in his comments. There were only three African American divers from the US Navy in World War II. However, none has reached the status of US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first diver of the US Navy of African-American origin. AND he was the first amputee diver to be certified or recertified as a diver in the US Navy. (Loud applause). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the movie diary: should I talk to you about a single "escape"? Yes, I will mark this comment as containing "spoilers" and do it ... The first crucial scene where the helicopter hits the mast of the radio and sinks into the sea: they would never have had time to Full dress Mark V diver, even though he was the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday, in time to save only "a few minutes late", thus saving the driver. <br /> <br /> So, for loopholes, blunders, and over-dramatization, I go from 10 to 7 to "Men of Honor". <br /> <br /> Will Hollywood realize that unmixed truth is so much better than their overly dramatic approach to storytelling? I doubt. Pity!
