"Almost nothing" tells the story of two young boys who fell in love with summer at the seaside. I do not want to tell the plot, because it is not what is most important in this film (but you can be sure that it is interesting and original). The best part of this movie is cinematography. The visual side of "Almost nothing" is so incredible that it deserves the highest rating. He leaves you charmed by his beauty. <br /> <br /> The plot is presented in an uneven and rather complicated way. There is no simple timeline or answers to all the questions raised by the film. But that's what makes "Almost anything" even more interesting. I recommend this film to all those for whom the artistic side of the films is very important and they will not be disappointed.
