In the ten years since Wildside's release, nothing has been comparable to its quality in local production. This includes the two series of Underbelly, a pleasant but overrated activity, which shed light on the recent criminal history of Sydney and Melbourne. The Blue Murder miniseries (who also starred in Tony Martin, but as a person on the other side of the law) could be an exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is currently being rehearsed late at night on the ABC channel. Having not watched the show for a long time, I'm always impressed by its uncompromising story and very human characters. The distribution is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later met Martin in real life) as a community agent struggling with alcoholism and Alex Dimitriades as that young policeman whose vice is the game. Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie herself) and a young Abbie Cornish also play an equally interesting supporting role. <br /> <br /> The ABC has inexplicably published only the first three episodes on DVD. years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is beyond me, but I imagine it could be related to licensing disputes with the original producers. <br /> <br /> An excellent series that has remarkably aged well. Hoping that the ABC DVD service is doing well. <br /> <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC bulletin board, a DVD release is planned for December 2009)
