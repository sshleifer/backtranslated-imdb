... and if you are really good, it will look like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a silly story, but it was a fantasy after all, and the casting and acting were Spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / imposter, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine to have for the actors. You have a glimpse of what actors are behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> It was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just as his character perfectly embodies the dead dictator! And the separation scene: a bit like Casablanca! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was superb as a leader of the secret Paradorian police. He receives some really funny replicas, some of which are tributes to other films, like "Gather the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was excellent as a girlfriend - besides being a very hot figure: "You should get an Oscar for tonight!" <br /> <br /> Do not forget Johnny Winters as a CIA agent and the many stars invited: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas and Dick Cavett - all perfectly accomplished. <br /> <br /> All in all, a memorable frenzy under the Paradorian moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
