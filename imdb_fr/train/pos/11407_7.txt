updated on January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> To be more specific, Parsifal is one of my favorite musical operas or dramas of Wagner, (Meistersinger is the other.) although it is difficult to imagine it as the top of anyone. As usual, the composer's libretto is a mixture of religion, paganism, eroticism and perhaps even homo-eroticism, and its length can give the audience the impression that it is difficult to listen to the painting. <br /> <br /> Wagner, being a famous anti-Semite (Klingsor is perhaps one of his wicked Jewish substitutes), naturally entrusted the creation to an unconverted (this is is not having tried RW!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite chef! (Go understand!) Kundry, a mixed-race Métis mother and probably a Jewish surrogate, is both vile and benevolent, depending on the scene. br /> <br /> Since many video versions of Parsifal look gloomy Côté, this opera film is, by comparison, a breath of fresh air, and Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, the director, a great imagination, but it's hard to know why he made some of his choices, for example: the famous double Parsifals (of each sex!), the puppets, the Wagner mask-death mask and various dolls and symbols such as the Nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes. (If I remember correctly, the "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote the current music to underline the scene changes.) Although Wagner himself died much too early to be a true Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife, Cosima.) were at least fellow travelers, including their grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who still runs the Bayreuth festival at an advanced age. In fact, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, totally opposed to his father, tried to get along honestly with his great-grandfather. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically ambiguous from what I read. In 1977, he made a film about Hitler, "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (sometimes called "Our Hitler" in English.). Since it lasts 8 hours and has not been widely distributed, most people have not seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the conductor of the audio CD on which this film is based, plays Amfortas (played by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick perform double Parsifals (played by Reiner Goldberg.!) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland perform and interpret Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period and all (except Kundry?) have been described as having aged considerably between acts 2 and 3, no one seems to have one more day in the end of the month. opera. In this opera, the Grail is the cup Jesus drank at the Last Supper and not Mary Magdalene, as in more recent times, an idea that I find absurd!). <br /> <br /> direction and singing are all very useful and the DVD seems to have improved the sound, if not the image, to a large extent. (Yes, I agree that the "Kna" approach is superior, even on the second stereo version, but it is probably superior to all recorded versions.) <br /> <br /> Not a Parsifal for all Wagnerians but I think it works pretty well as a film opera.
