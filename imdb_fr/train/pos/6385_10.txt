This movie was great! It was an excellent interpretation of an ancient myth. The animation was a bit strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was certainly better than expected for a Disney movie without singing. <br /> <br /> The animation of the background was magical. It was a different level of work for Disney people. Some characters were a little boxy, but the beauty and the sumptuousness of the decor were more than compensated. The music was largely instrumental but it was perfect for the movie. It was definitely not a film that required the characters to enter the song. <br /> <br /> Perfect. 10 of 10.
