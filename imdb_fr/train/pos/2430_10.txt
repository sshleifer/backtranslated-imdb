It's a short film by Casper the Friendly Ghost since my childhood and I'm watching it again on YouTube (Thanks to God for You Tube); after that, I love this short film and it's one of my favorite Casper shorts. <br /> <br /> I love how he starts frightening the haunted story of Frank Gallop; until we saw Casper sitting in the cemetery, sitting near his tombstone, reading. While each ghost has come out of the graves to "boo" people, Casper decides to go in search of a friend. But to try to make a friend, anyone who sees Casper runs away. Poor Casper sat on a log and cried; until a little fox gets up and hits him. Casper and the little fox bind quickly and he quickly names little Ferdie and considers him his best friend. <br /> <br /> The relations between Casper and Ferdie are seriously compromised. However, when Casper does not watch Ferdie closely while playing a game of hide and seek. While Ferdie hides a hunter and two of his hounds come to try to kill little Ferdie, he runs as fast as possible until he is out of breath and begins to gasp. As the fighter fires towards Ferdie, Casper notices that he tries to kill him, flies in the direction of the hunter and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And the hunter and the dogs are terrified by Casper. Casper shouts to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and all is well. But Casper sees that Ferdie's body does not move and asks if he's fine. When Casper notices Ferdie's death, he begins to cry in pain because he has lost "the only friend of his life". Casper returns to the cemetery where he buried Ferdie and made a gravestone for him next to Casper's gravestone. Casper continues to cry until he sees that Ferdie is resurrected himself as a ghost. Ferdie begins to lick Casper on his cheek. Casper screams with joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good short film; surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon.
