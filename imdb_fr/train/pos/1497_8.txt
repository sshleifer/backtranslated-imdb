This film is an entertaining horror horror film (inspired by Tales from the Crypt), written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It's very fun for horror fans and its distribution is excellent. The film should also be watched by Doctor Who fans as Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has a funny role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!
