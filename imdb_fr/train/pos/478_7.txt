I am rather surprised that no criticism so far has commented on the rather basic gaffe in the game of Luzhin in white against an anonymous opponent before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as an expert consultant in chess, it is shown that Luzhin wins the match with an illegal shot. Between the quick cuts and the return to the board, it is not difficult to notice that after the combination of Luzhin leading to a queen sacrifice, his tower in d1 is still pinned by the black tower in C1 against his king in the corner in H1. Thus, he is unable to play the so-called Rd1-d8 mating movement that would be illegal - but he showed it to enthusiastic applause from the public.
