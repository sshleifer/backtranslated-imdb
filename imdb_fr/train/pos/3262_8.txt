I do not think I could have appreciated it more, even if some things were disturbing. I will not say what, if you have not seen it ... you will have to discover it yourself. Anyway, what movie can miss with Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy eyes? Overall, the plot has been sufficiently developed. Nothing seemed too hurried, as movies like this one tend to be. The characters were capable, and there were many hilarious scenes. The general idea is that history is very well linked, although some aspects may be unsatisfactory ... as an opinion. But as I said before, it's hard not to like a movie with Robert Downey Jr.
