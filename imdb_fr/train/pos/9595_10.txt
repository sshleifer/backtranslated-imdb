At the beginning of this film, one of the commentators said that he had been told that he had two strikes against him: he is black and a man. But on top of that, he has a third strike: he is gay. "You'll have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he told him. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about homosexual, transvestite or transsexual black men and Hispanic men. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that the director Jennie Livingston takes a subject that could very easily have become a monster show and allows the people who live there their humanity. We learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so inaccessible that it's tragic. Many people seriously deny; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are clich√©s in this film of naked transsexuals. If you have a problem of homosexuality, then this film does not suit you. But if you see this film, you will realize that "Paris is Burning" does not really mean men dressed in women's clothing, but a group of people who are regularly marginalized and belittled by society in general, and of what they do to get a sense of belonging to a community in their life. <br /> <br /> I've watched this film four times since it was released in 1991, because it says a lot: it's a commentary on materialism in our culture, on gender roles, on the rich and the poor, on the media and what they celebrate, on glory and adulation. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most human and sad films I have ever seen.
