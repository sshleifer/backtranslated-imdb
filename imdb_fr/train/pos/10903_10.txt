This man is not surprising. You really feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry with his family in the end. He was so passionate about his cause, not just for himself, but to ensure that others who survive him do not suffer this miserable pain. I watch this video every time I have a bad day, and she always manages to make me see the biggest and brightest of life, just like Jonny, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is not to know Jonny sooner because I visited England twice during his life and I could have said that I had met him. It's comforting to know that Jonny is sitting on his cloud, without pain! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
