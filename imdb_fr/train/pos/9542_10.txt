Do not be fooled by the idiots of the title, it's a great adventure! A true successor to Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this jewel begins with a bang and puts the gore on the skin right up to the credits. It seems that the extraterrestrials take people's bodies and turn them into war machines, which are then used to fight in a twisted game to entertain their species. The winner of the battle eats the living loser. This is especially for intrigue, but who cares to know when the blood is good? I have no idea how many buckets of mud are used, but it's disgusting to see it. There is an interesting and effective use of stopping movements when takeovers are underway and caring for all creature and make-up effects. The CGI is a bit limited, but that does not detract from the overall quality, at least for me. It was really a funny and disconcerting film that deserves a lot of praise and has really earned its place in the pile of Cult Classics. Find it and look, you will not be disappointed!
