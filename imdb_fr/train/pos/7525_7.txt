Bettie Page was an icon of the repressed 1950s, when she represented the sexual freedom that was still waiting for a decade, but aroused the hopes and dreams of many adolescents and young adults. Gretchen Mol does a superb job portraying the outrageous Bettie, an urban girl with acting ambitions and a great body. Her career as an actress has come to nothing, but her body has brought her to the top of the glory in a field certainly marginal. Shown in black and white with color interludes when it comes out of the world of exploitation in New York, this film for television (HBO) has good production values ​​and a very credible distribution. The problem is that it's emotionally rather flat. It is difficult to create a link with the character, because Bettie is portrayed as a person rather superficial and naive given his business. Selfish government investigations are given a lot of time on the screen, which slows the film towards the end. But it is really worth looking at the history of this era and seeing the heavy government repression that characterized the 1950s. 7/10
