It's an excellent movie. This concerns many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the drive of a man and the relationship between this man (the main detective) and his superior. <br /> <br /> What is close to my heart is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (excuse me for the spelling, please!). For some reason, it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turn into respect and cameraderie and work together. A sentence from the film sums it up for me: "He would say something witty, but he is overwhelmed by emotions." . <br /> <br /> This is not a fast action thriller; In fact, it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfying and does not constitute an exploitation of the crimes. <br /> <br />
