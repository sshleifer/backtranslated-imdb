I do not know why some people criticize this show so much. <br /> <br /> It's a great fun show - it may not be the right material for the general public, but still ... <br /> <br /> The family dynamic is fun , and overall, we see the same thing in most humorous shows. The secondary characters are absolutely hilarious. The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent jibes of Siegfried & Roy are only slightly above average, but you often have subplots or one-liners that make you roll on the ground. The show was well worth the 8 pounds I paid for it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
