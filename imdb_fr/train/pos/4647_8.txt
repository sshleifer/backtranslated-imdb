Making a film as miserable, seductive, disgusting and repulsive takes on a very particular kind of person, but in a way that makes it so brilliant and the epitome of personal cinematographic liberation. Crispin Glover, in all his antics and "out of the ordinary" predispositions, has truly created something unique. In a world that has become extremely partisan, this film seems to escape the classic lines of creativity and art and to effectively surprise everyone. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, the film adopts a rather distant paradigm (if there really is a model) and initially shapes it with Shirley Temple tastes in front of a swastika and naked women giving pleasure. a man with cerebral palsy. It's rather shocking, but if you had the opportunity to participate in the Q & A after the screenings, it would clearly open a bag of worms that would let you ask if it was an art or a lowest common denominator. In either case, you feel the quake that this movie will eventually cause. This will never be accepted, not even by the supposed writers of the world who speak with boredom of the human condition. You may not like it, but it's certainly something to watch.
