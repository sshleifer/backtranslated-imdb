Of all the football movies I've watched, it's one of the 2 best ones. The other being the tone of the fever. But Hero is talking about the world's biggest cup ever and, therefore, the greatest player ever to have played in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is mainly focused on him, but also on the other giants of the game of the time. <br /> <br /> The score is evocative and the images are powerful. Michael Caine's narration is appropriately unbiased and discreetly dramatic. This story does not concern the individual games of the World Cup; it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting games like France v Brazil (one of the greatest of all time) were approached in the same spirit. The Argentine final against Germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to watch again and again, especially if you are a fan of Maradona.
