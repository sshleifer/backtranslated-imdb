<br /> <br /> In an artistic way, the actors describe exactly their role. You really feel like Lucienne is going from poverty to the most beautiful girl in the area. A sense of tragedy to triumph again tragedy. In total, I saw this film at least 10 times. And I can VERY well say that the Prix De Beute '(the price of beauty, Miss Europe) is one of the great favorites of my silent film collection. Louise Brooks' expressiveness is perfect and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates the artistic beauty associated with a tragic story.
