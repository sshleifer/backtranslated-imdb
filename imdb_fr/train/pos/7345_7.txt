Picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks, of course, got what I paid for! I could not care about the hot girls, but the animation completely upset me after a balanced diet of Simpsons (sorry, Mr. Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend multiple views with cool tunes, good friends and a couple of cold!
