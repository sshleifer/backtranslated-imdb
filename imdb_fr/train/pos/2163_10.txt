I just like this movie. This is a perfect example of the amazing and complete stories of Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the just awful Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully interpreted. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was dismayed when I first saw the trailer for the redone US version. At worst, it's the Hollywood Hollywood commercialism. The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The ONLY reason why the original movie was not seen more widely is the American public's aversion to subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons this film would never work in an American screenplay is that the film is reserved, extremely social and conservative. The Japanese character is involved in this film. Certainly, the main character understands better how to lead a living life through dance, but half the tension of the film comes from the stereotypes and ridicule faced by the ballroom dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Try to see this movie. in its original form, not the terrible full screen. And, please, avoid the American remake .... it's a superficial parody compared to the original Japanese movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the film "original" is much older and it is simply a Japanese film. Take the story, but the only two people likely to see it anytime soon are this one and the new American remake. <br /> <br /> Regarding foreign films, I will make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I list this first for a reason, an exceptional movie! 2.Johnny Stechino-very funny mistaken identity Italian cop! 3.Shiri-A Korean action photo that mixes both an Asian touch and an American-style plot 4.Run Lola Run - A German film ingeniously integrating its techno score. <br /> <br /> Well, just a quick list anyway: -)
