I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I have not seen it yet, but I'm afraid anyone pays to see me drunk. Especially considering what we did this year. The problem is that they probably edited it too much. Especially the scene where my roommate was sniffing the tits coca of a Mexican prostitute (they probably should have followed him everywhere). We made a few comings and goings but other than that, I do not really remember anything. I was the MC in a few scenes (from what I was told.What I can tell you is that everyone has avoided the film crew, because who wants that we remember him as the guy who vomited or the girl who showed her breasts to the whole world (or the girl the loser lost her virginity to.) Overall, the trip itself was crazy, but people act differently once the camera is on them.
