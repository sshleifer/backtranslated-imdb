Having seen only two of his images previously, I agreed with Altman. Previously, however, I have always described his movie style as boring. You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius. <br /> <br /> "Health" is quite underrated and very questionable. In fact, I do not think it has ever been attributed to VHS. Why is that? When all these crappy movies come out every day on DVD, this one is left for nothing? Honestly, I had no real problem with this movie. For the most part, it was always fun and fun. Almost all scenes are mysteriously interesting for whatever reason, be it wonderful dialogue or subtle representations. There are real skills here. <br /> <br /> And the passage of Paul Dooley at the bottom of the pool at the halfway point is fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this little gem forgetfulness. It's not perfect, but it's way better than most sludge available for DVD release. Damn, I'll be happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> This often happens on the Fox Movie channel, so watch it.
