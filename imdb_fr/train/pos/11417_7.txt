This film seemed to me to be a project that contained a lot of the right ingredients, but somewhere in the process they did not really combine. I do not know who did it, but it's a little Disney-esque. Although some parts are unlikely (such as when a pre-adolescent is coming to a public office) and tend to prevent the story being taken seriously, there is a good deal of normalcy (whatever it is) to maintain things in balance and in perspective. The game is good. Strangely, the relationship between Frankie and his grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a little ... off. It's interesting to see that she has to work hard to maintain a balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player myself, it was pretty painful to see Frankie trying to get along with a boys' team, but that shows the fight she is facing. I read somewhere that she was not really a ballerina, but the editing of this film was very successful in giving her a not only natural, but beautiful dance appearance. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star, Mischa Barton, did not reach the level of realism seen in his performances in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious", and his shocking little performance in front. Haley Joel Osment in "The 6th Sense".
