As in most of Eleanor Powell's films, this one takes place in the most fragile scenario. For some reason - oh that's explained! - She was chosen to transport a magnetic mine in Cuba. The good guys and the bad guys are competing for the mine and they are confused. But, as always, Powell's dance is superb and worth the price of admission. And in this one, Lahr plays with his cowardly lion, evoking the warm memories of this 1939 Technicolor movie. An added bonus is hearing a young Frank, with that wonderful voice and meager vulnerability he has abandoned for his character of wise. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time showing his virtuosity. Look especially at his unique duet with Dorsey trumpet player, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique" perhaps out of ignorance, but I do not know any other drum / trumpet sequences like this on film or on disc. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's wacky character is relatively sober. Powell shows again that she is the greatest movie dancer of all time.
