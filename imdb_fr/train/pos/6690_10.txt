Mystery Men is one of those movies that grows with time. There is a naive innocence and a "kindness" to the characters. It's now part of our family "culture" and we often quote the characters. It's my favorite movie of the last two years. My children are 13 and 11 years old and we all love this movie. Super actor and comedy. We also love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python movies. Okay, we're not talking about intellectuals here, just family links!
