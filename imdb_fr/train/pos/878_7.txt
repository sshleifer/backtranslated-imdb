Interesting characters, a lot of tension. As close to black and white without being black and white. I was shocked by the casualness of the supposedly sympathetic main character, a silent, almost deaf secretary who was able to turn to crime to ruin his colleagues, shake people up in his own way and finally participate in a robbery and set up someone one to be screwed up like a lure to his own escape. I am a little shocked by the tendency of otherwise quality films to portray criminals with sympathy without addressing the harm they have caused to others than to portray their immediate opponents as fools. In this film, we never know who the money is, but that's what happens to the innocent wife that the friendly deaf secretary uses to set up the owner of the bar sordid to bring down the missing booty. Too bad, the movie could have been great.
