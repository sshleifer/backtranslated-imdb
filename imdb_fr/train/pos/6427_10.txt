If you're in the mood to have fun ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started pretty well ... but it's Govinda stealing the show ... awesome timing and good presentation of the dialogue ... it's inspired by Bad Boys ... but there's Indian Masala. .. people think it might be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan directs and Govinda plays the role ... should not ask questions .... other recommended movies in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo)) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero # 1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
