It's a generally good movie, with a good story, great actors and songs. The cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weak points of the film is the annoying chain of copied sequences of Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt to try an originality, Abbas? Mustan? Someone? <br /> <br /> The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya can not conceive after an accident that she had during her previous pregnancy and they finally decided to call on a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. They choose Madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I mean, is not it easier to adopt? And even if they choose a girl, does that mean that the man has to sleep with her? Have you heard of insemination? Anyway, I guess if the writers had heard of all this, the film would not have been shot. The concept is therefore apparently intentional. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's good to see him play a serious character. But his character suffers from useless and inexpensive dialogues about his great love for his wife and how difficult it is to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's corny and unrealistic. Rani is pretty much OK; she is generally efficient and tries to do something with the role but is completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show with her flawless performance. She goes easily from noisy prostitution to the sensitive woman. She lives the film, emotes and makes you love and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of his best performances in career. No doubt she is more talented than her contemporaries in the industry. She should just do more of those roles. <br /> <br /> The end of the film only highlights what I said above. It's heartbreaking, exciting and very well played. Look at it for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
