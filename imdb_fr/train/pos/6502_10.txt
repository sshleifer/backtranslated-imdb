Although I was too young to remember the first broadcast of the series (being just a baby), I saw her on TV in the late 80s, just as I was interested in the war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather who showed me the series for the first time, as well as my first interests, telling stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have devoured many books and seen many television series about the Second World War, with mixed opinions. British TV channels are generally very good at producing them, as The World At War shows, with many gems made by both the BBC and independent companies. I highly recommend titles such as "The Nazis - A Warning of History", "Blitz" and the BBC series on Dunkirk. "Britain At War In Color", with its companion series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are of a very high standard. The world at war is by far the best and, in spite of its age, it never fails. There will always be new revelations about the war that will continue to emerge and that are obviously not part of the series. Of course, the Second World War took place on such a vast canvas that the production of a series with ALL the details would take more time and money. then any other, even if such a commitment was even possible. What I feel I have to say to those who complain that not everything is included is that The World At War can not physically do it as a series, but it certainly can do further research and make it enjoyable. It certainly worked for me: I now have a very complete library of books, videos, DVDs, tapes and CDs. Recommend to anyone with even a passing interest. The series was so well done that they would have a hard time not recognizing that it is a quality programming and very informative.
