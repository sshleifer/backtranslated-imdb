The thing I remember most about this film is that it was broadcast on local KTLA television (Ch 5) every Christmas season, from the mid to late 1970s, mainly because the real story was taking place on or around Christmas Eve. . It was always a bit disturbing to see the hell this girl was going through, the only survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this girl pulling leeches from her infected leg made a strong impression on this young spectator. Not quite the kind of Christmas joy that I used to see at the time. This is certainly not a Rankin-Bass production.
