I really liked this movie because I have a husband like the guy in this movie. This film tells the story of Lindsey who meets Ben in winter, while the baseball season is not at the rendezvous. She falls in love but when spring comes, she has the shock of her life when she is lower down on her pedestal set. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with all the baseball obsession that Ben has. He can not separate from what he likes most, that's what makes him so funny and why so many women can fit Lindsey into real life. Moreover, the people with whom he sits at baseball games are just as obsessed as he is. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie and you will not be caught off guard if you rent this one.
