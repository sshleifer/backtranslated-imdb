I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba does a great job in this area. Michael Weatherly is also doing a fantastic job, as well as the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing and they have wonderful stories and their stunts are incredible. It's like watching a one-hour movie. It is definitely worth watching.
