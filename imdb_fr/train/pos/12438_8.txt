The film was a highly anticipated release, which was a little disappointing because of the expectations I had put in place. When we look at it again, I have to say that it's actually pretty good. First of all, it's very faithful to the original story (of course, not quite) and is only as such made to retain the right to the film. The story of modesty as a child is shown and is very faithful to the original. The acting is perhaps not the best and the plot is a little thin, but when you compare it to the 1966 film, Vitti is much better simply because it's not is not a musical comedy. In general, I would recommend it only to fans of Modesty Blaise or someone who understands it on TV.
