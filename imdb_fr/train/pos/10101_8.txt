The Dominion Tank Police is a contradictory exercise. The narrative through the 4 parts combines stupid action, humor "slap-stick", touching humanity and questions of philosophical reflection. It's hard to believe that there was only one director, because the style changes from episode to episode. A must-see movie for anyone who loves anime.
