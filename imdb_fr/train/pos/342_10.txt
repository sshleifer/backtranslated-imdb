I gave him an 8 only because he had received so low votes ... it's really really a 5.5 ..... Ummm .. it was a bit bloody, with nice and superficial characters and there were really hot babes in it. I like the eclectic killer, because he did not kill people the same way every time ... who gets old sometimes.
