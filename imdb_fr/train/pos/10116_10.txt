An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern takes the trouble to research and document his writings and it is worth it. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even though it may elicit criticism and negative comment from some who like stories to be pure and brilliant. <br /> <br /> as important as he played in Hillsborough. I found this film as accurate, well played and presented as Hillsborough and I commend McGovern for his poignant and shameless writing. Bravo and I lift my hat to the writer, the actors and the production team. A great movie!
