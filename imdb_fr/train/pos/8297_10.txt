A class movie shot in 2 directions. To his advantage, he is led by Wes Craven. On the downside, the budget of the televised film shows what could have been much more with a larger budget. Susan Lucci draws the attention of the Robert Urich family and tries to persuade him to discover the secret of his health club. His latest invention, a space suit capable of analyzing people or objects, becomes of unexpected utility in his new neighborhood. Anyone who sees this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Its appearance and performance had unexpected repercussions a few years later. The actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and has written a review of this film. Lucci became the subject of a portrait of him followed as a basis for the work of a sitter named Catherine. The portrait of Lucci and Barbara Steele in 'Black Sunday' was used as a reference for Catherine's portraits immediately removed by Armourae. Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine. So, seeing both films, we can get a glimpse of another story and the appearance of an unknown woman who would make an interesting movie.
