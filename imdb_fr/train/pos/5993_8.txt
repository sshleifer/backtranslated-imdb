The Cure uses voice over to create an intense atmosphere. Although the VO represents all the lines of the film, it does not remove anything from the visual story. The use of several movie films adds a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining black and white and color worked well to improve jumps over time. The end will make you jump despite the ability to anticipate the result. I especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense. The close-ups of the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. Tight editing really helps to show what a short film can do. It's worth it to watch more than once!
