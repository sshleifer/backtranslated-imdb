While many have unfortunately passed away, the ballroom scene is still very much alive and perpetuates their legacy. Some are still very alive and well, Octavia is brighter and more beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very accomplished and brings a lot of support to the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeija just forwarded last year a natural cause, May she rest in peace. After Anji's death, Carmen became the mother of Xtravaganza's house (she was in the beach scene) and she is getting prettier. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed, that they all rest in peace. There is currently another project underway called "How can I watch?", You can visit the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
