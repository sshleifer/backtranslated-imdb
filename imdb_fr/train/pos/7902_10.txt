The film is exceptional in its gay iconography and extends beyond aesthetics, music and distribution. Throughout the film, a child wonder is seen through the eyes of the main character. His light look at the world around us is comical and beautiful. In a way, it's a slacker movie for girls. Look, you want an entertaining and entertaining movie in the middle of the night. Buy it if you like different styles and love combined (?).
