I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any other movie I've seen in years. A successful band from the 70's decided to try their luck. They start playing a few shows in shabby European theaters, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the script and the acting are fantastic. The characters are at the top, especially the lead singer with his heavy heavy voice, his makeup and his personality issues. The concert at the end was unreal. Go see it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :)
