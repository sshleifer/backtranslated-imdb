It's a movie that contains a lot of things that only the Japanese can understand. Even translated, there are things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. I guess the group tried to send a message, but it just spoiled me. <br /> <br /> What I felt was essentially a mediocre film with pretty special effects. A kid becomes "The One" and in the end has almost nothing to do with a yokai war that makes no sense. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean washing the yokai and the one that looks like a big umbrella with tongues (Rihanna eats your heart!), I could not really discern the plot. Final result: beautiful visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terribly cute and the rest is shit.
