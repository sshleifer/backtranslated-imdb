I'm totally shocked that this show was canceled.The show only lasted a year.I just recently started watching it and I love it.It's a show that could have gone as far as Friends . He had humor and was extremely nice. <br /> <br /> These are 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under the same roof without their parents.Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the role of the older brother and assumes the most paternal role. <br /> <br /> It should last a lot longer than the year because it was fantastic. Amazing show with all the best actors. <br /> <br /> 10/10
