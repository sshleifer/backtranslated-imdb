I saw the recent DVD of Region 2 of this movie shown in the "horror" section of an Oxford Street store and touted as a "classic thriller". In fact, it is almost solely Arthur Askey's vehicle, one of the most popular names in British comedy and entertainment for over forty years. as a culture shock for many people accustomed to the sour and cynical flavor of most British comedies of the last twenty-five years. However, there are always those who appreciate his lively and cheerful personality and his total avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who frequently borrowed the "self-strangling" gag with which Arthur tries to entertain stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> Linden, underrated, makes a rare appearance. Travers, making an impact like the mysterious Julie.
