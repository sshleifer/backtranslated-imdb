I grew up watching Full House as a child. I stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago I started watching it again. Now my kids are watching the show and they love watching it too. My kids can not believe DJ, in the show, and I are the same age. <br /> <br /> I really like the series because it's a series that you can watch with your family. He has good teachings that your children can learn. Moreover, there is no drugs and violence on this subject. In addition, when the children in the series have a problem, they can always ask for help from their family. This is the message children should receive from television in a few days: ask your family for help, not drugs. Kids should watch more shows like Full House instead of half of the mess on TV now. <br /> <br /> I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it's down to earth. He talks about real-life issues and family issues. There is always a lesson to be learned from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote the show at 10.
