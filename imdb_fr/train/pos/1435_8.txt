I like movies like this: smart and well-designed, entertaining, absorbing, well-played and well-directed. Nobody - not even Pacino - chews the landscape *, trying to stand out; One of the most effective moments of the film (Aielo stops on his favorite release) is scary precisely because of his restraint. <br /> <br /> Not as good as QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar fabric: engaging the mind as well as the eyes, ears and heart. One suspects why one wonders if the box office entertainment is so well done. <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino chews it in a particular scene, but precisely because it's necessary. Great scene too.
