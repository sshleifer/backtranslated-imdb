I saw the last five or ten minutes of this film in 1998 or 1999, an evening when I was surfing on a TV channel before going to bed, and I really liked what I saw. Since then, I've been on the lookout, browsing TV channels, flipping through DVD / VHS players in stores, but I have not found any copies until recently, when I discovered that some Internet stores were selling it. Then, as a world-class procrastinator, I still had not ordered it. Finally, I found a copy of DVDs in a Circuit City during a visit to Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then it only took me about a month after I got home before sitting down and watching the movie. <br /> <br /> So, what do I think of the film? Its good. Not as good as I remembered and hoped for, but still worth the $ 9.99 it cost me. After seeing the entire movie for the first time, I rate it as a 7/10, with the potential to become an 8/10. I will have to sleep less and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to attract dialogue.
