Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a wonderful film as a whole. The mix of types of animation is unique, the scenario is amazing and the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The animation is a characteristic of many animations. The way they expressed the characters, especially the horses, through their animation is particularly spectacular. Although the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who have not studied horses may not understand. Without words, I imagine it would be difficult to express them through the features. Because of this, I understand the "eyebrow" that they have added to horses (while real horses do not have those thick lines). One of the few things I noticed about horse habits that could have been described strangely is that the Spirit is leading the flock of his mother. In herds of wild horses, the main stallion usually hunts young foals. <br /> <br /> In addition, although some people may think that representing White Army officers as a "bad guy" is stereotyped, think of all the films in which Native Americans were portrayed like that. Sometimes at the time they treated the mustangs very badly. For example, in actual history, the Appaloosa race was almost eliminated because of army officers. Imagine what would have happened to one of the world's most loved riders if the Native Americans had not saved them. <br /> <br /> I find it amazing that realism has not been removed by forcing the horses to talk to each other. . Spirit's feelings were expressed by a little narration, but mainly by music (by Bryan Adams). The songs express the story very well and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams told the story very well through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The emotion I felt watching the movie, whether it was the first time or the twentieth (yes, I watched a lot), you would not believe. Some scenes take your breath away, while others make you cry with tears in your eyes. The opening sequence, which shows Spirit's homeland, immediately puts you in spectacular action. <br /> <br /> I do not understand at all why some people are so hateful for this brilliant movie. Overall, I rate it 10/10 - to see absolutely.
