Well, I must say that I waited for it to come. <br /> <br /> I will not try to mess it up and many people have really talked brilliantly about the pilot. On the other hand, I am not sure to understand the detractors who say they are fans of BSG and who do not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What were they expecting ?! The context goes down 50 years before BSG, we witness the birth of the Cylons, discover the life of the Adama family (we have already heard about it at BSG), get a more detailed explanation of the caprican population and its perception of other colonies, and potentially the origins of God's belief in man and God's unique belief in the Cylons. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same profusion of special effects or space operas as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two, although I know that Caprica will strengthen BSG. <br /> <br /> It's a promising start time of 1:30, I also think it's going to push for the scenarios to be as good as BSG. I expect a lot from the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we would learn much more. <br /> <br /> Watching the scene removed from the DVD also gives more material to your brain. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, January 2010
