Bad casting, dreadful holey scenario, hot blonde eaten alive, The bad scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, a man attacks a trained firing squad and comes out victorious, terrible special effects, they solve the problem by blowing to head out of the monster ... awesome. The only thing missing was a useless graphic sex scene during one of the murders. Haha. Good fun gored up filled with predictable twists and a ludicrous lining. I really enjoyed this movie, but before you watch it, make sure to laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie without taking it seriously. I can not, in my mind, think that this film was designed for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch the movie, sit back and enjoy it, I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be appreciated. Very simply. So grab some popcorn and a few beers and have a fun night out with friends and this movie. It brought joy in my life.
