Men of Honor has many interesting aspects. Good action sequences, many scenes of "feeling good", a good musical score, but the part that really makes the film is the acting game. Mainly by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor is centered on Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to become the first African-American deep-sea diver in the navy. He tells of his tough battle as a poor farmer to enter a diving school and even further. It's a good story, but it seems like it's been done many times before. One person, against all odds, will not give up until they have achieved the goals they set for a sentimental reason many years ago. This could happen, but many of the struggles facing Brashear in the film are debatable, including the C.O. of the diving school altering his final test. However, all this is done for the stage when Robert Deniro finally enters the film. Deniro plays the Mater Leader Sunday who is the teacher of the diving school that Brashear attends. As soon as Deniro arrives, he omits that atmosphere of extreme arrogance that you can not hate unless you have incredible power. Before the end of the film, Deniro gives several speeches that will make you laugh how cool he is, but you are too stunned by the way he hits them. At the end, you have to doubt certain aspects of the film, but admit it, if it were absolutely true, it would require you to suspend it for the first twenty minutes.
