It's an excellent, heartbreaking film. This is by far the best I've seen depicting the current reality in Latin America: kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and heartless rascality towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives, in my opinion, the most moving performance of his career. Dakota Fanning is an extraordinary young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and described, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are brilliant, as always. Walken illuminates the screen for me like no other actor. I would have liked to see more of them both. The authentic places are remarkable. The work of the camera is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, which makes the film all the more interesting for the regulars of Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
