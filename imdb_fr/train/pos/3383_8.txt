Especially at a time when science fiction was little filmed (1973), this is a fantastic vision of a future where everything goes wrong. Too many people and nothing works. The only people who can live comfortably are the rich. This is happening in New York in 2022 (I think), and it reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> I must enjoy Charlton Heston's game after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (perhaps) able to portray a range of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here, he is torn between a slightly corrupt policeman (who takes rare treats from the rich) and a total corruption (actively endorse the evil). <br /> <br /> The film seems to take place at night and everyone is sweating, except in one of the few air-conditioned apartments. Even if I had not seen it before, I knew the famous ending (which will not be revealed here), but the end is certainly announced. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenes with Edward G. Robinson: go to the council (composed of elderly Jews with heavy accents, it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then, go see the Thanatopsis. <br /> <br /> Crystalline dystopian science fiction before the Star Wars.
