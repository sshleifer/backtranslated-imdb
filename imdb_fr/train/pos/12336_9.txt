An excellent melodrama of period murder, where Fontaine plays effectively against his naive type to the wallflower, in a role that would have been refused by Olivia DeHavilland. That's good, because Fontaine is beautiful. Scripted by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the 1930s and who later also wrote the excellent screenplay for the classic British horror movie Night of the Demon. The opening scene, where Ivy visits a grim fortune-teller played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (the star of James Whale's fame), is a stunt and the film continues its interest throughout many dark machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD one day, but I'm desperate to see it happen, because it seems like an unduly obscure movie. Fortunately, I saw it on AMC seven or eight years ago, but I have not seen it since. Catch him if you can!
