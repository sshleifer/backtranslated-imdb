and what a combo. Two of the great singers of the century play together in this underrated musical. He writes music, writes lyrics and they both work for Basil Rathbone, who can not write either because his wife is dead (in fact, she just got fat!). The best scene is the pawn shop number where Bing sings an impromptu number while the swing group pulls out its hock instruments. Just wonderful. And that's a rare role in Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and she's very good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (again the manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram, co-starring. And who knew that Rathbone could be funny?
