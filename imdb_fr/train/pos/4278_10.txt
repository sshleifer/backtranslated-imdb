This is the movie I have seen more than any other movie (I think I've seen it on average once a year since it was released). And every time I see him, he is also fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The cast was most likely a combination of the best of the ex-Yu cinematography. This film is a must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. It's a movie poker that everyone should have in their collection of private videos.
