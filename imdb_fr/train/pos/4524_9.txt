This is a very rare example of a movie about cross-dressing (heterosexuals). The film deals with the taboo theme so that even a general public who does not know anything about disguise sympathizes with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible as Gerald / Geraldine and should not be forgotten for this brilliant game. The staging of Christopher Monger is very delicate, it deals in an excellent way with such a difficult problem, in a beautiful story. Not a great movie, or a film "art", but a little beautiful movie!
