I liked the way the Earth is made. His photography is amazing, the editing had to be an interesting challenge and the voice of Patrick Stewart is PERFECT. In addition, his music and editing make EARTH an experience not to be missed. You are really in a journey where you will probably never find yourself alone. <br /> <br /> And although, at first, I was quite surprised by the laughter of the public as we see animals in their daily struggle for survival, I could not help but laugh at myself -even sometimes. Nature just seems too impressive to be understood. <br /> <br /> But, rather than laughing, I left the cinema with a deep question: "How 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy the natural systems that have been there for thousands and thousands of years ? <br /> <br /> With this question in mind, you will understand how bitter and helpless I felt after seeing EARTH. I immediately felt the need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have undergone in recent centuries and to put an immediate end to global warming (all that, not to be an NGO activist!) ... <br /> <br /> So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our fantastic planet (and the bear polar) of his depressing destiny. . (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a little disappointed not to find direct answers to my questions. However, it was very interesting to know more about the film and the difficulties of his team. <br /> <br /> I hope that reducing my energy consumption will suffice. I do not know how to shorten the distance of the polar bears to reach the mainland before drowning or attacking animals that they can not beat in their state of fatigue ... <br /> <br /> C ' is an inspiring film, but I did not leave the cinema very happy.
