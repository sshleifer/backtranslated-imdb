It's simple and it's better to make a movie. <br /> <br /> I had doubts, because even though Freeman is an excellent actor, he is sometimes involved in bad projects. It's not one of those moments. <br /> <br /> This is a little story that lasts a little over an hour and a quarter, at a time when we get used to the fact that the movies are getting longer and not necessarily better, director uses the short time to his advantage, because the characters are so well defined from the beginning (great interpretations of freeman and Vega by the way), that the little background information on them seems real Morgan is himself, although his name is not mentioned, he's been out of the movie business for two years now, because he was saturated with the business, and was afraid to engage in a screenplay and he's looking of a character in an independent film where he plays a role. store manager / supermarket. The story begins with his fall in a supermarket in a difficult neighborhood, where he meets the cashier of 10 items or less (Vega) and has to do a tour with her because "the production" has forgotten to take it. <br /> <br /> In many ways it's a road movie, Morgan provides the laughs and quirks with his unbeatable smile and positive outlook on everything, showing an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to be able to define all those he sees in a character he could play, and Paz (by the way, what an extraordinary woman, even more magnificent than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a separated woman aged 25 who works more than anything the world without having any credit in case of death End of the job in a crappy supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's a walkie-talkie, there's a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and pleasure, and the serious and sad is well supported, the characters become so adorable all immediately spend the last 20 minutes begging for more time on the screen This is a strange couple, but the brevity is in the nature of the story, so it was a good call from the director not to give in.
