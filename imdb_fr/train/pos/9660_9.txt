It was only after reflection that I decided to love this film. And having read the comments of all the other posters here and thought about it a little more, I decided that I liked it a lot. I love American movies, probably because they are very narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle and end. "Almost nothing", on the other hand, does not attempt such an attempt. I do not agree with other posters that say it's "too artistic". In all respects, this film is designed to evoke your sensory memories. So often, throughout the film, it feels like being there ... we feel the summer sun, the breeze, the heat, the winter cold, the camaraderie, the loneliness, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> In all respects, the director takes you into the characters' lives - that's why so many people feel so impressed that the film has disappointed them. After I finished watching, I felt the same. But after reflection, I understood that the film should be like this: the story is not the story, it is the emotions that you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting, the landscapes, and the camera angles plunge you into the scenes - they are rich, exquisite and full of details and nuances. Although I normally can not accept movies without a complete plot (after all, it's not a "supposed to" tell a story), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
