Of all the films of the seventies, none captured the true essence of the battle of good against evil as the Sentinel did. I mean, yes, there were movies like The Exorcist, and others; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, check this one. You may not be able to go beyond obsolete devices as such, but this is a story that deserves to be explained. Then there are all the stars and stars to come. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what is happening as well. To pay particular attention to. I had to look four times to understand all the strange little statements like "black and white cat, black and white cake". Plus, the books are really good too. I'm just sorry they will not turn the second book into a movie. It's so scary that it would go beyond this movie.
