Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he largely compensates for it with his extravagant and wider interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> This is particularly effective when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the film. As Scott stands in front of a large window, the sunlight covers him with a glowing mantle. all you can see is his silhouette. Raised by Scott's voice, a heavy growl, the effect is galvanizing ... a bit like the first scene of Marlon Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW. "Horror", indeed! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, what works for you can also work against you. Because Scott is so ferocious throughout the film, it's infectious. In other words, Scrooge "before" is almost as charismatic as "after", although it really should not be. This is what we could call the "Dr. Smith" effect, since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach to play this role and many other titles (stage and screen). <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not do it myself. consider Scott's anger as a responsibility. But other purists "Christmas Carol" could. See the movie and judge for yourself.
