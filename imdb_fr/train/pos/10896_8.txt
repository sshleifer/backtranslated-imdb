At first, I did not think Ben Affleck could really make a funny Christmas movie. My boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to watch with her and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I loved Christina Appelagate and Catherine O 'Hara was good too, the script is what really sold me, I mean, also support the family, at the table for people you see barely. but once or twice a year, and you probably do not hear it anyway, you really need all the alcohol you can handle Christmas, so I thought the place was good there. the family, with $ 250000, was a bit far-fetched, but it turned out to be very good for me, because it was a riot from the beginning, it shows the class struggle of the different families. there are many fun moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenager. Overall, I loved this movie and will see it again next Christmas or earlier if my daughter wants it too.
