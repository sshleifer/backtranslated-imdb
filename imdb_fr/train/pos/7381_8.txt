IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are associated in a company alongside ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first ones have called on a professional killer, ANISIO, for the assassination of ESTEVÃO (the plot, at least in the beginning, do not explain why). The guy does it and after receiving his money, he begins to blackmail the two partners, to appear before them and to say that he wants a job there (as a supervisor or something like that?). At the same time, he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVÃO, and starts going out with her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, treason and blackmail go hand in hand, no one is innocent or a victim, except for MARINA, the only person not to do it. know what's going on and has not betrayed anyone ?? <br /> <br /> This film sarcastically depicts the sad and cruel reality that exists in a large metropolis like São Paulo, where crime is the daily presence. You can feel irony but also veracity in characters like ANISIO (brilliantly interpreted by Paulo Miklos), who blackmails people who have paid him without scruple and who even flirts with the girl of the guy he killed! He really has to be a monster to do something like that, but of course, I know there are people like him, in Brazil or elsewhere. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie, cruel but truthful, on a sad reality ?? The acting is great and the soundtrack too.
