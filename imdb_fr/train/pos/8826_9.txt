If you are amused by simple stories that are logical in a given illogical situation, you will enjoy this whimsical 8 minute Spanish movie. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems banal, but the man against, the customers and two musicians seem strangely mastered. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and a man begins to sing the title song by dancing on stage with a musical. gestures. The customers, at first motionless, read from time to time (badly but fancifully) phrases of the song, reading slips of paper in the palm of their hands. From time to time, they jump and dance (clumsily but seriously) in choreographed movements, in the manner of alternate singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman wonders. The answer is revealed when the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what is attached to her chest - just before the climax of the explosion ... <br /> <br /> Even if you do not understand not the lyrics (probably ironic) of the song, the ideal performances should give you a smile and a chuckle ... I'd love to see you again!
