To evaluate this film in a fair way, you have to think of the kind it is supposed to be: children. They had more instructions to follow to make this film (which means he could not afford some of the humor and / or language of the first movie). Taking all that was in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch. The suites usually make me nervous, but this one has done rather well. Knowing that Fraiser did not have the cool power of Fraiser since George capitalized on humor and I think Showeman performed very well as a leader. The plot is easy to follow and maybe sometimes camper fits well to a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope to be rewarded by an academy, that's not it, but if you want to watch a Simple, fun and energetic movie you would make a good choice with this one.
