The bottom line - best romantic comedy of all time. This film accomplishes what all great films seek: to create a world and an era that we want to revisit and make us happy to be part of the human race. When I'm blue, this film raises my spirit and makes me laugh (and it's always true after many views - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All actors are in top form. The characterizations are so dead and the characters bind so well that you forget the actor (usually hard to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The distribution is always brilliant: Fry ("agae", "a totally pygmy package"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists like "Greek choir" - "but time does not exist"), Durning ( "something we can cast from NJ"), Shalhoub & Whaley (boss and colleague of Robbins at the gas station) and Curits (Eisenhower - How many comedies have Eisenhower?). <br /> <br /> Don do not miss this forgotten treasure.
