Beware of spoilers. This film was fine. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the two best. Okay, so the foreign blunder guy who (SPOILER HERE) swapped with the biker for his clothes was funny. The boss of this guy was good too. But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn. These two should have spent more time on the screen together. They are chemistry was great. The scene of the bathroom-WOW! Romantic, nice, delicious. <br /> <br /> Hawn is an awkward cocktail waitress who rescues a foreign man and finds himself at the White House in the middle of a conspiracy because of the greed of the politicians. To speak of Sarandon would be to give a lot. SPOILERS This is a romantic / political comedy rather atypical, and it satisfies a little more both, the political side much more than the romantic. It addresses political issues and hardly avoids romantic areas. <br /> <br />
