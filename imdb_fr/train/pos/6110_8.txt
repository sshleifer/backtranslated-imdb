Like "My Sassy Girl", this film is based on a true story posted on the Internet, but that's where the similarities end. The story usually speaks of the rebel named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school and whose parents hire a guardian named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a poor woman, but gets to be the same age as him. Add to that some obstacles, the martial arts (the thugs always seek revenge after Ji-Hoon), a loving girl who makes fun of him and who is after him, his tendency to give up lessons, and you can usually guess the whole 'history. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This film has good fighting scenes, excellent visual humor and a lot of dynamism, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which brings a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work for this reason. And, I must say, I would like a girlfriend closer to Kim Ha Nuel than that of "My Sassy Girl" (at least in terms of personality). She has a bit of cum, but she is rather cute, sweet and warm. The characters are already quite nice (we could say that he had less hill to climb than "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that worked to his credit), and the film is rather intelligent and interesting most of the time. . The story deteriorates, however, to about two-thirds (where it walks on a standard and familiar rate, where nothing interesting happens), but towards the end, it picks up a bit. All in all, a fun and cute movie. 8/10
