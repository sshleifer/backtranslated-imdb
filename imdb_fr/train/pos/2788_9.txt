It's a so-called "wellness" film, but it made me sad in a way. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents did not let me study at the sports academy, I also decided to leave football at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> And football is the red line in this movie. Together with the struggle that young people have with parents' expectations. An Anglo-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and the English family with a girl who dresses like a boy and plays football ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also traces the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living your life (where did we ever hear before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful woman!) Play Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, makeup and stuff typical of 17-year-old girls. In contradiction with his sister Pinky, complete the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> It is really essential to see how a beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents and finds her chance. With good music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hit songs. <br /> <br /> Nice to watch, but if you, like me, have already played football and never went to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.
