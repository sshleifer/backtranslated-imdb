This shorter film is the embodiment of the expected results when the fool manages the asylum. It is sad to see how the future of these young people has been shattered if neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iraqi people, who rest the souls of the more than 350,000 people who were killed, had anything to do with the neither terrorism nor Al Quida. <br /> <br /> After this film, the astute viewer will have to buy or download a copy of "Loose Change". This movie is available for free on the Internet, until the Bush cabal locks it up, looking for the title itself in Google, as indicated in parentheses. <br /> <br /> God Save our country. This will not be done following the Christo-fascists who controlled the halls of Congress for more than 10 years before November 2006!
