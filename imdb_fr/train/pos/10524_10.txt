Jane Austen would certainly agree with this one! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a remarkable job capturing Emma's attitude. She is funny without being excessively silly, but elegant. She puts a very convincing British accent (not being British myself, I may not be the best judge, but she fooled me ... she was also excellent in "Sliding Doors" ... sometimes forget that she is American ~!). <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) are also brilliant as Bates women. They almost stole the show ... and Mrs. Law does not even have lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
