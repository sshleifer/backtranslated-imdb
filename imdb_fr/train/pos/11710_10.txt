Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins rock the world of the Christian subculture (and earn millions of dollars in class) with the books of LEFT BEHIND, MARK IV Pictures, the company's Christian film distribution company. evangelical association Billy Graham, has us masterpiece. What I like most about this is his incredible attention to detail, sitting in a living room. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "post-kidnapping" tribulation, we sit in the living room and hear about the news because filmmakers can not afford to show it. The premise of the film is based on a pre-millennial and pre-tribulation eschatalogy, in which he is convinced that Christ once comes for the secret taking of the true church, and then returns at the end of the seven years of hell on Earth. What terrified me in college now makes me laugh. Patty's intriguing adventures and journey through the tribulation (and two of the three sequels of the film) tell her remarkable story of unbelief and damnation. I hate to admit it, but I'm always happy to watch that. It even has the same exact note of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make this observation.
