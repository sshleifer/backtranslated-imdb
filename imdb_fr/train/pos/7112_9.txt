A very good war movie showing the effects of the war on a boy from his hometown who loses sight of Guadalcanal and must go home and readjust with the help of his family and friends. An excellent cast of actors contributes to make this film very entertaining. Eleanor Parker's role as a girlfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such innocence in this movie. Ann Doran's role was just as satisfying as all her minor roles. I particularly like the aura of hometown Phildelphia pre-war. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war scene at Guadalcanal really showed the horror experienced by our soldiers during this epic battle. A well deserved film that should not be forgotten
