I hardly remember this show a bit, but I remembered it was great! My older brother recently reminded me of the show and I saw an advertisement for the filming of the D.V.D. The network, once again screwed up by pulling it out of the air, to put what else in its place? It would have taken at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I sometimes think that network managers think they are the "gods" of the entertainment world. But they do not believe it and just miss good investments from time to time. Let's say, they have a lot more flops than 'hits'. This was one of the bad decisions to cut off the list. Anyway, I get this for my collection.
