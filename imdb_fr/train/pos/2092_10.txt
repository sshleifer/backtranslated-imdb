I watched this film with a certain curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved her Oscar. I left the film thinking YES! Having seen Muni in a single film where he was quite martial, I expected the same type of performance here. I was fortunately proved that I was wrong. Although some may criticize him as too childish and stereotypical-simple in the idea of ​​Asians in Hollywood, I thought he was perfectly right in the role. Keye Luke, if he had the chance to play a lead role, would probably have played it the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the work of the camera and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the looting of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and sinister atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this epic an epic quite different from those of the same period when everything was brilliant and glittering. I watched this film from start to finish fascinated. I can not say as much about today's "epics".
