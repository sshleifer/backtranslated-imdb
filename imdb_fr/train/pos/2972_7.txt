I have to admit that I'm a big fan of South Park and I was expecting basketball to be fun, but far from as good as it turned out! I think that's what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This movie has so much replay value and never cares to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker works perfectly. The kind of humor present at Basketball was not popular at the time of its release and if it came out today, it would be a hit. Do not try to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughter. Recommended to anyone with a sense of humor.
