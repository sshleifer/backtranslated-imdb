Am I the only one who has seen the link between Camus's discussion of the myth of Sisyphus and Mary's? in the Camus version, a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant rock he has to climb a hill. Unfortunately, every time he reaches the top, the rock slides and ends up at the bottom to allow him to start. there may have been a buzzard pecking in his eyes, I'm not sure for the moment. in the film, Mary spends her whole life fighting, but every time she gains ground, she falls and loses everything. for example, the evening she organizes where she is intoxicated, offends her lover of falafel and is practically under attack by Liev Schrieber. In case you question this theory, note how this scene ends with its attempt to climb a flock of stars as books fall from nowhere, preventing it from progressing to its ultimate fainting. the next morning, when she wakes up, she is still on the stairs, having never reached the top.
