In The BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a real US envoy to open Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before that, Commodore Perry practically penetrated Japan with gunboats and imposed a treaty on the Japanese in 1853. Harris, who arrived just a little later, studied the details and helped to ensure compliance with the rules. honor the first treaty. All this is true and shown in the film. According to other sources that I found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese geisha is essentially a fiction and this romance is at the center of this film (hence its title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction first When I saw this film, it was a surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat ?! When he is a diplomat in most movies, he says please and thank you, he hits people !!! Thus, to see him play a man who is NOT a man of action and who is able to play the diplomatic game seemed really strange. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen pictures of Harris and Wayne not much like him at all. <br /> <br /> However, despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange cast, the film is still very observable. The cinematography in color is nice, the film shows some interesting information about Japanese customs and culture and the acting is not bad. All in all, it's a nice film and pleasant to watch despite its strange cast. <br /> <br /> PS - Read the quiz of this movie. You'll learn a little more about real-life characters as well as an alleged fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where Wayne apparently knocked him out !! From what I read about Huston and how he gets along with the actors, it's an incident I tend to believe. And, it's also a fine example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
