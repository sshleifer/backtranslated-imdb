Mario Lanza, of course, is "The Great Caruso" in this 1951 film with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a very fictional biography of the legendary tenor of world renown whose name is still known today. <br /> <br /> The film is opulently produced, the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom and other opera stars featured in the film. If you're a purist, seeing people on the stage smiling at the "Lucia" sextet will seem odd to you - even though Caruso's wife, Dorothy, just had a baby girl. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that Caruso sang Edgardo to Lucia; the role was too high for him. <br /> <br /> By taking a dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was so remarkable about him was that he actually created roles in operas that are now part of the standard repertoire, but this is never mentioned in the film. Among these roles are Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in "Daughter of the Golden West", a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. The reason for this picture? His only shirt was in the laundry. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and forged a long-standing partnership with Victor Talking-Machine (later renamed RCA Victor). He sang Jos√© in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake. <br /> <br /> The story of the MGM makes him die on the set during a performance of Martha, which never happened. He had a haemorrhage during "L'Elisir d'amore" at the Met and could not finish the show; he only sang three times at the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as the film indicates, but the Duke in Rigoletto. Thus, when it is written on the screen "suggested by the biography of her husband Dorothy Caruso", this is what was suggested. What is true is that Dorothy's father disavowed her after her marriage and left him $ 1 of her huge estate. They also had a daughter together, Gloria (died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). However, Caruso had four other children of a mistress before her marriage with Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Lanza's voice is remarkably similar to that of Caruso, but just listen to Caruso sing in the movie "Match Point" - Caruso's voice is remarkably different from Lanza's. In fact, by his sound, if he had wanted, Caruso could have sung like a baritone. It is thought that he had problems with the high notes, further proof of the inclination of the baritone; and the role he was preparing for his death was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not. Lanza's voice did not deserve to be compared to another. He has made a unique contribution to the history of cinema by popularizing lyrical music. He sings the music of "The Great Caruso" with a sturdy energy; he is really here at the top of what would be a short career. His game is natural and authentic. Ann Blyth is charming like Dorothy and sings a little herself. <br /> <br /> Really a movie for opera fans and Lanza fans, which are probably the same thing.
