Timothy Hines '"Classic World War" is a very entertaining film that strives hard to faithfully recreate H. G. Wells' classic book. Mr. Hines succeeds in doing so. Me and those who watched his movie with me, we enjoyed the fact that it was not the standard and predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, for example. Spielberg's version with Tom Cruise that has only the slightest resemblance to the book. Obviously, everyone is looking for different things in a movie. Those who see themselves as amateur "critics" only want to criticize everything they can. Others rate a film on more important bases, like being entertained, which is why most people never agree with the "critics". We appreciated Mr. Hines 'efforts to be faithful to H.G. Wells' classic novel, and we found it very entertaining. This has made it easy to forget what "critics" perceive as its flaws.
