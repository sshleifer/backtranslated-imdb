A good movie that I will watch several times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there's a lot more going on than the headlines suggest, and I'm wondering how much time was lost in translation. Was there more in the original? Or was it expected that a mother tongue audience would read more? Or, since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which it is based, is it a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short, it's definitely worth watching, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original audience of 1913 had to put in. <br /> <br /> The release of Alpha Video boasts the new organ score, but in no way corresponds to the progress of the story. Of course, this begins in a promising way, but degenerates into a repetitive monotony, similar to that of Phillip-Glass, which reflects nothing of the action on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
