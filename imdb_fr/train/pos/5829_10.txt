This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts, and without a doubt Christine McIntyre's best performance with the trio. She is good in several other short films, but here she is absolutely brilliant. His singing is not funny at all, it's actually a beautiful beauty, but the plot is constructed in such a way that singing enhances humor instead of harming it. We listen to McIntyre sing the whole of Voice of Spring no less than three times, but it never gets old, partly because we do not get tired of his voice and partly because it mixes so well with the antics of the Stooges . The use of the operatic soprano in a comedy recalls the role of Kitty Carlisle in Marx Brothers "A Night At The Opera", but the song is much more present there than in "Opera" and McIntyre (perhaps more in performances other than here) presented a comedian talent that Carlisle never did. Stooges buffooning, McIntyre singing and a well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
