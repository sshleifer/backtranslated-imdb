The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit diner pamanteni" (could be translated as "The most beloved of humans"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that has become something like Bible or the story of Hamlet, very popular and difficult to understand, because of its satirical content on the communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual man, the humanist, in a "red" world. A film filled with passion, fear, sexuality, all the ingredients of a good movie recipe. One of the greatest Romanian films, despite its psychological burden (it's a European film, after all).
