I looked for this film because I am a new fan of Frain and I wanted to see more of his work. First of all, his Irish accent is great. He seems to have an ear for dialects. His game was wonderful, as usual. James Frain aside, I thought the movie was very well done. This showed the conflict in Northern Ireland as the real * disorder *. Both parties are guilty of serious injustice and men involved in the conflict usually have very little to say about their situation. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to realize that all men (or women) supposedly fighting for their country, it's really doing * just * that. For example, when Kenny (James Frain) asks Ginger (Ian Hart) why he does it, he can not come up with a morally acceptable answer. Why? Because Ginger is not there for the noble cause of the protection of his country or for the rights of his fellow Protestants ... Ginger is there for the pleasure of killing. He is full of bloodlust and it's the perfect job for a guy like him. In a fight like this, there are guys like Liam (John Lynch) who just want to live their daily lives and enjoy their family ... Guys who see that all the fighting is just beginning. There are guys like Kenny who are born leaders full of charisma and who fire rather than want to fire. In addition, Kenny sincerely believes in the "cause". He thinks that what he does will change the future ... which is a little strange because his character seems too intelligent for all that. But, like many other seemingly intelligent men, he is dragged into a gang lifestyle without even realizing it ... until it's too late. Then there is Ginger, a pure psychopath who does not fight for another reason, but for the only thrill it provokes, which, in a gangland war, makes him a valuable asset, could we say . However, now, in this movie, Ginger has lasted longer and has become a very dangerous loose cannon. <br /> <br /> Everything is reaching its boiling point and, as expected, the end is tragic. This film is worthy of merit is that it shows both sides of this age-old conflict. Being an American, I can not begin to fully understand what all struggle is. But I know there must be a better way. <br /> <br /> In summary, a film well played, touching, but disturbing.
