A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved to a small town and have to face a naughty teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a charming girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and a hell of a big secret. <br /> <br /> Ok, so technically it's a "bad movie". But who cares? It's so much fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (involving corn) occur, people panic about cat cats, there are bad one-liners, there is too much cheese to handle! <br /> <br /> So, yes. You will appreciate that. A lot. It will not touch you, touch you, scare you, or make you vibrate, but it will make you laugh and laugh!
