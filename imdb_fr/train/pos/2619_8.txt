If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead. Just like Tom Stoppard's seductive film, we see the action from the point of view of two of the original's minor characters: Timon, the meerkat with a penchant for the song in a hat, and Pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence problems. By following their story - rather than Simba's - we understand why all the animals bowed to the fact that Simba was introduced by Pride Rock. We discover what drove Timon and Pumbaa to follow Simba to Pride Rock to hunt Scar. And we discover how they treated the hyena once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets the best of the best jokes, but Ernie Sabella supports him with talent as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg taking over their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only drawback is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device that does not always help to advance the story. That said, there is a brilliant zoom at the beginning of the film. With more laughs than any other movie in a third series in a Disney series, Hakuna Matata is worth watching - if only for the whirlpool scene that's always funny, even if it's a not predictable.
