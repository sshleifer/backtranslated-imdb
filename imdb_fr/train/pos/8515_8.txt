The cast was good, and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, whom I like in previous films. The film was a great family film, nothing that could worry you to show it to young children, a good story, lots of laughs, a light and pleasant heart. If you want to entertain children without getting bored, it suits you. Kid nice, and not difficult for a parent to look at, either.
