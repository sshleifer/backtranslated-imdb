House of Games binds spells. It's so nice to see from time to time movies that are perfect dozens. There are few films I've seen that grab you so fast. From the opening scene, this film is important to you. <br /> <br /> I really try not to give too much to those who may not have seen it yet, but there will be SOME SPOILERS READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> I would say that House of Games is not just a great movie, but is the best scammers movie I've ever seen, without exception. As soon as the film is finished, it asks to be replayed. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her manner to the inflection of her voice, she immediately enters the role. Joe Mantegna was also great. The dialogues in this film have an almost imperfect quality and these two people communicate as much by their look as by their voice. I also loved the way the film was shot. In this granular and surreal way, he perfectly matches and helped make the film what it was. <br /> <br /> A few movies I saw and liked that made me think of including The Grifters and The Suspects usual, but really, House of games is completely different in its own way. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbent characters I've seen on the big screen and not only do they have a strong and palpable screen chemistry from the moment they meet, but the accumulation that starts from the when they saw each other. the other is electrifying. You know something is going to happen but you do not know what. And just when you think you've guessed what the "something" is, you realize you have not even scratched the surface .... <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of them of those films that can be grouped to some kind of film type but is essentially a film about human nature. The study of the character does not only concern the spirit of the scammer, but also the victim. As the film progresses and we know more about the main characters, we learn more about them, not only through what they say, but also how they say it. It's an excellent character study and the way it ends is flawless. <br /> <br /> In closing, I would rank this ranking on 10, even if it is not my absolute favorite film, on the list), quite remarkable and would go so far as to say that it figures among the best character studies and contains some of the best "twists" I've ever seen. Although I like all types and types of movies, when it comes to movies of the human psyche, it's really not better than that. See this film.
