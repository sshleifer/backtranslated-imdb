I have never seen a lot of online movies in my life, but if I chose one, I would choose Spatula Madness, a clever reference to most movies like star trooper (etc.), using a camera, and Jason Steele, a steel genius, has mastered the art of transforming a normal picture into a painting, then associating it with stop-motion animation to create a world inhabited by spatulas. the story begins in the middle, how will it delight directors? then the middle is at the beginning, and so on, when I first watched it, I was expecting a soggy look, but Jason, like me, likes the look, so took every detail to the fullest. Although I do not recommend it to children or anyone other than me, please, look for it on the net (it's a short film, look for cow movie), its style reminds me of that from South Park, but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for laughter and 6 for the story, it all comes down to a 10/10, good job <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I can not wait to see the movie.
