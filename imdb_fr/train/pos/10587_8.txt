This film is not schlock, despite lo-fi production and its link with Troma productions. A dark fable for adults. Farming is a theme of sugar cookies, and one wonders if the distribution was not a victim of this theme. A strange film with attractive visuals: shadows and contrast are predominant. This is definitely worth a look, especially Warhol fans and its elegant decadence. Through all cruelty and malice, a morality, even if it is twisted, can be enlightened.
