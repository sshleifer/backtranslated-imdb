I complained to ABC about canceling six degrees. If enough people do the same, it could be enough to revive this fabulous show! Just go to the official website and the rest is pretty simple. I do not understand why this show was canceled. What a fantastic show, actors and characters. The whole concept is striking! I'm surprised that my favorite show is over after just one show. Why is it? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV programs! Until I heard that they'd stopped him from a friend, I did not even realize it could happen.
