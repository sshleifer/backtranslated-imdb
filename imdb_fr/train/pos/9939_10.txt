It is a series of cartoons where the action takes place mainly in the human body, where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you will just have to see it yourself: You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it as a child in the 80s (with Swedish voices). I spoke with some people who were also children in the 80s and they loved that too! I have to admit that the educational part of the episodes did not affect me consciously, but the very idea of ​​educating children while having fun is fantastic. I recently saw some episodes; there is a humor and a heart that are hard to find in other children's programs today. <br /> <br /> 5/5
