The legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many who did not like it did not see the mythology behind the film. They expected something like Star Wars, and it was not that. I think Joseph Campbell would have liked this film. There were a number of hidden metaphors and meanings that an average viewer might have forgotten. We all have a mountain of swords in us. We all have to go to our own blood cave at some point in our lives. We all have to deal with our own insomnia one day. Admittedly, the narration was a little confusing, and some actions were sometimes a little hokey, but I think other points of the film easily made up for it. I would watch again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there's a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (The American version dubbed.) It would have may have been dumb for the American public, which would have really hurt this movie.
