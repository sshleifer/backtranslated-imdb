This movie is great. Simply. You rarely find a comedy with levels and it's a good example of that kind. When I first saw this movie, at the time of the credit, a friend and I looked at each other and asked, "Did you just take that?" For those who doubt, look at the levels. Look at the comparisons between Vick and the club people, DNA! Observe the different characters, each seeking his position, and if you do not see anything else, see the link between Vick's cure and the film's journey. Everything is in Vick's head! The first line on the world of Vick. The closing scene with the camera in Vick's head and inside a whole universe! Completely quotable, wonderful cartoon gangsters, handsome, handsome, handsome!
