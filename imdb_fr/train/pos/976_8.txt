Takashi Miike's incursion into children's territory seduced me almost immediately because he showed courage and courage in his treatment of fantasy elements. It's a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child, I thought most fairy tales had something sinister about them; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a little more scary (and more disturbing) than they seem at first sight. The filmmaker tells the archetypal story of a child in search of a wonderful quest in preschool class. It highlights the very real fears of a world filled with endless perilous missions. Westerners downplay the seriousness of bedtime stories written especially for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story, but he also shows signs of restraint. But Miike is still more alien than most filmmakers. I thought it was a good movie. Highly recommended.
