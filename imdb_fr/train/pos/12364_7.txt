Take advantage of the "demon-meeting-clergy" trend of the late '60s / early' 70s, which included in a very visible way the triptych "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist" and "The Omen", "The Sentinel "is a plus, it's just as good (although the most neglected of the lot). In a sense, it combines the best elements of these films and mixes with a dash of Polanski's "The Tenant" (released the same year) for good measure. A New York model unable to engage with her lawyer friend settles in a town house covered with moss that seems initially the ideal place; she meets an astute old man of a neighbor (the brilliant Burgess Meredith), as well as the other eccentric tenants. Held awake by loud noises over her apartment, she quickly discovers that a silent priest and herself are the only residents of the building, if not desert. From there, director Michael Winner ("Death Wish") throws this supernatural thriller and diabolical enthusiasm at the hallucinogenic torture he inflicts on his heroine. Backed by a brilliant cast, a subtle story and Dick Smith's excellent makeup ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a scary horror movie.
