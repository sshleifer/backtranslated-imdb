The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a group of famous girls. In their efforts, the older sister meets a drug dealer called Satin, whom the sister continues after being persuaded that he is the "great player" who will give her everything she thought she wanted in life. Although he may be accused of killing her, he only really kills his spirit and will to live, after which she becomes an addict and eventually dies of an overdose. The story is not about street life or about the Italian gangster who tries to buy Stix and then threatens it, it's how love can overcome even the worst tragedies of life as represented in the songs and style, as well as the time for young women who were trying to be "discovered" at the time.
