Here's another 1980s movie that most people simply ignore. This slow, picturesque film (Montana's loving landscape shots are breathtaking and reminded me of Costner's recent "Open Range", which also featured Robert Duval), and an emotionally satisfying film is the type of ideal movie to watch do not sleep or an apathetic Sunday afternoon. People in good spirits will be treated to a meticulous and intimate look at a family's sorrow and how they will recover after the youngest son slaughtered and killed the eldest son during the hunt. The performances are all excellent and discreetly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their performances, as are all support players and young actors. I particularly appreciated the way in which the director Cain (who, unfortunately, did not realize anything particular since the beginning, with the exception of the first "Young Guns") gives us a small discreet glimpse of the personal sorrow of each one. We do not only see the effects of death on the younger brother or the parents, but also on the confused sister, the lost uncle, his crazy wife and the girlfriend of the deceased teenager. What we essentially get here is the Western West's rural response to "ordinary people". There are also shades of David Lynch's "The Straight Story" in some of the stoic morals of Midwesterners portrayed here, as well as in plans that haunt the farmland they inhabit. This is one of the best and most realistic "larmoyeurs" of the time, and a nice little find for quality cinephiles.
