I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after watching a few episodes of season 1 on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for the brilliant quality of the show. I have not enjoyed anything so much since Firefly (also and amazing show). I admit that season 2 was not as successful, but there are still some incredible episodes (see Design this, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Diary, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec is great. I've heard of some of the projects in season 3, and I must admit I can not believe it was canceled - I will not spoil it - but it would have rocked! I also think he has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As proof of my obsession, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks allotted to me, I only have 3 episodes left after watching the two seasons twice. It's too good.
