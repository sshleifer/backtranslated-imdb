I watched the DVD of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (the English subtitles say that the character speaks Thai but the film says Cambodia) a very violent and perverse man raises boys to be killers using famine and drives them to beat and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the murder, the partner of a policeman is killed. The cop Wai is a cowardly cannon who worries about his father who is also a cop who has been shot and is in a coma. The Wai chief is his father's friend and worries about Wai's erratic behavior. He does not know that it was Wai who surprised his father in relations with drug traffickers, shot him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides in a sordid barrack where he meets a woman who has come here to find her mother and keeps saying that her father will not let her go (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand that , but saves her father who seems to have sex with her, maybe that's why (Cat III) .Wai is becoming more and more obsessed with the idea of ​​getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where she gets married and gets pregnant, Wai follows him and joins the naughty man (who trains the boys) negotiating an agreement to fight and so that he can have Pang There is a great confrontation between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman, the main victim, leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting off her child from the dead mother to let him die and leave him as next child likely to be raised as a murderer. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many violent scenes very brutal. The woman having a long nail pulled from her foot. Knives on the neck and torso. The guns fired directly at the head. And several very intense beatings. It may be intense and serious, but it's definitely worth it.
