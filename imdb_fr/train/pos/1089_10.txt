This film was shot in 1948, but still rings true today. Very very funny. It starts with a family that wants to buy a small place in the country and "builds" from there. Anyone who has ever built a house will find this film very endearing. Large distribution. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this movie. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the great style of the 40s: clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of things, and these comparisons with current costs are quite amazing. I can not imagine that someone is not enjoying this movie completely. I'm surprised how many middle-aged people have never heard of it. A real classic.
