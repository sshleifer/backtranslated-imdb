I have seen Mystery Men play a bit in the press and with the general public (take the imdb vote, for example), but my general feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, definitely more spiritual than most so-called comic and almost "astute" movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb; Greg Kinnear is excellent, as are Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limo scene with Ricky Jay is a perfect "spoiled movie star" and gives his character the right balance of comic quality and realism to make it work. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that the rhythm is a little off In some places, the visuals are certainly very bright, perhaps at the expense of further characterization, but at the end of the day it This is a great concept movie - it's about the little moments "What's Up Tiger Lily?" - and there are so many excellent ones in this film that deserve to be watched several times.
