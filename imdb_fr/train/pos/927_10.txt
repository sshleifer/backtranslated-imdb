"Father of Pride" was another of those good shows that unfortunately do not have a very long life. And it's pretty sad, especially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still aired (think in "The Simple Life"), I admit that many similarities with this show and "The Simpsons", but despite the similarities, the show has its own merits. The animation is just adequate, not amazing, but it's good. The best are the characters. All the animals are very friendly and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy have had their moments. The music was good, I liked a lot of songs. <br /> <br /> Even though the show is not very original, I think it had a lot of potential. Like "Mission Hill", a show that is not very famous but I liked it a lot, it did not have the appreciation it deserved. Too bad .
