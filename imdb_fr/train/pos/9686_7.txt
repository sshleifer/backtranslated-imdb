A sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It is about a little girl (with an impeded voice) who cherishes her green parrot Paulie. The parrot thinks and speaks as a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> The parrot is certainly the star of the movie. At once malignant and sometimes depressed, the bird captures the atmosphere in a remarkable and expressive way. The synchronized voice is also very well done and in a minute or two, you can really believe that this little intelligent bird exists. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, his father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the following scenes show him the story of Paulie's constant struggle for many years to be reunited with his mistress. One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people who use ATMs. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable, but who would want it otherwise. Children will love this movie and anyone who keeps a bird as a pet will enjoy Paulie's antics.
