Some movies just do not have to be redone. This is one of them. In itself, it's not a bad movie. But he fails to capture the flavor and terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent, as he always was, and most of the actors hold on, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not make the right impression on Luke's character. But the major flaw of this version is that it has moved too far from the story of Shirley Jackson to try to be grandiose and lost some of the emotion of the previous film in exchange for more vivid special effects. Once again, I will say that this is not a bad film in itself. But you will appreciate much more the friction of terror in the old version.
