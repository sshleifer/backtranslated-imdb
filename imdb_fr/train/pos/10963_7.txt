I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and cousin of these women, encourages the Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of a movie. They could certainly be considered as "skeletons" in the family closet. Among the additional features of the DVD, many contemporary fashion designers attribute some of their ideas to these weird women. I would say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion of these creators fascinating. (ie "Are they crazy? Or am I missing something?"). This film is hard to find. Netflix does not have it. Faceted does, however.
