It ran from 1959 to 1973. It's more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. It's also that she survived the fashion and taste changes of the 50's, the 60's psychedelic and remained popular in the 70's. <br /> <br /> I remember the rehearsals of this series. It is a successful combination of all of his stories, actors and productions that made him exceptional. Lorne Green had his iconic character from this series. His attraction was through the generations. All members of the family could enjoy it. It balanced morality with violence, humor with seriousness. A series of cartoons was created as a result of its impact. What is unfortunate is that this series is not repeated anymore and that many do not know its meaning.
