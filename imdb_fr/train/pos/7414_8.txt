It was a very nice film. A humorous but poignant look at the family and the obligations that flow from it. The story of a man who returns home from city life in his father's bath in a small Chinese village. There, he learns to appreciate, even to cherish the things he has left home to get away. The film is as beautiful visually as emotionally.
