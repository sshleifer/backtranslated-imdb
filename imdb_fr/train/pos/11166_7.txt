George Raft in the role of Steve Brodie, this dancing and carefree player who can never refuse a bet, is opposed to the heavy and sentimental Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). Soft to the touch for all beggars, Connors impulsively adopts waifs and lunatics, including an orphan hawk "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, with her kittens!) And the homeless Lucy Calhoun, an innocent of the city who aspires to become writer. <br /> <br /> In this predominantly male culture, communication takes mainly the form of violence (we see why THE BOWERY is a favorite of Martin Scorsese). Exploding cigars provide a gag. "Swipes" likes throwing stones through the windows of Chinatown, once setting fire to a laundry. (The simultaneous arrival of Brodie and Beery's volunteer firefighters gives rise to a fight, during which the building burns completely.) Beery casually undermines a troublesome girl and strikes anyone who disagrees with him, including including Brodie, whom he defeats, in a night fist fight on a moored barge to regain control of his living room, lost on a bet that Brodie would not have the guts to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes the jump, but only because a manhole subterfuge fails at the last moment.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills the frame of details, illustrating with taste the daily life of the net ; Singing waiters, intimidating bartenders, Suicide Hall whores crammed into the Black Maria, tailors who scaffold unfortunate street girls and force them to buy costumes they do not want. A small film but admirable little film.
