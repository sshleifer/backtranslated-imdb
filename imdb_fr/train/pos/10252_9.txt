After watching "Guinea Pig", two questions come to my mind (besides, "Am I really a psychopath?"): "Is this a snuff?" The answer is no ; although this is the closest thing to a snuff film I've ever seen. And then, 'Where the hell did they find this girl?' Because she is tortured for 45 minutes, for no reason (in fact, there is nothing else in this movie!): Torn nails, hit with hands, feet, tools, infested with worms,. .. and many more the final scene (I still do not know how they did that). Because it belongs to the 'Japanese underground scene', it is obvious that she does not have much money. So what were his motives? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japanese without subtitles, but it's not a problem (no real dialogue, the boys insult it just in some scenes). I have not seen the entire show yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be the best. I still noted 8, because if the goal was to make people believe that it was a snuff, the problem is pretty good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could have gone further, which they did in the following ones. <br /> <br /> Another film that I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
