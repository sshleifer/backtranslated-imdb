I was expecting it to be the same kind of schlock as Modesty Blaise's previous movie, which is why I left it unattended for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from being a succession of silly battles and chases by car / boat, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl can become as tough as nails, without anything either overestimated or too rational. <br /> <br /> It is likely that the budget constraints actually helped: less time and effort was spent looking for ever more stupid ways for stuntmen to pretend to die, and more were devoted to the enhancement of the film. Hell, the biggest rifle battle takes place off screen - and the scene where it is heard is all the better for the background noise that adds to the suspense - who wins? Who is dying? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as beautiful as Monica Vitti, but few of them are, and she certainly has all the class and fire she needs to make it work. character - and the shape of his face, his hair and his tall, slender body could have been raised directly from comic strip graphics. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a villain of Blaise, in which he made the character interesting and pleasant to watch - even friendly (and I doubt that I could consider assuming many brutal murderers and psychopaths as drinking buddies). I can not think of any of the "old waiters" in Hollywood who could have taken the role as well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise's villains are still dying, in the end (there are no spoilers!) It's really a good thing, because all the girls who would have spent all their time in fainting before such a disgusting and interesting piece can now be satisfied with us in a pragmatic way for us, the ordinary Joes.
