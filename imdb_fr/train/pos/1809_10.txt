All dogs go to heaven: it's the cutest animated film that had dogs in 1989. Don Bluth's previous film, The Land Before Time (1988), became a success. The dogs are so cute as little mice. Aw, I just want to kiss them when they are cute. Where was I? Oh yes. His animation is beautiful, the characters are great when they are perfectly expressed and the songs are cute and touching. It opened on November 17, 1989, on the same date as the little mermaid produced by Walt Disney. Animation. <br /> <br /> The part where Charlie was killed by Carface was so unforgivable. Carface is so mean because he wanted to kill Charlie. Shame on him! The song Love Survive performed by Irene Cara and Freddie Jackson was so beautiful. All dogs go to heaven is the best animated film ever.
