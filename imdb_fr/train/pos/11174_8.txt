Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King to date. No wonder, since King himself wrote the script. The story follows the installation of the Creed family in a beautiful Maine home. One of the other residents is Jud, a friendly old man who knows a little about the area. One is the highway that runs through their front yard. The other is a path to Pet Sematary, where children have buried animals killed by road for decades. Soon, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis (the father), is absent for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial place, beyond the Petatary Semaire, where the church is to be buried. Later, Louis is greeted (not so politely) by the church. He came back, seeming to have managed to get out of the bag in which he had been buried. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. I can not say anything more without ruining the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the adaptations of the king that I saw, it would be the most terrifying. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job leading the proceedings. The suspense is kept quite high throughout the film, partly because of the development of the plot. The scene where Gage is killed will stay in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. It's easy to determine what's going to happen, but Lambert realizes really scary and sometimes disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie and an excellent adaptation. If you like to be scared and do not mind being haunted by sometimes disturbing images, "Pet Sematary" is exactly what you are looking for. Non-horror fans will want to avoid this.
