The era of the film sexploitation of the late sixties and early seventies began with the permission of free nudity in mainstream movies and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. Her peak years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most beloved and talented actresses of this era was Monica Gayle, who had a modest but fanatical cult of followers. In reality, she was able to act, unlike many of those who played the lead roles in these films, and her subsequent credits proved it. And his deliberate concealment in the dark as his career took off only reinforces his mystique. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; No doubt too talented for the genre sexploitation, and his skill, combined with the presence on the screen of Monica Gayle, makes Sandra, the Making of a Woman, a pleasantly enjoyable experience. The movie will never drag and you will not press your finger on the fast forward button.
