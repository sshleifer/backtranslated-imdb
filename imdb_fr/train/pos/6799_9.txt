This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say you have to start early, but I must say I was a little confused from the start! <br /> <br /> Clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of Fairview Mental Institution and makes fun of believing he's a superhero. Clark is told that the life he knew was in his head. Delirious. He also finds unusual things: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair, legs cut after his accident on the deck. and Lana is devoted to Clark. But he finds a familiarity; someone else who is devoted to Clark: Chloe. He also discovers that a patient with mental disorders also belongs to the known world of Smallville. And the doctor is an escapee from the ghost zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me of an episode of Buffy called "Normal Again", where Buffy begins to have waking dreams on a mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that all she knew was a product of her imagination and that she was actually mad. Her parents were still married, they were still living in LA, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her boyfriend and she did not have a sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires did not exist either. The two episodes are a little sad because doctors do not just tell the characters that everything is a product of their imagination, but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and that brings us back to reality. It's good, though, to have a sense of reality from time to time, but we watch these shows to escape reality. This is also good because the characters have to overcome new challenges.
