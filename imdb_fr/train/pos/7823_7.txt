A long but compelling account of the friendship between Steve Biko, civil rights leader, and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest. We see the bond that has formed between the two men and mutual help, but the second half is not as strong, because of the elimination of the character of Biko. Yet it's a compelling film with great performances by Kline and Washington in the film that put it on the map. Washington has also been nominated for the first supporting actor. Overall, a movie well done that could have been reduced a little. 7/10 .____________________________________
