In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is deemed not to be ready for the great game of the man who loves him, Van Heflin. This film certainly constituted a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his support for Oscar, the year before, in "Johnny Eager". <br /> <br /> Was not Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of five children, four of whom are like her grandchildren? <br /> <br /> The songs and dances are beautifully staged, but the way the flourishing romance between Heflin and Garland was portrayed left much to be desired. It was a Gigi-like where a girl is finally swept by a charmer.
