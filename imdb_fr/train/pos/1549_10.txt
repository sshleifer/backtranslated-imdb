There are movies and there are movies. Films are most often cinematographic "sweets", whereas films are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well placed in the second. Like most viewers, I was very impressed by the battle scenes, but the striking character of the central character's portrayal is what I consider the most remarkable quality of the film. Having done everything possible to serve her country as a true German girl, while suffering from morphine addiction, Fraulein is treated very morose by the German High Command, despite all his efforts . The scene in which the Doktor is transported into the back seat of a Mercedes Benz command car, alone, sorry and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest and most true representations of a spy spell. " in life. Only the emotional pain presented by Richard Burton in the movie Spy Who Came in the Cold is timely. Fraulein Doktor is a film much deeper than the one that can be realized by sight. I only wish that its producers see fit to release it on DVD so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again enjoy (perhaps again and again) this exceptional film.
