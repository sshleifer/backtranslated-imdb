"How to lose friends and alienate people" is a superb movie. A hilarious film from start to finish. A charming artist. Appreciated. Low-blow! <br /> <br /> Performance: Jason is fantastic. It's a treat to watch it from start to finish. Jeff Bridges is excellent as a boss. It's a legend. Megan Fox looks incredibly hot and offers a good performance. but dude, she's so hot! Anderson is delicious. She does not look old at all, still hot. Kristan Dunst is lovely and doing a great job. Others are also very good. <br /> <br /> "How to lose friends and alienate people" is an excellent artist. Do not miss this movie!
