This last episode of Voyager begins in 23 years. Voyager has gone home. In the many years it took to return, the spirit of the Vulcan Tuvoks was destroyed. He had an illness that was too late to go home for treatment. <br /> <br /> Captain Janeway meets extraterrestrials with time travel technology. She realizes that there is a Warp conduit in the Delta Quadrant that could bring Voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and warn Voyager. There is a problem. The conduit is deep within the Borg space. <br /> <br /> Janeway goes to Tuvok. He is like a child. He scribbles, obsesses, works on math problems or on movie reviews or something, he's convinced he's important in some way. In the institution, Tuvok cries and asks Janeway to please. Come back to him please. <br /> <br /> Janeway decides to requisition a shuttle from the federation and equip it with weapons technology 20 years before the Borg, hoping to go back in time and use this new technology to guide Voyager to the Warp conduit. <br /> <br /> When she goes back in time and gets closer to Voyager, Janeway will meet her young person. The two captains disagree, arguing over the plan. The real captain visits Tuvok to ask him if he is suffering from a brain disorder. Tuvok admits it's true, but the ship's facilities do not heal him, so he kept it for himself. <br /> <br /> The young captain accepts the plan of the older captains. To increase their chances of success, the oldest Janeway plans to distract the Borg with her shuttle ship. The Borgs capture Janeway and her shuttle. Queen Borg personally equates Captain Janeway. But Janeway expected it! Queen Borg has assimilated a virus that kills her. With Queen Borg, the dead Voyager brings the Warp Conduit back up to the space of the federation.
