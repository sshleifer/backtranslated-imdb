Does anyone know where and how can I get a copy of this movie? !! I have been looking for too long, someone is helping! In 1997, my friends and I were extras in this Long Island-based film, and we were never able to see it. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping to find a copy to finally see and share with the girls! Is there anyone who knows where to get a copy, so I can also stop making me crazy? (Plus, no matter if its format is in VHS, I'm still in the glaciation.) If you, or one of your acquaintances, have a copy of this movie, help me, I'll be willing to pay for a good copy!
