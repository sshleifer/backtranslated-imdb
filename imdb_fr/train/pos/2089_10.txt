"The Good Earth" is an excellent movie you do not hear much about. There are many big disasters and events, but it's also a non-passionate love story. All of this happens in just over two hours, which is short of current standards. The special effects and costumes are very good for the period. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a constraining role. It basically has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and upset. <br /> <br /> The representations of the Asian and American-Asian actors are fantastic. <br /> <br />
