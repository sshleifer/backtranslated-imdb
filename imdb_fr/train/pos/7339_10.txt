Since I heard about the Ralph Bakshi version of "Lord of the Rings", I wondered: What is rotoscope animation? Well ... I finally discovered ... I saw this film about three years ago not knowing who Ralph Bakshi is ... And I liked ... a lot ... Very good scenario ... it even has a small character development that is great for a cartoon ... See if you're bored with contemporary animation .... Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's is just a beautiful cartoon ... It's a very good movie too ...
