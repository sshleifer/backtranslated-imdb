You have to be honest and say that I did not see a lot of independent films, but I thought it was very well done. Management and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction. The angles, settings and lighting used to create the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped. Many images of the film, haunting and memorable, remain engraved in your mind well after its end (always the sign of a good director).
