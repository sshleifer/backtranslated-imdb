Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you must like "My Left Foot" (and especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis in this film). He plays Christy Brown with cerebral palsy. For this reason, he spent most of his life in ostracism. Even when trying to warn people of something, they make fun of him. The light in the darkness for him is that he controls a part of the body: his left foot. He uses this appendix to paint and write poetry, thus highlighting it. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan worked very well on this collaboration, as well as on a later collaboration: "On behalf of the father" (but "the boxer" was useless). "My left foot" can make you feel many senses: sad, hopeful or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis gave the performance of a life here. A good movie in every way.
