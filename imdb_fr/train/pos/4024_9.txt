I liked this movie a lot. It let me guess right before the end what was coming. One of the best movies on the score I saw. Urmila Matondkar is beautiful too. It's one of the most personal and down-to-earth movies I've seen on the score. It's a little less traditional than Gadar and it's really a touching roller coaster in which you start with an opinion of what's going on and get out completely on the other side. This is not a typical Bollywood dish, but rather an art-house movie. The best part of this film is that it does not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict by focusing on another's story. He does not blame or reproach you, but rather allows you to draw your own conclusions.
