There are some excellent comments and observations on this movie. I had the pleasure of noting the comparisons with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the aborted 50's remake with lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (Jeffery DeMunn's extraordinarily beautiful performance), eliminating his sexually frustrated anger at his victims - mostly children. He is the goal. The real villain is the stifling Soviet bureaucratic system, drowning in its own corrupt incompetence. The frustration of a dedicated man without compromise (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), an easy pragmatist who is willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland still succeeds in this kind of role), a man hesitating , scared but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), the gruff and gruff bureaucrat of a prosecutor (the brilliant British actor John Wood) and the discreet wife and assistant of the trained investigator (the charming supporter, Imelda Staunton) . It's a good movie. Its darkness and darkening are corroborated by the description of a corrupt and incompetent system that undermines success. It is not necessary to delve into the sharp sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present - it's a horrible story - but it adds to the description of a human being pathologically twisted. The success of the story lies precisely in the fact that they were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or me. When you and I choose to express our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo has attacked our most innocent and vulnerable, our children. The superb premise of this story is highlighted by an equally superb casting of excellent actors. --snately, I notice that our Australian friend did not like the speech and would have probably preferred to hear them speak in Australian dialect. Well, it's a shame. This beautiful movie certainly worked for me and everyone else I talked to who saw it.
