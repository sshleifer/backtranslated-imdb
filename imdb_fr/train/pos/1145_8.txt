It's a romantic comedy that focuses on comedy to change. As usual, lovers - Sally Field, Celeste Talbert, queen of the soap opera almost over the hill; and Kevin Kline as a slightly talented and talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson, work against the tide, seemingly unaware of their crazy love, and so on. Partly thanks to Bette Davis' Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950) and as a whole Well in the theatrical tradition of slapstick, Sally Field goes beyond hilarity in finding her way to love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the most underrated men in recent years, is also very good and very successful because he manages to be beautiful, vulnerable, selfish and lovable at the same time. <br /> <br /> The center of misadventures around the fear of losing her audience while she is in her forties, and reaches the critical point with the arrival of her niece, the budding actress Cori Craven ( Elisabeth Shue), who turns out not to be his niece, with conspiracy complications that ensued. Cori manages to get a small role in the soap opera as a dumb mute homeless man before discovering his true relationship with Celeste (and with Jeffrey Anderson too) - but that does not matter. <br /> <br /> As romantic counterpoint or Robert Downey Jr. (soap opera director, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan) are the main protagonists. David Barnes is so exciting for her, but she's only interested in one thing: getting rid of Celeste to shine stronger on the set. To this end, she asks Barnes to do all kinds of things to ruin the career of Celeste, but, by chance and / or according to a perverse logic, all his attempts are futile, much to the delight of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show's chief scriptwriter and her alter-ego and Celeste's confidant, while Carrie Fisher plays a modest role as a producer of the "Looks Good" series ". <br /> <br /> I thought it was funnier than the only other parody in the world of the soap opera that I saw (Young Doctors in Love in 1982, who burlesque the General Hospital Television and was pretty good). Soapdish is funnier with a daffy storyline and lots of funny liners and great performances from Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. But let's see that for Sally Field, which is remarkable.
