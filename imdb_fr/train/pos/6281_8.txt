I had the chance to watch several movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This film remains to its wonderful action and its great history. Although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent image this one is not. Not having this movie on DVD facilitated the purchase. I have always enjoyed intense action and excellent acting that do not always go together. All in all, this makes this movie an excellent and fun movie to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies, you get either two things. An almost crystalline image without distortion or a film with a granular HD image. I was disappointed when I made my first Blu ray movie. I almost started thinking it was a standard Blu-ray. Although after watching other movies, I know better. I do not think they spent as much time as they should have transferred this film to HD. This is usually the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray discs, you should only have the best picture. So I consider it a profitable investment for people who have never seen the movie or bought the DVD version.
