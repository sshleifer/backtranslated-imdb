The shower remains in itself in many ways. Almost all of the film takes place in an old-fashioned bathing establishment, where locals bring humor, pathos and emotions. The love and friendship between the owner and his belated son are deep and moving. The way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems untrained and persuasive. The plot is sinuous, full of surprises and irony, and touched on the whole by a feeling of what I would call neighborhood in the relations and conflicts between the performers. It's a movie that I go out when I want to believe in the world.
