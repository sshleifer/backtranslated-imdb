Although criticized critically, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is a film that must be watched closely. some of the fun pieces are made by the way and do not get the usual attention. For example, keep an eye on Michael Keaton's use of the pricing gun at the pet store ... as well as the documentary style years that appear at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those rare films where humor unexpectedly hits you, even if you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really strong - If you liked her best known movies (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should take a look at this one. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is extremely friendly in the lead role and the secondary cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended.
