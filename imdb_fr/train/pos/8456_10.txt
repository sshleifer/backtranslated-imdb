I watched almost every Gundam / Mech cartoon presented in the United States, which has by far the best story. The way his plot turns and turns was riveted. Gundam Wing is a series focused mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old boys who have been trained to pilot advanced mobile combinations known as Gundams. The Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful insurgency called Oz. As the situation warms up between the pilot projects of OZ and Gundam, new political groups are formed and the old ones disappear. Old conflicts will end and new ones will emerge. To gain peace, Gundam pilots have to face the events unfolding in their world and put an end to all fights. But how far are people willing to go to achieve their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a show that has a deep plot.
