This film tells the story of this poor guy who decided to become a spy for a prestigious high-tech company, Digicorp. Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his miserable life in the suburbs and his demanding wife. He decides to become a spy. He is supposed to go to the conventions of other high-tech companies and know all the projects of these companies. Instead, Morgan finds herself attracted by a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and is nearly doubled by these two companies that force him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get by? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan survive? Wow! What a nice movie! I was completely sucked after 15 minutes of watching this movie. It's very moving and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion as he does his best to stay alive. The scene where they put this horrible gear on Morgan's head to brainwash it is brilliantly scary and frightening. Morgan is slowly making a personality transformation that is not as obvious as when you think about it once the movie is finished. Of a cowardly type, badly combed and badly combed, he becomes a man who fights for his life. <br /> <br /> The end, wow, the end is amazing! Twist is so much fun! It left me panting and cheering like crazy! Good performances from all over the world, including Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie!
