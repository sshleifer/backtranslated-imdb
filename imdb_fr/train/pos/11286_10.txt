I recommend watching this movie with your partner if you are planning a romantic evening with him / her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan in the role of Tarzan and Jane is so hot that it could fog your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle. and to each other. Jane's jersey in the jungle and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers their visitors show that they are not only in love, but also very sexually in love. <br /> <br /> Everyone's imagination can complete the touching and loving discussions between Tarzan & Jane to show how Jane really teaches love to Tarzan emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student not only embraces her previously untapped sexuality, but also thrives. <br /> <br /> The show of the skin in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's sexy costume for the belly, legs and hip, she also enjoys swimming underwater with Tarzan. (Although it is not O'Sullivan, but the Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller also reveals a formidable body and perfect pecs in his loincloth barely there. The ladies will be delighted when Weissmuller emerges from the water after her long fight with the giant crocodile and utters a scream - with her loincloth soaked with water almost falling from her hips. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that it's too protective The censors have attenuated the adult character of Tarzan's films after this entry. Although Weissmuller Tarzan's films may still flourish in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this film.
