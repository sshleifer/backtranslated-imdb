The best martial arts movie ever made. This film is better than anything Bruce Lee has ever done. A classic with a completely entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu. It's a shame that Bruce Lee was so overrated that it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie reigns !!!!
