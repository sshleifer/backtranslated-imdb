Father of Pride was the best new show on television since Family Guy. It was another masterpiece of the talents of Dreamworks Animation. As in The Simpsons, the show is centered on a nuclear family (white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable secondary characters, including Roger, the ugly orang-utan, Vincent the Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the fake patriotic Snout Brothers and Chutney the Elephant. The other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a great way, making the most mundane activities entertaining. The combination of cute animal characters with a very adult dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is at the origin of the program. <br /> <br /> The fault of this show is the responsibility of NBC. They chose to broadcast the episodes in no particular order (perhaps influenced by the stars they could promote) rather than a more logical production order. Many times, the show has been preempted for an extra half hour of dreck such as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of that were not enough)! It is indeed a bad omen for the future of television as art if an original and bold show like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the complete series is released on DVD and the show now has the opportunity to acquire a wider audience. 10/10
