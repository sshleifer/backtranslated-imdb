Although Stardust seems to be a fantastic movie with a predictable end and average performance, this is certainly not the case. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure movie. He has this magic "aura" from the beginning to the very end of the film. The scenario is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like any tale, it lacks morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will not take the throne, but the innocent boy who manages to overcome all the obstacles and difficulties that he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material, shallow, manipulative girl. <br /> <br /> I have to give Claire Danes extra credits. She literally shines in this movie. His eyes have that spark that perfectly matches his character. Plus, she and Cox have a chemistry that makes romance in the movie even more noticeable. The rest of the cast is made up of well-known actors and actresses, which of course make Stardust an interesting and high-class film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is fantastic, the magical places and interesting plot. Was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more prizes. I must give at least 9/10 stars for this.
