I would not call "We're back! The story of a dinosaur" simply a children's version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Like the previous one, it calls into question the security of bringing back people from one era to ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Child Julia, Kenneth Mars, Yearly Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase this: a given actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" host, the most reliable name of Info, a famous chef, the "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy. <br /> <br /> But I guess I should not just focus on casting. I thought this movie was something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). It's true, it's escape, but insightful. In fact, I would say that John Goodman interpreting Rex's voice here is sort of a forerunner of his vocal work in "Monsters Inc." Worth to be seen.
