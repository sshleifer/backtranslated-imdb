While the British produced hilarious and smooth sitcoms in the 1990s - Ab Fab, Men Behaving Badly, One Foot in the Tomb, and so on. - the 70s were the true golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, there were new territories to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism and slowly evolving consciousness of a need for "sensitivity" that, twenty years later later, would become political correctness. Attempts to tackle the confusion of this deeply modern world were the subtle and not so subtle themes of everything from Monty Python's Flying Circus sketches to sitcoms like Man About the House. (In the late '70s, this "fight" resulted in more meditative and bitter sitcoms like the Butterflies masterpiece.) <br /> <br /> Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time - slightly elegant, cheeky, fresh, ingenuous, sometimes scandalous, with some well-made observations on contemporary life. Compare it to a cynical show of the '90s, like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe that both were created in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man About the House is one of the great British artists of the 70s, right. up there with Good Lovers and George and Mildred about the house. Its quality is evidenced by the fact that, as in the case of Good Neighbors, its creators, writers and many of its actors have always had success on British television.
