I saw him at the Legacy Theater at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I will assume that the level of satisfaction of this film will depend largely on its degree of acceptance of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> However, other than that, he was very well done, well played and had a good score. If you arrive in Salt Lake City, you must definitely see it at the Legacy Theater. I've never been in such a beautiful theater about the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound and the atmosphere of my life ... I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins! Since I am SDJ and consider Joseph a prophet, I have been touched in many places and have been crying many times ... which I suppose is expected because they distributed handkerchiefs BEFORE the start of the movie! Anyway, I am told that this film is available in several LDS reception centers around the world. If you have 70 minutes, check it, because whether you believe in Joseph Smith or not, it tells a fascinating story.
