Good action and interesting plot. After seeing the original, I must say that it was an interesting improvement and that I saw more of the film. Good distribution .. meaningful actor .. although it would be nice to see more expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story. Fun movie to watch and stay alert at all times 7/10 is a good vote, I think!
