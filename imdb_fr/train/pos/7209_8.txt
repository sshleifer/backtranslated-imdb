I bought some movies on disc even though the second-rate presentation was not an option. A certain company that I will not identify here has produced several scanning and scanning dvds ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80" and this one, to name just three!) Movies that I do not think not that anyone wants to see. in this compromised format. Some discs offer the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are just in their theatrical ratio in 1.66 format: 1. <br /> <br /> That said, my chest, I would say that "Deathtrap" was Spooky and strange enough, funny picture. My only complaints are the tiny score (what is this instrument that is usually dragged for movies shot in the 18th century in France?) And Dyan Cannon screaming at regular intervals. Could not his character have been an asthmatic who had used an inhaler when she was stressed? Minor complaints, both. The benefits of discs include the ability to move quickly to go beyond what you do not like. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a staged version of "Deathtrap". As a result, having these people in good impression roles of their career at the time. Before the tickets cost an arm and a leg, the theater was more affordable for ordinary people. Now, anyone paying less than a king's ransom for live entertainment will probably not be attending a successful show on the same track. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve were both great male specimens in the early 80s and this is an integral part of how we react to their profession and their overall image here. These are certainly not bookish men who can not fight or who will not back down in front of an obstacle. Both are just as good as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate "death trap".
