A passionate regard for the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. The movie is made up of films that are not easy to rely on in their works, particularly the premières, the époque du silence. Thank you very much, I've done something I've had a long footing, I found that I had one of the best documentaries on film at this time. Visionnement obligatoire if you admire Martin Scorsese and I work.
