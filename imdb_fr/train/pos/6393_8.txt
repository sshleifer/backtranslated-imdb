It is a must for independent moviegoers, but it is also resistant to mainstream movies. I think we have the ingredients of the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is very low. No special effects, and they apparently used the ambient lighting (filmed in digital video.) - And yet, this film grabs you and never lets it go. The scenario is a bit odd, but the actors and the director achieve it with absolute realism. There is humor, there is intrigue, there is pathos and everything works together. <br /> <br /> No need to describe the details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece <br /> <br />, a virtual lesson on making a low-budget movie that really works, check out this one. <br /> <br /> -Oh yeah, it's also REALLY entertaining. <br /> <br />
