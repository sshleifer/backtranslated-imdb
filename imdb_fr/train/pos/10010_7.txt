There are many diseases that are born in the mind of man and that came to life in modern times. The constant vigilance or information accumulated in the field of Pyschosis has occupied psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists with enough work to last for decades. Sometimes, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by people unaware of their cure or even their existence. This is the premise of the movie entitled "The Night Listner". It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spends his evenings thrilling his audience with lively stories about gay lifestyles. This may be because his show is losing his authentic veneer, so that noon admits he is no longer himself. Abandoned by her lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks refuge in his growing despair and isolation. It's here, a mysterious voice in the night is asking for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice that belongs to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). By reading the heartbreaking manuscript of the boy, which describes the beginnings of life and the sexual abuse perpetrated by his brutal parents, Noon is captivated and wants to help. However, things are not what they seem to be and Midi is soon wrapped up in an elusive and bizarre story drawn from a medical nightmare. This film is purely Robin Williams and without Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum in a pop style, it could be comical. Instead, this could prove to be one of William's most serious performances. ***
