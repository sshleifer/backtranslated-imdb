Do not expect a representation of the "truth". However, the stories of these veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan call for thought. <br /> <br /> The film's main asset is that it vividly describes the wartime words and wounds of these veterinarians and their post-war struggles to rebuild a certain degree of normality and functionality in their life. <br /> <br /> My major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious deficiencies of the programs of the armed forces and veterans to help those who have suffered and are still suffering the trauma of war. These are not fatal flaws of the film. <br /> <br /> As a veteran, I know that the terrible aftermath of the war is real and that these young men and women express it very well. These veterinarians vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment experienced by most veterans and that ordinary citizens need to understand, because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disruptive.
