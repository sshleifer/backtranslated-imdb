This film is not only an excellent film for basic cinematography (screenplay, acting, setting, etc.), but also for its realism. This film could take place in any farm or rural setting. Whether the film takes place in Louisiana or Kansas does not change anything. The story and the messages it contains would remain the same. This film shows the family values ​​and connections that unite an older audience, while showing youthful behavior for younger viewers. Everyone who watches this film will leave with something that will have touched them personally, I know it. The end is way too close to home so I can not burst into tears every time I look at her. The end emphasizes the importance of agricultural safety, and anyone who has worked on a farm must see this film. Failure to pay attention and be negligent puts you in dangerous situations. <br /> <br />
