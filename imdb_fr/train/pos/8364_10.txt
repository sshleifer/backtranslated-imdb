Robot Jox does not suffer from stories or bad effects. I mean, it was in 1990 if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 always used stop animation like most movies throughout the 80s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period, most of them did what they could with special effects available at that time. It was only when Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released the following year that a technological breakthrough was made and the story's Internet users began to use this motif. But you'll have fond memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, or even Power Rangers, if you watch this movie. The enemy robot is very threatening. This does not make you want to face the man without a very good backup plan. And there are great moments in this film. A traitor / spy works in their environment. The person you think is at your side, supporting you completely, could be the person you did not expect to be she / he is. And it's very embarrassing to think, you do not agree?
