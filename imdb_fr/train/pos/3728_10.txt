Never heard of this movie, I saw it on DVD. Great movie, perfect example of a movie that took every actor to make it work. No typical Hollywood movie overhyped with the same old overhyped actors. No one quote "One" list actor could They could remember me from my experiences in the army after the Vietnam War. He focused on the people who were sent to fight. As described by the characters who had fears and emotions, although some volunteered for the service. They were ordinary people too, some were not made for military life, I remember some of my experience - to put it mildly, could not adapt to military life either - but I will never forget them - should have stayed I highly recommend it and then think about those who serve today in Afghanistan. The basic training is a trip, note that the exercise sergeants are not in the morning and that they may need a "sensitivity training" HA! HA! HA!
