I went to this film during a casting cast and crew because my friend, who is a producer of the film, invited me. Forget what you saw in the ads, forget what you've heard, go see this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised by that. In a world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The 6th day, Unbreakable, here is a movie that is worth your hard-earned money! Glorious scenes, a wonderful cinemtrophy and a casting that you want to eat with your heart. I thought it was one of the most orchestrated films of this year and with good reason. Robert Deniro deserves an Oscar. If you could give an Oscar to everyone involved, it would be the movie.
