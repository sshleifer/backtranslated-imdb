It was modesty we did not know! This was mentioned and summarized in the comic book for unions to sell it to newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were real fans of Modesty Blaise to whom The Dream Job had been entrusted. Tell a previous story of Modesty that fans had never seen before. In their audio commentary, they admitted to having modified the origin of his text to make the story more fluid. The "purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything she said to Miklos was true because she was "wasting time". I did not rent or borrow the DVD as other "reviewers" did, I bought it! And I do not want a refund! I watched it three times and did not sleep through! Great dialogue and well-drawn characters that I held dear (even the wicked Miklos), just like in novels and comics! Me too, I can not wait for the next film of Modesty (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what will happen!
