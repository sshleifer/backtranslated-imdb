My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie. He is now on a Russian fishing boat and said that the film that had most impressed him and that he had kept in mind all these 39 years is the film The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He asked if it was possible for me to get this for him. I'm sure a lot of things go through his head because he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on board this ship for 3 months and he will have 3 months before the expiration of his contract. Since we have Indian blood, he connects to this movie. On January 27, he will be 47 years old and I wish I could get this film for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for 17 years and, as we all know, is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
