Purple Rain ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think that all the actors have been well chosen. The film had a beautiful story. I liked it! Since I watch this movie, I'm stuck in the 80s and I'm only 13 years old! My favorite part of the film is when his father died and he collected all his compositions. Apollonia was sitting in the stairwell, ears in hand. Critics say it's a drama but I think it's more of a romance. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, he acted like himself. I'm so happy to have seen this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so sincere. I cried more than once.
