Zombie Bloodbath is a movie directed by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the Horror genre. If I understand the comments and the things I read, it was done during the great flood of 1993 in the Midwest when half of Missouri was underwater. The buildings were under water. cars and houses were under water. An article said that the zombies and the crew of this movie would help the river to make sandbags after shooting every day. The fact that this film was made is a miracle. It's like a huge brew of all the zombie movies ever made through a Troma filter. It's a party movie to enjoy with friends who love a lot of splashed and clumsy characters. And he's fast, energetic and really funny. <br /> <br /> A toxic spill accident in a nuclear power plant causes people to melt or transform into zombies. The local government covers it, destroys the factory and builds houses there. Some changes of terrain (?) Induce the opening of a cave and new residents discover it and release the undead of the newly built community. From there, it becomes crazy, bloody and fun. <br /> <br /> I read these reviews a few times. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this funny little film three times as a different critic, using false names. They use the same words and phrases. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's raw. There is trouble playing. The same goes for half of the films. There are many more worse than this fun movie. If you hate this movie so much, do not buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and call the crew or launch "Trailer Trash". And obviously you do not live in Australia or England. It is simply shocking that this excellent service, the IMDb, does not surprise people who use it only to throw more. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not mind. I give myself bad and good reviews. But it is painfully obvious that some fools just want to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "critics" even pursue their "criticism" in court simply to promote their own films. We called this movie Boring - well, love it or hate it, you can NEVER say this movie is boring. It moves quickly and never has a dull place. <br /> <br /> Oh and this commentator from the Netherlands ??? Um - LIAR. You tried to post this same comment on Amazon and it stopped there. The same criticism only indicates that it came from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This absurdity must stop. Love it or hate it - give it a real opinion or do not type anything. It is obvious that you have not seen the movies. <br /> <br /> But for the record, I have and even if it is not the best I've seen, it is far from the worst. And even the worst, I would give a glimpse of what I would do without personally attacking the director. <br /> <br /> I hope this advice will help some people to see through the stupidity that is happening here.
