For me, it's the most perfect Ealing Studio movie - as fresh and relevant half a century later than the day it was released. <br /> <br /> As a satire of the economic notions of "growth" and the commercial necessity of intrinsic obsolescence, it could not be more current. And what other movie can we say that the hero literally carries the plot? <br /> <br /> Strangely, there are parallels with Jurassic Park, in which playing with the environment will literally turn you over and bite you. But Spielberg moved away from the brilliant central claim of the book to break nonsense about "children". Hmmm. <br /> <br /> In The Man in the White Suit, Alec Guiness embodies a young idealist scientist who invents a garment that never gets dirty and never wears out. Suddenly, the workers and capital of the North England factory where he works are uniting more than ever to protect their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Ealing is a comedy, but that should not be the case. The complex interplay of vested interests (should it be appropriate?) Is a perfect fit, with all parties realizing that "progress" is a threat and that availability and waste are what make spinning looms . <br /> <br /> But, yes, it's a comedy - even if it's sharp - and, in the middle of political ironies, delicious shows and good old laughter that joke. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's biting satire. which lasts - dazzling and white.
