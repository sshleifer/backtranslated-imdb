Very good point there: "only a few elite members (the upper classes) would have both access to the Internet AND would be able to communicate on an exclusively English site, such as IMDb" Some might think that the Internet is not a reality, but this view really the media society and democracy at stake: you're probably right .. Even though there are cybercaf√©s in Venezuela, most supporters of Chavez will not allow themselves even to rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> You see liberal intellectual boosters, far-right capital capitalists, rich, upper class. Probably this is your first Internet use;)
