In your life, have you ever participated in a sports activity, tried to do your best, and then you found yourself in an important part of it, where, for a brief moment, you were lucky enough to be a hero, a champion and. . . failed? I believe that many of us have lived this moment in their lives. This is the premise of the movie, "The best of times". In this story, a middle-aged banker, named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), suffers from the deep melancholy of a football mistake, which occurred years ago, is inspired to replay the game. . again. To do this, he must convince Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) to return. For Reno, who is satisfied with his current fate in life, does not see the need to change the background, which improves with age. Added to this is the fact that the years have passed and their marriages are struggling and need to be revamped. Not easy when his stepfather (Donald Moffat) usually reminds him of the biggest drop. Nevertheless, Dundee is persistent and will do everything to try to correct the biggest mistake of his life. Very fun for those who wish to enjoy their youth again. ***
