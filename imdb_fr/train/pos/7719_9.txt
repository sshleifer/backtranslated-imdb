If you like Star Wars / Trek, come see where they found all their ideas and cinematographic devices. It's my top 2 favorite movies of all time, futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Storm") is not overshadowed by a spooky gadget (both Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, do not assume you can see the strings that hold the flying saucer. It was the first movie where you could not. Miracle, it was made on the scale "A-movie". The economic situation and the tastes of the time were strongly counterbalanced. And the previous success of the director Wilcox was "Lassie Come Home". Until I look at it, I assumed that Fred Wilcox was a pseudonym of a director who became famous or later, but at the time he did not want to be associated with science fiction, a genre strictly "B". at the time. It was either a VERY visionary production or a fortuitous "mistake" on the part of the people who finance Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are gigantic real-action mattes inserted almost under the microscope that Lucas has used extensively. There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotyped "user interface"; "computers" as they have been described in a much less futuristic way in later works. The "carrier" of Star Trek is there, visually, virtually unchanged by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the technobabble Trek / Wars disables you, FP's scientific credentials are not excessive and are all accurate even nowadays. The whole "ship" is complete, sparkling realism, at the height of everything you've seen since and more convincing than anything Trek did for television or cinema. We did not spend as much time there as I would have liked. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies get into space with such skill, watching FP tells you all that. It's definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
