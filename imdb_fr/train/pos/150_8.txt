The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children who are victims of violence and isolation in their remote community become troubled young adults who need some psychic tools to deal with their mental fragility. hidden. Whether these tools are a religion followed at a fanatical level, caring for others or simply putting a macho image while engaging as a prostitute, Villaronga creates a successful review of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco . The three witnesses of the disturbing double death or their friends before adolescence and then bury the emotions they experience with their peers, frail corpses, until they find themselves again in a hospital for those who suffer from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> the cinematographic style of the text is visually opulent, as one might expect from the Spanish author, and is reminiscent of the work of his Spanish compatriot Pedro Almodovar, who discusses themes dealing with sexual desire, heterosexual and homosexual. An element that differs between the two directors is that Villaronga favors a supernatural connotation assembled with a claustrophobic and sober realism opposed to the use of surrealism by Almodovar, although the two styles are similar. young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature. I highly recommend watching this movie because it contains elements that will stay with the audience for a considerable period of time after viewing.
