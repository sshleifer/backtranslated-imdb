The Grand Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He has great acting skills and is very fit as a singer, accompanied by Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I dare to say that he plays some songs better than Caruso (check A'Vuchella Tosti and La Danza Rossini). The art and music departments of the MGM have also done a good job. This film could be perfect, if only without the awkward presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she does her best, dressed in the style of the fifties in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserved a better star and Blyth should stick to less demanding productions. Also note that Mrs. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with Lanza, giving the misconception that Caruso had some kind of permanent soprano.
