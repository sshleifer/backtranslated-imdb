Sam Fuller's excellent PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is one of the many low-budget, low-budget black vehicles of the 1950s. PICK UP ON SUD STREET is rugged, explosive and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Widmark plays the role of pickpocket Skip McCoy, which has already been picked up three times. Still, McCoy can not keep his wandering fingers out of trouble - and the problem is exactly where he slips when he grabs the wallet of gangster whore Candy (Jean Peters). Candy's wallet contains an invaluable roll of microfilm for the communist movement, and it's her last job for ex-boyfriend Richard Kiley. However, when Widmark throws him up, Peters must do what is necessary to get the movie she does not know (at first). <br /> <br /> This is a tasty staging, with the character of Widmark, but not the psycho of KISS OF DEATH, a real live-wire, unpredictable and difficult, but curiously charming. When Bogart or Mitchum went into a movie role, you knew what you would get: a lone anti-hero preserving his moral integrity and winning in the end (Bogart), or a laconic guy who lets himself be trapped (Mitchum ). With Widmark, you simply do not know what you're going to get and, with his incredibly modern playing style (his movies are always good), he's amazing to watch. Here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film, or handing it over to the police and fighting the "Commies" on the right side of the law. And he must still claim that he never flew Peters to avoid the fourth fatal rap on his sheet. <br /> <br /> Peters gets her best role as a moll-to-a-heart-golden candy. The unpredictability of Widmark may be better expressed in his scenes with Peters; the gorgeous wanderer quickly (and incredibly enough - the angle of romance is rushed enough) falls in love with Widmark, yet Widmark alternates between kissing or slapping her. Peters's hard beauty, but the lack of over-lacquered Hollywood glamor (Lana Turner would never have worked so well in this role), is a major highlight for the film. Candy is not innocent, but she is very vulnerable, she is constantly passed between men and slapped by men. Widmark hits her on the first date and wakes her up by pouring beer on her face. Yet, in the final act, he is much more tender with her (after she had the chance to miss Kiley). The scene at the hospital with Peters and Widmark should not work, but it is. <br /> <br /> Thelma Ritter is brilliant as Stoolie Moe, who deserves her Oscar nomination. Ritter's performance, like everything else in the film, is serious, real and sincere. His death scene is beautiful. Fuller's camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. Fuller enjoyed close-ups and PICK UP ON SUD STREET is full of uncomfortable tight shots that only reinforce the tension of the plot. Fuller is not afraid to let the camera linger longer than Hollywood's Old City allows, but moves away from Ritter's death scene to give the audience maximum impact. Unusual and confrontational urban locations and camera angles give PICK UP ON South Street a bold, modern look. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
