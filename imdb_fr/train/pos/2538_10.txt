There are so many good things to say about this movie "B". <br /> <br /> "B" may be related, but not in committee. It's about the best of the kind I've ever seen. A quality effort of Universal. The scenario is well done, imaginative and flawless. Scenario: Howard Higgin's original story & story by Douglas Hodges, John Colton (screenplay). Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex history and places of the story very well. Do not skimp on the loads of extras and places. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts' mother in "It's a wonderful life." The woman, Frances Drake, is a beauty and treated her role gracefully and pathos for her husband, Karloff.) I remember When I saw it coming in. As I said, there were so many good things: the African discovery of radium "X", the casting of the stone statues (which is a little reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians in And then, there was none) Christie) (Barry Fitzgerald's version)), Karlof's glow in the dark. Karloff's mother embodied by Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance. And because of all these virtues, I found myself believing in the science he portrays. a good work of art.
