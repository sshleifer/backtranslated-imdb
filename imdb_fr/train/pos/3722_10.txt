First of all, I saw this film without knowing anything; I knew Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see him at a Danish film festival called the Night Film Festival, which brings together a large number of different films released after hours. /> <br /> Anyway, my friend and I went to see him and we were amazed at how real it seemed and how he really touched a chord. the end is a big plus in our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative "Dogma 95" launched by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In The Dark). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the film is really worth seeing, it gives a different point of view on the situation of American GIs. Joe, who comes out of school, should serve his country in combat, far from home. <br /> <br /> In addition, Colin Farrell is exceptional in this film. I have never seen it before, but I can not wait to see it. more of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
