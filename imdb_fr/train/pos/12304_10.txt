It's a good movie. I like him when he goes down to get his ink and the skeletons pursue him, but luckily he dodged them, opened the window and did not even notice them. Xiao Qian is very pretty too. and when he stung the needle in the buttocks of my Wu, it's hysterical. and when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth, standing between two swords is also great. then also the party where he eats his rolls while watching the guy kill many people. then you see him singing poems as he runs to escape the wolves. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute together. Add comic timing, giant language, and you have both horror, romance, comedy. not to mention great special effects for the 90s.
