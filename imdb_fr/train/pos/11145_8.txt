After racism, the rural exodus - also known as rural migration - is another socio-political problem of the 1960s. WestSide Story treated racism with a feast of love from an artistic perspective. Midnight Cowboy is now dealing with the rural exodus through a psychological friendly tragedy. The tragic end is that we are witnessing the disappearance of one of the two companions of fate. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger cleverly shares the deepest thoughts, dreams, dreams, fantasies, fears and fears of New York scums. While the handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women in the world begging him to share a wild amorous fantasy, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in a clean and sunny Florida. As a result, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality. and Ratso becomes a thief who raises enough money to migrate to Florida. In addition, Ratso helps Joe find a way to do everything he can. They start sharing everything in life. They share food, share medicine, share an uninhabited house, share their income and share a destiny. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being beautiful is not the only thing to do that all beautiful women beg him to have fun; and what's more, Ratso can not see Florida because his heart is torn by illness while he was on the bus driving him there. <br /> <br /> The power is always right and the Feeble is not entitled to the light of day. From there, "Midnight" gives the factual show. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Each aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable fate. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative vision of a socio-political problem, the rural exodus.
