Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-running fiction film exclusively dedicated to the Internet, made entirely for the sake of the series and not to be missed by Trek fans. The quality of the production is extremely high for a film of fans, even if, sometimes, we can say that they are green. This does not detract from the overall experience. The CGI ships are fantastic, as well as the scenes of space fighting ... On the negative side, I could say in the previous episodes (and even sometimes in the most recent) that certain actors / actresses are not very comfortable in their scenario. roles, but again, this does not detract from the overall experience of Star Trek's new interpretations. The actors and the technical team have really come up with something special here, and overall I highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
