I love this film, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√© ... almost everything has already been said about the film, but there is a detail that I would like to clarify: no sequence of reality, still standing, Hotel du Nord ( is it still? I heard that it was going to be demolished ...) was used for the film - the entire scene was rebuilt on the set, mainly because they could not stop the traffic on the Canal St Martin for several weeks.
