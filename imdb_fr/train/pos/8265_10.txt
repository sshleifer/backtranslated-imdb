The name of this film alone made me want to see what it was. So I recorded this movie during the early hours of the morning. If you have always wanted to see what the miners had to do during the first days and see a dramatic scene when the mine collapses in front of the men. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and become friends after the First World War and how the Germans came to the rescue of the French miners, to the disbelief of the French townspeople. The actors were all remarkable, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a little boy working in the mine. There is an old retired miner who eats down the mine on a ladder when the elevator breaks down. If you're a real movie buff, it's a movie you will not want to miss.
