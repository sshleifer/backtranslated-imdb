Romantic comedies can really go both ways, you know? You will see one that is really ugly and you will want something more realistic. Then you will see one that is realistic, but perhaps too boring to stay interested. Or maybe you will see one that will do all right, but that will not make you smile. Romantic comedies are difficult movies. You approach them with a lot of expectations, and generally, whether you like it or not, it's simply a question of whether the film anticipates your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course. If you have a girl next to you and you're a guy like me, it does not matter if the movie is good or not, you have something else in mind. For you, I say, "Go get her, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "See _A Guy Thing_". This is very fun. <br /> <br /> Because, a guy knows you're going into this movie with expectations, he does not pretend that his "guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams and it's not his wife! "the plot will make everyone happy. Of course, maybe you like it, but maybe it does not sound right, or you think it's cruel. A Guy Thing covers that. What Guy Thing does is fill the screen with the best support distribution I've seen in a long time. If you do not follow the main plot, you always have something to make you smile. <br /> <br /> Whether we're talking about veteran big screen and big screen veterans like Larry Miller (Best Woman, Best Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien Regular, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), we are talking about a heap of very talented and knowledgeable actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the inspired characterization of the film, steal the series many times and continue to frame the piece with energy and joy rarely seen today in romantic comedies. <br /> <And that must not hurt the line of romantic lines and the stars who wear it, because it is very soft and sweet always well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Amy Chasing, Dogma, etc.) is moving as a young professional whose life may lose control. for the guy who is really. <br /> <br /> The success of the film is largely based on Julia Stiles, the right girl at the right place at the wrong time, and she is doing well. Since then, I do not know when, I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that made her so easy. Of course everything is in close-ups, the voice and smiles subtle, but it's magic, and that's one of the main reasons we go to the movies in the first place. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles the sophistication a little off would be lost without the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly crazy by its classical simplicity. It's a film that depicts a broken world of irreconcilable stock types, makes them fall on each other to make you laugh, and then goes on with a lot of heart. <br /> <br /> Guy Thing is a movie you've probably already seen, and filmmakers knew well when they were set up. We have not really seen any new romantic comedies since Shakespeare; the relative success of this one or of this one depends entirely on the execution of the classical story of the boy meets the girl. A Guy Thing embraces this with a metacinematic side, often taking the scenes in the absurd in order to give the public the opportunity to recognize the powerful emotions and the ancient intrigues of the plot in play. <br /> <br /> In Summary, he even manages to make fun of the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that are the center of any romantic comedy, so that even feminists could kick it. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you're trying to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are some of the coolest guys in the movie industry, I'm just suggesting to you, "That's a guy, "and leave that to it.
