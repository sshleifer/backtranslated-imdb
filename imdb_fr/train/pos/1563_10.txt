I loved this episode. It's so good that all five team up to stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are invited! I just hope that Clark will join the Justice League and we can follow this group of heroes around the world !! =) It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested in what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as a Watchtower, which would be such a cool thing for her to do beyond the Daily Planet, because she does not have super powers. Also, I want to know what types of Lex topics will use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers have other people in the world !!!
