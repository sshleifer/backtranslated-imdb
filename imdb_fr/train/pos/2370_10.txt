It's a great American martial arts movie. The fighting scenes were quite impressive for the American film of the 90s. Of course, the fight scenes are not as good as in the Honk Kong movies. In fact, only a few American movies have fight scenes that are as good as in Honk Kong movies, even nowadays. When you watch a film about American martial arts, you expect to see scenes of less impressive fights, while maintaining beautiful movements, which can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least, that's what I expect from this movies. I was impressed by this movie. Some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, the staging and the plot were pretty good, so it's a movie that's really worth seeing, if you like martial arts movies Americans of the 90s.
