The Five Deadly Venoms is easily K.F. the most memorable. a screenshot of the Shaw Brothers stable (except maybe Master Killer). The artists who ended up being called simply "The Venoms" are among the best combat choreographies of all time and, surprisingly, for a Kung Fu movie, a fantastic scenario! One of my favorites of all time !!!
