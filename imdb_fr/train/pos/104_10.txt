This film had an interesting cast, it did not have a list distribution, but the actors of this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have quality movies like this, the story is basic, the actors are basic, and the way they do it, you do not need a budget of one million dollars to make a film composed both of the list of a basic plot. I like the way they had the street for themselves and that there was nobody else around. What's interesting is that they did not close a caf√© to install their equipment and they did it from a police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen have done a great job in describing their roles in hostage-taking. It was a good movie and I hope to see more in the near future.
