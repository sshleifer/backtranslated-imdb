This whole movie is worth watching just for the wonderful final moment - it's the best ending of all the movies I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I find this film charming, even with the French meaning of the very serious meaning of the meaning in French. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I liked the way the Algerians were woven - and besides, the music in the final credits is excellent. I want the CD!
