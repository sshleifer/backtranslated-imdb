The 74th Oscars was a very good one. The work of Whoopi as EmCee was very funny and light. Personally, I loved his last appearance, which caused frosty criticism because of foul language and dirty jokes, but that's fine. The audience seemed to like that. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier have made a television broadcast of the Oscars to remember. <br /> <br />
