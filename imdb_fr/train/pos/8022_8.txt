Jim Henson's Muppets were one of my favorites since my childhood. This film makes me feel like a kid again. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The principle is that they try to play Broadway in a musical show outside of New York. You will see cameos from New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film will be 25 years old this year and I hope that today's children will learn to appreciate the lightness of the Muppet band. The problem with the series is that Kermit disappears and the gang has to find him in New York. It's worth looking for children and even sentimental adults like me.
