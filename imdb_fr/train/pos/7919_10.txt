Undoubtedly intended to be a totally campy joke, "Full Moon High" describes the 1950s teenager, Tony Walker (Adam Arkin), accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Of course, Tony gets bitten and grows fur and fangs every time the moon is full. A particularly interesting aspect of this film is that it can not age as long as it has the curse of the werewolf and it must fulfill its destiny, even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, the movie is just funny once it starts. The character of Ed McMahon is a right-wing yahoo too patriotic (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars coach / director is a tense dweeb, and then there is more. Demond Wilson, who is best remembered as Lamont in "Sanford and Son", is one of the most open-cast cast members. He is a very surprised bus driver. But the funniest scene is probably the change of president. so gag with Gerald Ford really summed it up! In any case, it's a real treat. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an Oscar Sunday night and thanks his sons, I wonder if he remembers if he played with two of them in this movie (except Adam , his son Anthony also has a small role). Quite funny. With also Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: Director Larry Cohen is probably best known for his killer movie "It's Alive".
