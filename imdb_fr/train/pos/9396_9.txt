Nicholas Cage is a powerful and silent hero, Dennis Hopper a murderous maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle a vampire / tramp, and the late regretted, J.T. Walsh as the heavyweight. These are the types of roles that these four can play in their sleep, and they have done it often enough to see them replay at the border. What a relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master who manages to give a little atmosphere to a good action, makes this thriller black and nuanced. Hopper manages not to go beyond, Cage is a bit deeper than his usually superficial action heroes, Boyle is sensual, innocent and conspiratorial, and we feel like the iron of the soul is central. to his character, Wayne. The direction given by Dahl gives an idea of ​​the void in the Big Sky country where the story takes place, while being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled eyebrow can indicate a radical change of plot in store. The twists in the plot are excellent, and one of the other big twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters act as if they have a brain. It is not common for minor characters such as deputy sheriffs to have more brains than their superiors headlining. But with a director as intelligent as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything related to this film. An excellent movie.
