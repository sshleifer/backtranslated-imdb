Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau have started and finished their career together. Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood's most acclaimed comedy teams in the last 100 years. Not as "hot" as Pryor and Wilder, they were rather the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such as physical comedy as well as the mix of chaos for which Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous. In The Odd Couple, Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually about themselves as opposed to passing it on to another. It's not a typical film, it's kind of a comedy in adulthood with two old men, unlike two young teenagers in their youth. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is quite entertaining. Although this film is not for everyone, it's a great comedy.
