*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, "The Divers", is really interesting. All I knew was that it would involve Nazi history, underwater scenes, and everyone would speak Danish. But I decided to check it for a reason, the fact that the story evolves around a German submarine submerged by World War II. I have a fetish for German submarines, especially wrecks on which to dive. So I was a little skeptical about the Danish part, but I thought the submarine could weigh that part. Knowing that Nordic films are not always good and that I'm not sure about the size of my budget, I was very skeptical. <br /> <br /> When viewing, I was ... surprised. <br /> <I had some thoughts on the shortage of actors, noting that some are very young, the two main actors in particular. It was not a problem, they both performed very well. Like other actors, composed mainly of people aged 50 and over. This creates interesting interactions between young and old that are not often seen on screen. Not unique in any case, but a little rare. And all is fine. <br /> <br /> As far as Danish is concerned, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was not a problem, there were subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I imagined that there would be interior shots as well as submarine exterior shots of the submarine. After deciding that their budget was thin, I thought it might be satisfying at best and quite awful at worst. Once again, I was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes very realistic. Having a fetish for German submarines, I knew what the submarine should look like, especially indoors, and I was not disappointed. The team did some serious research. Everything is fine. <br /> <br /> I suspect that more people than me will watch this movie just to see some scenes of shipwrecks, so I feel obliged to issue a "warning". The submarine in the film is not a real model that existed during the war. It's a special sub purpose. But to give you an idea of ​​what to expect, this is a cross between a Type VII, Type IX submarine and a Japanese I-52-type transportation subcontractor. He is a well-designed god who makes a beautiful wreck. <br /> <br /> The decor is on a Danish island or peninsula, I do not remember. It's summer and two brothers go to their grandfather's house to celebrate the summer as they do every year. Their grandfather is a sailor. The cinematography is rather pleasant, many beautiful summer scenes on the docks of the island, new teenage loves, a pleasant weather for diving and a general feeling of "perfect". Once again, everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, the island hosts visitors of the suspect type, a group of men rents one of the boats, an old minesweeper and his crew. One of the visitors, a man in his fifties, is wearing a German eagle and a tattooed swastika on his back. Island elders all remember the fall of a German submarine towards the end of the Second World War. Since then, rumors have circulated about Nazi gold in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who searched the sinking submarine shortly after German bodies began to float on shore in 1945. No submarines were ever found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT <br /> <br /> The key elements are Nazi experiences, Nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, love of teens, plot and ... a surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this film and it took me to guard. Not being a big fan of supernatural events, it is nevertheless well in the history and poses no problem. It's not like "From dusk to dawn" where everyone turns into vampires towards the end. It's a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> GLOBAL: Really a good movie, I gave it a 8. Some are due to the fact that it's not a Hollywood film with unlimited resources. I later learned that his budget was fair and that some of his actors were veteran Danish veterans. But even if it had been a Hollywood production, I would give it a 7 or an 8. It's really worth it. Yes, a child's story somehow, but again a mature tale. There is a lot of suspense and a great aura of adventure, which I found very seductive. And, again, cinematography is really nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
