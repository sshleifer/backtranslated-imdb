One of the most nihilistic and brutal films I have ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving. It's a melodrama of action as the world has never seen it before. Sometimes, the plot had brought me to tears, while in the next moment I received shocking revelations as a fatal blow to guts. Frightening performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK-Cop and a Cambodian killer who continues, while gradually losing his humanity, is strong. Presenting very little dialogue in favor of haunting imagery and hard camera work, "Dog Dog Cock" is purely HK-Bloodshed without heroism.
