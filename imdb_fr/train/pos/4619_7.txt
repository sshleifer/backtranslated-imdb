First of all, I'm a big fan of 80s movies and Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday, I wandered into a local second-hand books / movies store and found a VHS copy. I read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99, it was a good deal. So I took it home and inserted it into the VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age now, I'm more connected to films like About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 years old and in love with an older guy, etc. we are younger. And if it does not work, we are heartbroken and we think we will never recover. But of course we do. Several times. It's that kind of sweetness that this movie really brought me. The feeling of "Oooh, I remember when something like that happened to me ..." is everything. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who loves 80s movies, especially teen movies, or those who simply want to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
