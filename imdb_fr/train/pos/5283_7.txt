The scenario for this film is simple, as is the scenario: an elderly Muslim asks his teenage son to drive him in his similar break, from France to the hajj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in order to fulfill he's dying. The father is clearly pious, but the son is not impressed; he accepts by obligation towards his father rather than by religion, he prefers to be with his girlfriend (non muslim). The father is stubborn in many things that the son does not understand and the petulance that separates them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often quite tedious. However, as in any good road movie, strange characters meet along the way. For example, a Croatian woman in Croatia who asks to go to Belgrade simply puts herself in the back seat and points to a word that she assumes to be a place but does not find it on the map. In Bulgaria, another man asks them to confirm their ability to speak French but then provides a detailed comment in Bulgarian. There is also sometimes humor - in a country, the son gets tired of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - we give them a goat, but unfortunately (luckily maybe for the viewer), he s flee before the father can perform the ritual of the Muslim massacre. They finally arrive in Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners, it's weird but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated but seduced in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with a soul.
