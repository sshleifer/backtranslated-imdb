Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow, a working-class girl from Brooklyn who falls under the spell of rogue Clark Gable and who has problems of all kinds. The film begins like his film, but in the end, the emphasis is definitely on his character. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Gable playing a street game with his partner, Garry Owen, and the brand screaming for the police. When he is hunted, Gable breaks into Harlow's apartment and he is so charming that he protects him. <br /> <br /> Very quickly, she is involved with him and, unfortunately, with his rackets. Gable, Harlow and Owen try to play Paul Hurst, a drunkard, but Gable refuses to do it. Of course, when Hurst realizes it was a problem, he is always painful and belligerent and Gable must hit him. But he finally finds himself in front of Harlow's apartment and his platinum blond hair makes it easily identifiable. She is an accomplice to manslaughter. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is hers and her adaptation to life in prison. Her interaction with the other prisoners gives her very good scenes. I think some of this material was later used for the classic MGM Caged. <br /> <br /> Harlow also plays the title song. It is interpreted as a ballad in the style of the torch, very popular at the time. She speaks / sings in the manner of Sophie Tucker and very well. <br /> <br /> Gable is a good actor who develops his consciousness, a role he often plays, especially in my favorite Gable film, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> It's still Harlow shining in this movie. I think it's one of the best she has done at MGM, her fans should not miss it.
