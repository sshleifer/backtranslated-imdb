I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in an acute care facility. Over the years, I have seen people die from haemolytic reactions after a blood transfusion, attended numerous lectures on blood-born pathogens, and seen many patients become seriously ill from blood-borne pathogens. transfused. I also heard from many Jehovah's Witnesses that they would die if they refused to receive blood and that after 26 years in the field, I never saw it happen, leaving the question "Is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or grand taking advantage of the battle on this issue? "The question of Jehovah's Witnesses is of a moral nature. "You must refrain from blood" is not an ambiguous statement. Thank you for this movie and allowing comments.
