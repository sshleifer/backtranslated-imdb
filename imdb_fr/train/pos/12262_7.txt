Thirty years ago, author Numa Sadoul published an interview with a feature film by Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (better known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This movie catches up with Sadoul today as he recalls the interview as we listen to the tapes (Herge died in 1983) and see old photos and pictures of this man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at Herge's request, and we now know that they were discussing his separation from his wife, after he had an affair with one of them. of his collaborators (who, a few years later, would become his second wife). . One interesting thing that the film does not deal with is the passage from the first right-wing imperialist books (Tintin in the Congo, Tintin to the Soviet countries) in Tintin's books, to the rather anti-imperialist books a few years later (The Lotus blue). Overall, I come out of this movie knowing more about Herge and seeing it a little more improbably than when I come to the theater.
