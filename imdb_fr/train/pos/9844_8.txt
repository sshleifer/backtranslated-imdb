There are very few movies as funny as this one. I was lucky enough to see this film in the cinema "reserved" for moviegoers like me, so it was not so embarrassing to laugh until my jaw was completely painful and my shirt sleeves were wet. have dried my eyes ... <br /> Sometimes the story was a little "slow", but maybe it's for the better - a little rest between the aisles in the aisles ( I almost fell off the seat ...) was welcome.
