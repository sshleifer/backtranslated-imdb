It's a really fun movie, especially the second, third, and fourth time you watch it. It's a nice short film, and I highly recommend watching it more than once, you'll have it the second time. <br /> <br /> It's like Spinal Tap but the rap version. This has a lot of attitude, which can be negative in rap-influenced movies, but it's just a total catch and it's not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> A lot of great pieces, one of those types of movies you'll find yourself quoting lines with your friends, and it will spark laughter. <br /> <br /> What I prefer are the "guerrillas in the middle" section. Super video, superb!
