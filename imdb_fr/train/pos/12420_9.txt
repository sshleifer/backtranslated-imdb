A success at the time, but now better ranked as an Australian cult movie. The humor is broad, not very subtle and, in the final scene where a studio fire of the BBC goes out when urinating, brutal. Contains just about all the clichés about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to "the old country" and all the clichés about raptors, the brave Tory Brits. Would be acceptable to the British because of its strong presence of well-known actors, and for the Australians of this generation, who can "get" the humor. Americans - forget that. The language and jokes are in the Australian English dialect and as such will be unintelligible.
