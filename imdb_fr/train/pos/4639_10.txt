I had it a few weeks ago and I love it! It's modern, light but full of real life complexities. He asks questions and answers, just like Eytan Fox's other films. This is my favorite, with Jossi & Jagger. This is much more, universally, than the bubbles in which we live. You do not have to be Jewish or gay to enjoy - I'm not, but the movie goes straight into my top ten movies. At first it sounds like pure entertainment, but it makes you think further. The relationships with which we must live are superficial, significant, profound, fatal, call them. You do not know what will happen, and you certainly do not know where this story goes when you watch it for the first time. It is worth seeing it many times. Fox's movies include great bonuses - here a great clip and the "making of" (explanation of the title, interview of Lior Ashknenazi who plays himself in the film and Arabs with doubts about Israeli lifestyles) .
