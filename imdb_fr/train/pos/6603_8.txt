I must mention two failures for you to understand that this film has brilliantly succeeded where they failed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortal Ad Vitam". If you were excited about the concepts of these two films and you feel terribly disappointed (like me), you will probably enjoy Renaissance. It plunges you into the world of a Parisian future. It's not quite dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscopic, but from what I can tell, it was not, it was just a motion capture. The facial expressions are incredible! Since TRON, I have never seen a fantastic world as well presented in a hybrid animation / live. The black and white medium serves to slowly draw your attention to the subject of the scene. my favorite effect was what they did with the beam of lights, watch for it. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but you are finally happy to find the thread he wants you to find. The overall effect is a harsh and grainy urban world filled with little surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it's not terrible. It's black-ish. There is a story for most of the main characters, which gives them some depth. There is time. There are "sets" so that you can feel as if you are in different parts of Paris. There is action and even a car chase. I'll have to see this one again to have everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see because the "decorations" are detailed and the credits are small.
