I only saw this film after hearing praise for it for years. Needless to say, the current experience has turned out to be somewhat anti-climatic. But still, Alec Guiness energetically directs a magnificent casting in England, in the post-second world war, after World War II. <br /> <br /> It is the well-known story of the misfortunes that led to the invention of the perfect everyday product. Do you remember the car driving on the water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear, does not wrinkle and does not even dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified by the prospect of bankruptcy. The plot thickens a bit. <br /> <br /> Guiness makes the whole business profitable, and watches it blow up a the factory research lab, over and over again, is just great! (These British ... always have stiff upper lip when they are under fire.) The film might well follow the same invention as Guin's awkward invention, but it's still good conduct.
