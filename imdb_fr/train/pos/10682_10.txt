A few years ago, the UK Gold satellite channel promoted the rehearsal of "Men Behaving Badly" with the hype: "Here it is, the original colocation sitcom!". It was actually wrong. "Man About The House" was also a shared sitcom from 1973 to 1976. <br /> <br /> It's the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom "Father Dear Father" . When that ended, they decided to do something more in harmony with his time. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) arrange their apartment in Myddleton Terrace after a wild party during which they find a man in their bath. This is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a student in Southampton, homeless. While his clothes are drying, he puts on a ladies dressing gown and prepares a meal for them. They are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there must be no naughty affair. So Robin must pretend to be gay ... <br /> <br /> In "I Love 1973" of BBC-2, aired in 2000, Julie Burchill claimed that "House" had shown her a way of life she envied. She was not alone. One of the most iconic images (for me, anyway) of the 1970s British TV was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London Underground with an umbrella, and a "blind" man making a double take while his troubled bottom was passing . <br /> <br /> A man living with two girls was a risky subject at the time, but Mrs. Mary White did not need to warm up under the collar; it was an innocent and good-natured amusement. The scripts of Mortimer and Cooke got as close as possible to the edge without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan was still playing "Bingham" in I.T.V. when it started. In fact, the second cycle of 'In Charge' intersects the first of 'House'. He was born to play Robin, the crazy sex. "Chrissy" by Paula Wilcox was more streetwise than "Beryl", her character she played in "The Lovers", while "Jo" by Sally Thomsett was a loveable blonde. Over time, he became almost an older brother for them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show under the name Ropers at War. George had lost interest in sex, but not Mildred. They then participated in their own show, aptly titled "George & Mildred". The late Doug Fisher was a good value, like Larry, Robin's great friend. He worked so well that he became a regular. <br /> <br /> Less than a year after its debut, there was the inevitable spin-off of the film. I'm not a big fan of the movie 'Man About The House' because I think it has been put to the test for the big screen. Most of his characters had never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became the long-time "Three's Company" featuring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was much more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often dressed in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, "House" ends with Chrissy marrying Robin's older brother, Norman (Norman Eshley). The fans were devastated to see Robin fail to find the girl he loved, but the fact that he also won his own series - "Robin's Nest" had something comforting.
