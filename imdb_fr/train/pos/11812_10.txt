This film is the best movie to watch for the cartoon sensation. The sets, costumes and colors are so vivid that it's like entering a comic. It's the film I'm thinking about when it comes to the crowd, costumes, hats and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is comical, like Mumbles and you can not help but complain about Madonna trying and failing to convince Tracy. This movie contains all the classic clich√©s of the mafia: bury the world in the concrete, blow up cars, bring back the good guy and try to blow up the house of his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in the true sense of the word. the word, even the angels of the camera scream a comic. It's so great to be able to go back to an old movie and see that someone knew how to turn a comic into a movie after seeing such errors as Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> !!! YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM !!!!
