I just can not understand the negative comments about this movie. Yes, it's a typical romance between boys and girls, but it's done with so much talent and refinement that time passes very quickly. Henstridge (talking about winning the gene pool lottery!) Is as magnetic and appealing as ever (who says that the golden age of cinema is dead?) And Vartan holds his own. <br /> <br /> There is a chemistry that simmers between the two leads; the movie is more alive when they share a scene - a lot! It's so good that you feel ready to bring them together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments - if you feel a little blue, watch this movie, you will feel much better. If you are already happy, you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33 years old, I'm from the UK and I'm a hopeless romantic, always looking for her princess ...)
