A wish to cherish is a wonderful film. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was also good, although different from the movie. It really made you think about how you would react if you were in the character's shoes. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, ALL !! <br /> <br /> Although the production is not quite Hollywood quality - no big special effects - yet, the values ​​and ideals portrayed more than make up for it. And the distribution has done a remarkable job in capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them falls ill. <br /> <br /> You do not want to miss this!
