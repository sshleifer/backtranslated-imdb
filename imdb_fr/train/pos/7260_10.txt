Hi everyone, my names, Larissa, I'm 13 when I was about 4 years old. I watch the curly girls and it hits my socks. I watch this movie for a long time. In fact, about 30 minutes ago, I just watched it. . Alisan Porter is a very good actor and I love this movie. It's so funny when she hands out the cards. Whenever I watch this movie at the end of it, I'm crying because I know I'm only 13, but it's such a touching story that it's really weird, Alisan is 25 now . Every time I watch a movie, someone is always young and the movie comes out a year after it is shot. When you look at it, you learn how old the person is in the movie that really is. You can go from one age to another. following. Like Harry Potter. This film was also excellent, but Daniel was still about 12 years old in the first film and I was about 11 years old. So how could he spend 12 to 16 years in about 4 years and I'm only 13 years old? I do not know if he's 16 at the moment, I think he's almost 18, but it's a bit weird when we watch a movie and the next, about 4 years ago, and then when they were only one in the last.I am not sure of having a great I am a bit of a computer specialist, but I like doing a lot of things for kids too. I'm very clever like a curly sweat in the movie but one thing I do not like in the movie is when this guy calls the foster home and gets curly brought in I'd kill that guy if he had really done in real life. Well, I will stop writing. I know I write often, but children have a lot of head to go out and if they do not, they will never learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
