The man at home is a real sitcom in every sense of the word. The comedy is about a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O'Sullivan) who finds himself after a raging party and then finds himself at the home of two ladies, Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was held to say goodbye to their former roommate. The obvious ended up happening when he moved in. <br /> <br /> The man of the house was a forerunner of Cooke and Mortimer's TV series, George and Mildred, which featured the 2 characters owners of Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually be the pins of the man of the house with Mildred (the late and regretted Yootha Joyce) getting in particular some of the best lines of the series. Larry (Doug Fisher) was a semi-ordinary character, a useless person who was always on the mess and never came back until he wanted to borrow something (and never give it back). <br /> <br /> The American's did it. a version called the company of three, but it has no chance compared to this much funnier original. Thames took the risk of producing a comedy about a man sharing an apartment with 2 women in a very conservative time, but they should be worried, because the ratings of the time suggest that about 20 million people wanted just look at a good old-fashioned old comedy. inspired casting and a sharp script. What a pity that modern comedy can not reach this high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on the network DVD.
