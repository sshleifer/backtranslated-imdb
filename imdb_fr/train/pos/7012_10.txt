Although a watery, it's really a movie "feel good". All the actors were excellent and Will Smith, as always, does the work and does it well. I could go on, but choose any note on "10" and they said it as well and probably better than me. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I have to include at least 10 lines to post a comment, I would say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was very enjoyable and I can not wait to see her play in many upcoming movies. <br /> And, this movie shows that Will Smith has nothing to prove in terms of his acting abilities.
