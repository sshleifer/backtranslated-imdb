I am surprised that no one has yet mentioned that there are two versions of this same movie. The lion's share of the images in both is identical, but here is where they differ: in one version (the version I have most often seen on television), the group of clerics guarding the bridge is made up of the "Brotherhood Protectors ". , a (fictitious) dissident group of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the Church. In the other version, which I saw only once on television, the clerics who guard the door are described as priests of the official Church, that is to say, the archdiocese of New York (or maybe Brooklyn). In addition, in the previous version, in most relevant scenes, clerics are called "brothers" (and in some scenes you can see where the lips say "Father" so-and-so, but the doubled audio says "Brother" so-and-so In this last version, I think everyone is called "Father". <br /> <br /> Anyway, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partial re -turning of the other scene, with all the scenes of the "Brotherhood of the protector" taken again as "scenes of archdiocese", or conversely (it reminds me of the cut scenes of Raymond Burr in "Godzilla"). I can not imagine that, can anyone enlighten us more about the story behind these two versions of the film?
