This film is not great, but it is a good and enjoyable film. It's like an independent film made from a screenplay. Morgan Freeman essentially plays himself, although the director swears that the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor who goes to a supermarket to research a film to which he has not yet committed. I mean, he finally did the movie and we watch it :) <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue a little too positive for my taste, but refreshing anyway. It's a film that inspires the viewer to look at their own lives and to choose the direction in which to go. A little too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> In summary: a nice little film made in two weeks, with essentially two actors and some extras, focused on dialogue, gives Morgan Freeman a unique look. well :)
