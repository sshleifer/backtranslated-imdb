I saw tons of science fiction from the 70s; some horribly bad, and others thought provoking and really scary. Soylent Green belongs to this last category. Yes, sometimes it's a little campy, and yes, the furniture is good for a crazy laugh, but some of the movie looks terribly presumptuous. Here we have a film, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as something dark, scary and nihilistic. Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are doing much better than The Ten Commandments, and Robinson's assisted suicide scene is terribly prey to Kevorkian and his ilk. Some attitudes are obsolete (can you imagine a filmmaker who moves away from the concept of "women as furniture" in our 90s so politically correct?), But it is rare to find a film of the decade that can really to make think. This is the one I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a big screen presentation, I do not think that the overall scope of this film would receive its due. Check it out.
