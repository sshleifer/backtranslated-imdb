Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity about insects and cinema blends into a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper, and Mrs. Beetle. The rather simple story of a couple of adulterous beetles that both look for stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a short biographer or vitagrapher. Starewicz's story is to use balmy beetles with son straightening their legs in frame-by-frame animation. The story is constructed while Mr. Beetle is filmed without knowing it by a dragonfly of the local nightclub, captured by a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle returns home and finds his wife in the arms of his artist friend, he pursues her angrily, but ends up forgiving her and taking her to a movie. However, Mrs. Beetle soon realizes her husband's infidelities, the film they watch being the jealous sequence of a jealous grasshopper of Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly. Mrs. Beetle strikes Mr. Beetle with his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps across the screen and they both end up in jail after the projector they destroyed catches fire. Insects are placed in humanized environments, such as a house or a nightclub, and have human characteristics such as jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. The insect characters carry briefcases, drive cars and even shoes, but they also wave their antennae and open and close their mandibles like real insects. The novelty of the story does not wear out, even after multiple views, but as fluid as the movements are, the film moves slowly. The action happens with complex details, but the speed and rate of filming are lost. Despite its rhythm, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's first puppet shows and is highly recommended.
