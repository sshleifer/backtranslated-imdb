A sequel to the angels with Dirty Faces in the name only, the angels wash their faces suffers a bit of the usual shenanigans of the Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been treated as a sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for the sake of continuity. <br /> About Ann Sheridan, she's the only real light in this movie. To sum up a snapshot, Ann Sheridan could read a directory for two hours and buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another virtue of this film is the chemistry that unites Ann Sheridan to Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is too far from the bottom. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo, I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
