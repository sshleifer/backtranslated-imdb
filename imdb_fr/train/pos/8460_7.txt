Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate him for introducing me to Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching his predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even G Gundam, I find Wing to be Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: An aspect long retained by Gundam is to have their characters dive into difficulties and reach maturity. This does not happen in the wing. Heero is the best dog at the beginning and he is the best at the end. Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is practically a hero in most of the series. But suddenly, the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has great costumes. The Gundams are super cool, the Epyon being my favorite. I even consider that some of the OZ costume designs are on par with some of Zeon's classic costumes. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: in the end, Wing offers scenes of nice fights, although full of recycled animations, but superficial plots and character development. Nice, but do not move like the previous releases of Gundam.
