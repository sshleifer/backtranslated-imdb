I would even say some nuances of Hitchcock ... it's clearly better than the MMM, which is considered a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans. By the way, did you know that Hall was conceived for the first time as a mystery of murder? Anyway, Woody claims some relevance in the movie comedy with this one. The plot turns out well and tight. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some players are a bit too hasty to give their lines, but stay in the area. Scarlett Johansson plays well in the role of Diane Keaton, and at no time are there uncomfortable moments between her and Woody, much older. Nobody could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman.
