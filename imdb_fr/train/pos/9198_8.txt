B movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First film? Yes. But aesthetically A +. This movie was really bad sound / editing / lighting / game / etc. etc. problems. However, this film has a lot of positives about it. First, the most boring character dies first! Secondly, it is made to be a parodic / funny horror film rated B. The comments our killer made to his victims made me and my friends laugh on the floor. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to take each independent film and expect it to be a masterpiece. Consider it as it should, a bunch of kids just out of high school made their first film. For what it is, just that, it's really good.
