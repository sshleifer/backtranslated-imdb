Walking the tightrope of comedy and drama is one of the most difficult acts of cinema. How do you get bursts of laughter from the misery of others and do not you start feeling bad when it lasts too long? <br /> <br /> Well, this amazing gem will give you great laughs, beautiful scenery and a good buzz too. I particularly like the concept that a history trick has legalized alcohol since the Europeans liked it, and that marijuana was illegal, since "these other races" used it ... without any True doubt and expose a racial aspect to the marijuana laws so openly displayed by people all over the world. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary commentary "DVD Extra" ... two of them actually ... go through the whole film with the two actors, then with the writers. I kept seeing things that I was sure were not in the first film, but then I realized how easy it was to miss a lot of subtle comedy at the first shot. What stupidity! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
