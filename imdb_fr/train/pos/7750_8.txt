Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows as he would sing a DEUS song. Anarchy reigns over a logical and common tension of thoughts. The story of this movie any direction the wind blows. And it can be really refreshing to watch, if you are ready and willing to do it. Viewers who say there is nothing that can keep the stories together are right. Who the hell is this Windman anyway? Still, I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, lively place, and Any Way captures that feeling. It also accounts for stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, addictions, and violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The film is fun, fun and a bit superficial. Barman's screen debut will not have as much impact as his debut in music. In this perspective, some may be disappointed. But again, "The Worst Case Scenario" would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows.
