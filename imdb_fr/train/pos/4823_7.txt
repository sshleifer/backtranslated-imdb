It's a difficult thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress must be majestic and imperious, and on the other hand, she must be vulnerable in a difficult situation and muster the courage and resolve to overcome obstacles, since almost all the films on queens have this basic plot line. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is as radiant as Victoria, but it's not as complete a performance as I'd like, no blame for her. I can not help but think that this is an unprecedented adaptation of Mills & Boon to a darker, more dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. Therefore, Blunt does not have the full range of royal emotions, at least not in its entirety, because she is, you know, young Victoria. To see old Victoria, see Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vall√©e is an interesting director choice for the film. He played for the last time with C.R.A.Z.Y. It was a pretty different movie but I remember it looked beautiful and that's probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this one was from Julian Fellowes and, although I liked his Gosford Park a lot, the story of this movie was a lot less interesting. I quickly lost myself with all the government policy. Maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential decapitation of the monarchy. I say that like that.
