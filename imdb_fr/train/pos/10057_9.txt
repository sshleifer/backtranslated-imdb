I was going to bed with my friend last night, and while brushing her teeth, I reversed the chains until I came across this Chinese film called The King of Masks. At first, I thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, so I started to watch it, then it immediately captured me and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorable. She was such a great actress because she was so small. Maybe the fact that it is in Chinese and that English was nicknamed made it harder for me to say it ... but it really seemed perfectly in characters. I felt so bad for the girl as she tried to please her "boss" but everything turned out to be rotten. lol. Even when she brings him another grandson, just so that he can transmit his art ... it turns out that this kid was kidnapped, so he is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... everything she touches in order to be kind to her grandfather, turns against her. <br /> <br /> Finally, he sees how much love is in him and teaches him the art of masks ... which is so comforting after all the misadventures of the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely a jewel and an originality. <br /> <br /> Scott
