This made for crime what "Not another teen movie" did for the school. I laughed all the way as 2 incompetent gangs fought each other and each other. A subtle comedy using jokes and gags that made me roll. I guess the biggest gag in the movie was that the weather never seemed to get going, leaving the characters trapped in the '30s.
