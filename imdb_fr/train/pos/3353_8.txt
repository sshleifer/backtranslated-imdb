This film makes a strong comment on the Italian people of the time. The use of mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is charming and I can not fail to mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I like both of them. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and so natural that you can wonder if the camera is really present or not. The husband, in his brief role, is also very well described as the fascist Italian who commands his wife and children but, in his own way, a loving father. The first scenes with Hitler on Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and really place the film in the story. I loved the movie and I also agree that it's funny, it's not better known.
