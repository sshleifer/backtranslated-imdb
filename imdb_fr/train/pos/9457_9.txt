How can you sum up how good are you feeling, touching and touching this movie ?? For several weeks, this DVD jumped to my eyes every time I went to the store. After seeing Steve Carrell in a few movies, I did not want to blur my thoughts about him. So I resisted and resisted until finally I caught it with a 'What is hell!' attitude! And how surprised I was! I just wish I bought it earlier. After looking at her three times in two days, I'm still smiling at the way the portrait of a widower with three daughters aspires to what has been missing since the death of his beloved wife intriguing woman, who charms her in such a way A deep and interesting way (dare I say bookish?) throws a different light on the life that makes her understand that she is what he was looking for. <br /> <br /> The difficulty of this woman being the daughter of her brother complicates questions - which portray Dan soundly comic and with heartfelt sorrow, seeing his "special someone" bring so much pleasure and pleasure in the family home as well as the life of his brother. You really start to feel sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> Then, when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper, it's the turning point in Marie's estimation of Mary! The look she gives him when he repeats his comment, about not loving Ruthie - the pure green-eyed monster! Trigger an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the most successful as Dan begins to relax in the face of Mary. <br /> <br /> Other heartbreaking scenes begin: Dan returns from the book and fishing store, confronting his brothers. to describe what just happened .... when Dan's face falls, he takes a deep breath} <br /> <br /> His youngest daughter, Lilly, makes her gift by celebrating their love for Suzanne, his late wife, A warm little warmth and a small breath of air as Dan realizes what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays the guitar and sings at the Talent Show ..., his voice breaks as he picks up the song. ... an absolute jewel! <br /> <br /> The acceptance of what happens late in the film by his daughters ... all three love their father and want to see him happy, do not let him deny his love for Mary; Dan's desperation not to let his daughters down because he is their rock, their stronghold ... and tell him more than that in a few words. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on but I'll leave it for now - maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future .... but I'll end by saying .. .. <br /> <br /> .... if you want to watch a movie it's so good, with nuances of comedy to lighten the drama, which never feels forced nor rude, which is presented as a true portrait of a man discovering a new life - not only with a woman but also with her extended family, so look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for a cinematic experience as well rendered with a score of Sondre Lerche, which will take you in an intimate way, without ever disturbing you, performances of the actors. I can not wait to see that again !!
