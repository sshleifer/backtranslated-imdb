Sisters In Law is composed of the same directors of the fascinating "Divorce, Iranian style", which is quite curious and is as faithful as it was stated, as we had a glimpse of the Divorce Court in Iran. Now they have turned to Cameroon's judicial system in Africa. The great thing about this court is that 2 magistrates are women, which is unusual for a country like this. Anyway, they deal with a lot of men accustomed to coping with women, but this film is remarkable in that it seems that women have made great progress in society, with legal divorce and the rights of recognized women. Judges often blame men for behaving primitively in these difficult times. This does not mean that women who appear in court receive milder treatment. One of the film's main goals is a case of child abuse committed by an aunt. The judges do not waste time attacking the woman furiously. And who said that justice was no longer served? With these 2 behind the bench. They often apply maximum sentences! Yes! Go, girl!
