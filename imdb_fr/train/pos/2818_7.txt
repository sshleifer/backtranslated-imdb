"Dragonlord" sees Chan resume his role as "Dragon" of "The Young Master". However, not much has been reported from the first film. "Tiger", his older brother, is nowhere to be found; neither the Marshall, nor his daughter nor his son were superbly interpreted by Yuen Biao in the original film. Dragon, however, has the same master - presumably all the other students have moved on. (Dragon's sloth in training is strongly described in this film, so maybe he is still studying!) <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Young Master In Love", this film sees Dragon (at least for the first sixty minutes) a villager girl of various idiotic ways and geniuses. His rival for his affection is his friend (inappropriately named "Cowboy"), played comically by long-time member of the Chan Stunt team, Mars. We see various scenes where their stupid projects turn against us. This is one of those scenes in which we find (thankfully) "Dragon" above his head. <br /> <br /> This film is known to have missed the expectations of the counter. That said, I'm sure the expectations were high, and I think this film has never had a fair trial based on its own merits. But even when I try to do that, I always feel that there is a problem with the movie. This seems pretty hazy, sometimes hasty, and I think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as Chan's other work of that period. <br /> <br /> What really saves the film is the final sequence. As in "The Young Master", there is a fantastic final roll that is filled with incredibly exhausting action - you really feel every shot. And again, Chan faces the same rival of "The Young Master" (is it the same character?), And the timing and energy here are brilliant. Chan's style of using every last element of his environment to defeat his opponent - and not just relying on his pure physical abilities - is as evident here as anywhere else. The barn in which they fight is full of little gags and clever improvisations. This is a highlight of the film and one of Chan's incredible careers. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to see the previous one before seeing "Dragonlord", it could even ask more questions than he hoped to answer. But it must be said that the original film is the top film, and "Dragonlord", focused on hunting girls and team sports, seems confusing. Fortunately, the few fight scenes he offers (plus a fantastic scene of shuttles) make him a must-see film in this genre.
