The haunted world of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a very good documentary. Aesthetically, it is dull and cheap, the people who work there are on tangents that make it very vague and consistent, but it adds to its charm. I say that because it's a strange, strange-looking documentary that has made weird images and surrounded ourselves with strange people, so there's no other way to document life and career. of the man and his team of marginals. There are some glimpses of Wood's understanding of engineering and inefficiency, and the representation of these two qualities is to the credit of the authenticity of the documentary. Overall, fans of Wood and cinema in general are worth a look, but do not expect a brilliant shine. Expect a documentary made after Wood's heart.
