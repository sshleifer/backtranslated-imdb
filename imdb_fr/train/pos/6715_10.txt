I loved watching "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" on Friday night on ABC's TGIF. I think it was one of the best gigs on TGIF. My friends and I used to meet every Friday just to watch this show and we did not miss any episodes. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was adorable and so funny. I also loved Sabrina's boyfriend, Harvey. He was hot. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina through the mirror" and "Hilda and Zelda: adolescence". These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really miss this show. I hope that one day ABC will bring it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
