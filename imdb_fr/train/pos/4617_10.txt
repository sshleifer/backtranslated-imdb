I've been a fan of Jennifer Connelly since Phenomena, and after hearing about seven minutes in heaven, I saw her as soon as I could. The movie is not just a comedy if you think that many of these things have been lived by most of us and that we are currently living. The film was great, directed by phenomenal jennifer connelly, he captivated my attention that this movie was terrifyingly written and it's a good deal that I loved and watched again and again and for those who like to laugh or love jennifer you connelly that you can not differ from seeing this movie !!!!
