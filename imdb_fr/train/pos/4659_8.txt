Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, it could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at her best and for Maggie's fans, it's a pleasure to see her in her early days, matching Ustinov every step of the way. For the English in their fifties (and I'm in this slice), it's always fun to see and hear the sounds of Swinging Sixties, and although this film spends a lot of time in the office, it contains a lot of red buses Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a delicious shot under the micro-skirt of a waitress, like the one England has never seen in public places. As an I.T. engineer, I know that hacking tips are laughable, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. Nor the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.
