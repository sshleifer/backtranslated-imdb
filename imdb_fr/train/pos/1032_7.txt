A message movie, but pretty good. Excellent distribution, from top to bottom. Interesting in this plot of Bette Davis is essentially a story back! Extremely negative critics (name on the screenplay or playwright, associating it with extremely negative comments about "Angles in America," etc.) oppose the film being too pretentious about Germany during the Second World War. That, then, is a little too sophisticated understanding of morality for me. <br /> <br /> Theatrical and cinematic, the game styles change over time and of course, 70 years later, this film will not be shot here. Yes, Casablanca is a better film (I suppose), but although this film was made the same year and both have Nazis, Casablanca is above all a love story. The love story in this movie is the second place in the spy plot - more of a thriller. Both have quite a few rather tacky accents and wonderful actors. Children are a little tedious and could have been edited
