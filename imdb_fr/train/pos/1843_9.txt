This drama is different from Sex and the City, where women drink a few drinks and share their sexual encounters. It's a lot more personal and people can understand. It's a lot more engaging and emotional to a new level than other dramas centered on women and their lives like "Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle ...." <br /> <br /> Dr. Katie Roden is a psychologist with an obscure secret. She seems much more depressed and guilty than the rest of her three friends. She faces the death of her former lover who was his patient while tackling the advances of his son. Her dark clothes and her cold, empty house convey her emotions very well. <br /> <br /> Trudi Malloy, a widow, is fighting to "let go" of her husband who died on September 11th. And when a beautiful stranger, Richard shows an interest in her, she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest her to go back to dating work. The ridiculous and embarrassing court scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny! It is interesting to note that Richard is asking her to leave the day her September 11th council will bring her millions of dollars for the death of her husband. Let's see what his intentions are. <br /> <br /> Siobhan Dillon, a lawyer is fed up The tactics of her husband's love, which is only to make the baby (because they have trouble conceiving), falls quickly for his colleague who offers her "services" a little too willingly and she does not hesitate long! interesting to see if she will continue her affair or her relationship with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey) Jessica, a real estate business woman is single and straight, until she organizes a lesbian marriage and has a connection with one of them. Her character appears as a daring and provocative woman who, before her lesbian encounter, had sex with a "married man", her colleague. Let's see where his character ventures .... <br /> <br /> The beauty of this drama lies in the fact that we see four totally different women with different scenarios, whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. It is also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to be "safe"!
