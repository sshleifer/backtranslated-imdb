Some spoilers If you are a big fan of horror movies, then you will know that Halloween has paved the way for many slasher movies. Often imitated, never duplicated, this film is a true horror classic and is certainly one of the scariest films of all time, if not the scariest. <br /> <br /> I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (do not ask me why). Honestly, I saw the other 7 movies before this one, that's what happened. But I must say that this one wins all the others. It's really scary, and seeing Michael come out from behind a bush or walk in the dark is cold in the back. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a guy and leans his head to the side. This is one of the scariest images in the film's history. <br /> <br /> Subsequent slashers, such as Friday the 13th, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than any F13 movie. Michael Myers is a scary villain because he's realistic, you can imagine a crazy guy like him killing people. I admit that this film gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> What's great about this movie is that it does not rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure terror. It is unfortunate that the last films in the series were influenced by this one, because it is also a good example of a spectacular slasher movie.
