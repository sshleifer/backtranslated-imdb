It was a great movie! Although there were only 15 people including myself, it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mother even appreciated. There were two middle aged women and a 20 year old woman and they seemed to enjoy it. I like the part where Corky and Ned like Nancy and stuff her adorable lol. And when she gets her roadster and Ned will be there. Yes, it was a good movie, even though people have underestimated it lol. Go see it I bet you will enjoy it !! I really enjoyed it and my friend too. <br /> <br /> People were so tough with this movie and they did not even see it. I bet next time they will give the film and the actresses a chance. They all did a great job in my opinion. But if you have young children, it's still appropriate. I will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too.
