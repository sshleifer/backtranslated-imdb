When this film was released for the first time, my father brought it home. We were amazed. It was so different from everything we had seen before. Last night, I was looking for a particular movie and I found 'The Mind's Eye'. The box is falling apart and I'm surprised the band is still working! Although these are not "Finding Nemo" quality graphics, they are still very good. They should resell it because it is a benchmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended!
