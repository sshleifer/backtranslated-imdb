I do not have words to describe the quality of this film. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could have written such a description of the days of the score. The film haunted me for several days. <br /> <br /> Urmila played the role of his life in this film. She put life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai did no less play her role in the role of Rashid. It's hard to imagine anyone other than those two playing Puroo and Rashid. The Punjabi costumes seemed so natural to Urmila and Manoj looked like a Punjabi Mussalmaan. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand were doing a fabulous job. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some scenes do not escape you. When Puroo meets Lajjo for the first time, it makes you cry. The highlight is just killer. I was expecting a tragic end, but fortunately the end was magnificent. <br /> <br /> This film is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. Do not miss.
