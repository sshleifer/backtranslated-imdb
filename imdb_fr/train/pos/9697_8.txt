It's a very comforting family film. It also has great animal training and a "game" (if you can call it that) (just think of the dog in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" ... it was just a bad workout) . The story of Paulie is extremely well done, well reproduced and, in general, the characters are also very elaborate. Nothing more to say if it is a BIG MOVIE! <br /> <br /> My notes: history 8.5 / 10, role-play 7.5 / 10, animals + FX 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8/10. <br /> My overall rating: 8/10 - GREAT FAMILY FILM AND VERY GOOD TO SEE!
