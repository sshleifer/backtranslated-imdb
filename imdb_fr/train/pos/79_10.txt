I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's a shame that Lydia Reed decided to be forgotten and not to appear. She was excellent in the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was great, as was Tony Martínez. I liked it when he called Amos Señor Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6. If only there would be more TV shows like this, everything would be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. May God bless all the deceased members of the cast and please, Llydia Reed, make yourself known to the public again. You are loved and respected. True McCoys will live forever.
