Good for an evening of entertainment - but the plot was not convincing. The bond between Garrison and the First Lady was unreal and without passion. the president was a cut cardboard. And who were the real bad guys anyway? Nothing has been developed or explained sufficiently. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved. The wicked were nameless and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to make history a reality: the pursuit and the confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both amazing in their roles. Basinger was totally lacking in character and no way to make Longoria a secret service agent. It could have been a very good movie, but he missed his way, with too many unanswered questions. Disappointing overall despite some very good scenes. And did they use the 'West Wing' set for the White House scenes? - I was still expecting CJ or Charlie to appear!
