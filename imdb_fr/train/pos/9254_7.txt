no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserves a rating below 5 here. It's a mediocre version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight Run, with the exception of the prisoner who is transported here, it's the very easy, Mrs. Eleniak. Tom Berenger plays another gruff military guy, a maverick and William Mcnamara plays his debutant on the verge of being well liberated. The plot at first glance is absurd because I have lost count of the number of times Eleniak should have and could have escaped, but it's an entertaining and entertaining film, and all the actors mentioned above maintain the film in motion. It's not really a family film because there are some scenes of nudity with eleniak but it's much better than some of the other blunders that came out at that time.
