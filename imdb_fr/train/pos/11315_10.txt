Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. The great Italian directors of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium, but it was Luchino Visconti, a man of vision, who dared to bring a film as to show what he was capable of doing. He clearly shows his genius from the beginning of his brilliant career with "Ossessione", a film based on "The postman always rings twice" by James Cain, which was later directed by Hollywood, but this version is derisory compared to what that Visconti realized in the film. . Luchino Visconti and his on-screen contributors included Alberto Moravia, an uncredited man who knew the effects of passion on human beings. <br /> <br /> The film was well preserved in the DVD format we recently watched. The film is a must for all serious film fans because we can see how Visconti's vision translated the text into a film that sounds just plausibly, which was missing from the American version. <br /> <br /> film is the intensity that the director draws from his main actors. The beautiful Clara Calamai does an amazing job as Giovanna, the woman who married an older man, but when Gino appears in her life, all she wants is to get rid of that man who gave her a chance in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations of Ms. Calamai's achievements in Italian cinema. The last sequence of the film shows Ms. Calamai at its best in the ironic twist that serves as moral redemption for the monstrous crime that has been committed. <br /> <br /> Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti, one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino, the fleshy man who awakens the obsessive passion of Giovanna. Gino is the ideal man for Giovanna, which Mr. Girotti projects with unprecedented ease and sophistication on the screen. Mr. Girotti makes the living man in a performance that seems so easy, but with another actor, it might not have been so obvious. Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe, the older man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character sounds truer than his American counterpart, where he is more seen as a jester. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic aspect that was the preference of the Italian directors of the time. The original musical score of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes Bizet and Verdi tunes that fit in well with the context of the film. <br /> <br /> "Ossessione" is a film to cherish because we see a great Luchino Visconti at the top of his form.
