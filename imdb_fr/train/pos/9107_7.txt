Several stories are interwoven here around different female characters. The shoes they wear are an indication of their troubled lives. All are transformed at the end of the film. Adela (Antonia San Juan) runs a brothel; His daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is delayed and has a limited life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a footwear designer struggling with problems and losing her boyfriend. Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) has lost her husband and is now raising the children of her deceased ex-wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a rich and bored woman. <br /> <br /> Other characters are used to connect the five main female characters. In the story, everything is not lost in the beginning: some connections are established surprisingly late in the film, which adds to the experience. The theme of the shoe is pushed to the extreme: for example, when Leire, a shoe designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes, she breaks one of his heels. <br /> <br /> By editing small connections are made between scenes. A phone rings, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. are used to make the connection and make quick cuts. Frequent scenario changes keep it from being boring or reaching the TV level. He is heavily focused on music to set the tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as a backdrop to the stories, and their plans serve to extend the story beyond the characters. Anita, who makes the same walk every day, widens her and restricts the life of the relative calm of her street to the busy main street, which is particularly moving: the visual translation of the restriction of space is well done. As in most Spanish films, many stories are done visually, using soap-like stories as a backdrop. There is a poetic end somewhat romantic and sentimental, but still beautiful. <br /> <br /> As Ramón Salazar is too much in love with his own material, he is too long. Some scenes are kitschy and soap-wise, including acting (Adela's love life, Isabel's doctor). The shoe theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because its structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically competent, but a bit mechanical. It has the ability to visually translate emotions and atmosphere. After seeing this, you are inclined to immediately move to the new city-movie: Madrid.
