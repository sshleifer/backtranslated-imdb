"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG-1 through a device called Stargate and all the surprises that await it on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> After seeing this series sporadically for 10 years after watching an episode, I did not know how great this series would be. My old impression was that the series was excellent, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a sci-fi series, it's one of the most successful, interesting, longest and most exciting sci-fi movies ever produced. And why? Because it works on an incredible premise. <br /> <br /> The value of this series far exceeds that of the film on which it is based and I think it is a very good example of what television, as a media, with a proper premise , is able to provide something that does not work on film time limitation. The feeling of familiarity created by a long series, watching the characters and their circumstances evolve over time is amazing and adds to the ability to suspend disbelief. All this is the result of fantastic writings and the dedication of all members of the show team. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" continued to offer great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it left room for very different periods of the show: <br /> <br /> - The first seasons, maybe until the 4th / 5th, were much more focused on the exploration of different planets and situations, maintaining the episodes without no connection between them if it was for the always looming threat Goaul'd. <br /> <br /> - From July 5th to 7th, more and more episodes have been devoted to the fight against Goaul'd and the prevention of attacks on the Earth. After this season, planetary exploration was almost an excuse to place sg-1 in a place in conflict with Goaul'd / replicator / ori <br /> <br /> - The 8th season is probably the most mixed. There is a stream of episodes that includes minor land issues in which the stargate is barely mentioned, but the latest episodes present great moments of replication. <br /> <br /> - The 9th and 10th are traveling together because they have the same new enemy and not Jack O'Neil. These are both good sequels, although the first episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, as they seem little more than SG-1 and human / Jaffa lose the battle after the battle against the Ori. <br /> <br /> Essentially, after season 7, exploration was pushed back into the background, which was in many ways a shame, because of the potential and mystery of each planet (episode) present; on the other hand, this has given rise to so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change in nature of the series has continued and showed how bold and daring the scriptwriters were. to have a high quality end that puts him well in rest, the feeling that I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the story of the show had a lot to offer. A last season returning to the beginning of the series was very feasible and would have been welcome, but ultimately things are what they are. <br /> <br /> Finally, because I liked everything, it's a bit difficult to find that it ends. The big picture, however, that drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the last 10 years, is a beauty show and truly reflects the dedication of the team, of these remarkable actors and characters we will remember always. as a collective under the name of SG-1.
