Shintaro Katsu, best known for Zat√¥ichi's films, is featured again in this third and last film by Kenji Misumi (best known for "Lone Wolf and Cub"), in the Hanzo saga "The Razor" Itami, featuring the crazy ninjas in action, raping "ghosts" and discovering dubious treasure activities of the shogunate. Hanzo's "plot" was a bit bland and repetitive. What was once novel in the first film was no more. Fortunately, this one was better than the second thank you for having more humor. I'm glad they choose to stop at the only trilogy (I'm watching you Lucas) <br /> <br /> My note: B <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Simple trailers for Hanzo the Razor 3 movies <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima unleashes both tits, Mako Midori just left her on her left
