To say that a movie is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am quite willing to watch a depressing movie if there is a point to make and this one certainly has one. This is the often heartbreaking story of a Chinese and his family, who live many years of hardship and plenty. BUT, I have to warn you that this could be the most depressing film out of Hollywood in the 1930s, because peasant life in China was hard to say the least. Prepare to watch footage of famine, death, and illness. <br /> <br /> The only negative point, apart from the persistent tone of misery, is that Paul Muni is the main actor. While he was an exceptionally talented man, it is a shame that Hollywood has always encouraged people of European descent to play the leading Asian role during this period. If you pay attention, it is quite obvious that Muni is wrong for the role.
