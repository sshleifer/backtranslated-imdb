It's the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> It may be because I live a few kilometers from the village where the story unfolds and I know how things are going in this region of Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! He criticizes and honors both Dalarna's lifestyle and the producer wants people who watch the film to be more open-minded and more concerned about your closest friends and family. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or in another country), you will probably recognize a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
