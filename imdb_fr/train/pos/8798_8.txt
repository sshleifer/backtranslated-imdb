First and foremost, I will not praise IÃ±arritu's short film, even though I'm Mexican and proud of its success in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I find that most critics focus on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a subtle bottom line that surrounds the entire compilation and that it may not be so nice for Americans. (Although this was not the main focus of the producers) <br /> <br /> The story I'm talking about is that most of the shorts do not show the suffering that the WASP people have suffered because of the terrorist attack of September 11, but the suffering of others. <br /> <br /> Do you need proof of what I say? In the short film on Bosnia, the message is: "You are crying because of the people who died in the towers, but we (the others = Eastern Europeans) have been crying for a long time for the crimes committed against our women and no one pays attention to us, as everyone did to you ". <br /> <br /> Even if the story of Burkina Fasso is more in the comedy, there is the same thought: "You are angry because Osama bin Laden hit you in an evil But we (the others = Africans) should be more angry because our people have been dying of hunger, poverty and AIDS for a long time, and no one is paying attention to us as everyone has done. " <br /> <br /> Watch now Sean Penn's short film: The Fall of the Twin Towers makes a lonely (and insane) man happy. So the message is that power and greed (symbolized by the towers) must fall to allow people to see the sun rise and the flowers blossom? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom line was proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is almost subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, Ken Loach (very well known for his anti-capitalist ideology) is a lot clearer and shameless when he goes to the point: "You are angry because your country was attacked by evil forces but we (the Others = Latin Americans) suffered at a similar date something worse and no one remembers our grief as the whole world did it to you "It's as if the creator of this project wanted tell Americans: "You see now, America? You are not the only ones to be victims of the violence in the world, you are not alone in your pain and, by the way, we (the others = non-Americans) have suffered much more than you have for a long time, so we stand with you in your pain ... and, by the way, we're sorry, because you've tasted your own medicine "Only short films Mexican and French have shown compassion and sympathy for the American people; the others are like a slap for the American state, it is not equal to the American people.
