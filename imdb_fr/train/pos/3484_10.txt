It's just the best movie of all time! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw her in the early 70's, as soon as she appeared on Bulgarian television, and I immediately loved it (I was 14 at the time). 25 years later, I bought it on a videotape and it was released a few months ago on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I live with this movie already 35 years old, as well as all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw him for the first time, and he loved him immediately too (and it's the generation that grew up watching practically only Hollywood movies and neither speaking nor understanding Russian. at all!). What makes this Danelia masterpiece so special? It's hard to say how difficult it is to describe beauty ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time. I do not remember any other film of this kind, no matter how much it cost or how fantastic was the distribution ... Hat, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
