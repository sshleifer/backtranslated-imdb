I enjoyed this movie. It was light, delicious and very colorful. You can see that MGM was showing Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this movie. Every scene is packed. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a marvel. He has so much talent. The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last part of the film, the big dance sequence, is very impressive. Gershwin's music is what makes this film very special. Few American composers have had a better gift for the melody. I really like Gershwin's music. It's enchanting. Ira Gershwin is certainly one of the greatest lyric writers. He is so spiritual and charming. It was a very entertaining film.
