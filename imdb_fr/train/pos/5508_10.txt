We are in 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, Cuban citizen for five years, disappears from the surface of the Earth. Fidel Castro says he is sad, announcing that he is probably dead. In fact, he left Cuba will move to Bolivia to live a supposed identity. While living in La Paz, Guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt bourgeois government. Again, Steven Soderberg picks up where "Che: Part One" ends (only better this time). The pace is more focused, the acting is still delicate (including a trick played by Benecio Del Toro, looking sickly, like Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it is probably better to see both films to get the true story of Guevara and what kind of man he was (I had the rare opportunity to see both films during a screening - - long-term conversation!). As in "Che-Part 1: The Argentina", this movie has no MPAA rating, but contains enough salty language and violence to take it easily.
