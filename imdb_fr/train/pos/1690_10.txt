I found memorable quotes looking for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old person 1: You know, I remember the first time they played this thing. Elderly 2: You remember pterodactyls. Elderly 1: And I remember you fell in love with this hook line and your turntable. Older Person 2: Oh, I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Old lady: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head and took soldiers with you to fight Martians. <br /> <br /> Elderly 2: You are not dead yet?
