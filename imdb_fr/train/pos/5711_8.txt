In The Million, Ren√© Clair, one of the great directors and pioneers of the cinema, has created a jewel of light comedy that, despite its lightness, is an innovative and technically brilliant film that has clearly influenced the following filmmakers, such as Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian. Intrigue, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a lottery lottery but has to frantically search for the missing ticket throughout the city, is really only a way to support a series of scenes Wondrously witty humorous performances performed in a dreamlike world of the director's imagination. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive aspects of this film is that, even if it takes place in the heart of Paris and includes nothing impossible, it allows to create an atmosphere of fairy tale. fairy / sustained fantasy, in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they speak, or that a fight on a stolen jacket takes the form of a football match. Another memorable element is that The Million includes what is perhaps the funniest opera ever staged (O this blonde braided soprano! "I laugh, ha! Ha!") Another delight is the cast: Clear brought together a group of different characters, each illustrating with a deadly satirical precision a bourgeois French "type", so that the film gives the impression of giving life to a series of Daumier engravings. <br /> <br /> Hilarity takes little time. I thought that the characters were not as attractive as possible in a light comedy (as in many Lubitsch films, for example). For these reasons, I refrained from giving him the highest rating. But these small evils should not distract from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? By all means. Highly recommended if you want a classic and influential movie or just a fun comedy.
