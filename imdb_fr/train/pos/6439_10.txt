I went to see this film twice a week in one week and I can summarize it in one word (which I do not normally use lightly): Wonderful! In my opinion, the best movie of all time. Who deserves the Oscars and other awards otherwise this Swedish crew who created the cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when all that is said (and left unsaid) throughout the history is gathered? Just as the character of Daniel Dareus evokes so much feelings and feelings long repressed in the people around him, the film does the same with the spectators: you leave your head in a boil and your heart full. Great thing! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life," think maybe you feel after a sumptuous experience like in heaven: happy, satisfied, fulfilled. To say it with Mrs Dalloway of Virginia Woolf: "Such moments are enough".
