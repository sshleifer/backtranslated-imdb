Romantic comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man she is comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls in love with her stubborn and angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The scenario is very clear, with countless beautiful lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (I was told) are perfect, and the cinematography is beautiful. New York has never been so beautiful on the screen. A must-see for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they are both fantastic and deserve the Oscars they have earned. A nice, funny movie. A must see!
