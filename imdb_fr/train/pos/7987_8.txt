Man on Fire was hot. I love a classic revenge tale of good old and what better revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl. <br /> <br /> The writers did a great job in this movie building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so that the viewer understands and really feels Creasy's drive to save Pita . It was also good that Creasy was not a chorus boy trying to rescue Pita through the "proper" ways, but instead used tactics of torture and street control. Some may say that torture is bad no matter, and you may be right, but when you see the pain Creasy is going through because of the loss of Pita and the passion he has for recovering it, you can not help yourself. with Creasy and shoot him to be even more ruthless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to treat the various criminal gangsters and criminals and knew it. <br /> <br /> Creasy's quest ends with Pita returning to her mother and Creasy's death in the villain's vehicle. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, it even improved it by showing that Creasy was ready to die to recover Pita. His death was noble indeed. <br /> <br /> Denzel does a great job, just like the writers. This film deserves good grades because it was really a good movie.
