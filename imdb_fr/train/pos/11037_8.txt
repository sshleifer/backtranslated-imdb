Now, I know that French prisoners will probably not have read Lovecraft (which proves that his writings should be taught at school, perhaps as a separate subject), but how did they think that something looks like "ftagn yog sototh" could eventually lead to any good? <br /> <br /> The film takes place in a prison where four very improbable cellmates fall on a magic book that can, if read well, take them out. As the prisons moved in, the cell was totally unrealistic, so it made it difficult to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves rather slowly, which can annoy people. But other than that, it's a great sense of horror, mixing "Sartre's hell" with a Lovecraft / Barker-type story and doing pretty well. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: take the time to look at this. It means not doing it when you're about to go to work, sleep or do something else. It's a movie that works better if you're immersed in it. Lessons to learn: yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
