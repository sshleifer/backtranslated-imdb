This story is beautifully interpreted. It is both sad and comforting to discover a girl's journey and where she comes from and where she is going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her father and mother were killed in a car accident. Since she wears the label "baby miracle", she is dyslexic and finds life a little hard. His discoveries along the way affect his loved ones. His relations with his guardian and the ex-boyfriend of his guardian are treated with great delicacy and sensitivity. The whole distribution is authentic, three-dimensional and credible. Installed around a fishing canning factory in a small Australian city, this soft and warm erotic film gives you a pleasant sensation when the credits are closed. After reading some of the other rather superficial comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly chosen and extremely sexy. No, it's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he's not attractive.
