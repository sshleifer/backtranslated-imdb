My 20-year-old groovadelic pals and I can not get enough of this awesome Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent this DVD, but I can not find it. Too bad, because I'm sure the features would be "extra special" !! :) We all highly recommend this super cool flickerino comedy for a gallant date, or even for a cozy evening at home! This would also be the type of snoring movie to watch with your cat, or even hold a party-themed party, just like the one in the movie that Parker, adorable, hugging and compressible, goes to. end. Oh, and be on the lookout for a startling surprise ending and HILAIRE ... stand aside, The Sixth Sense, you've just been surpassed by a much more radical movie! Sorry, no offense, just call like that! Comedy is no better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Yours sincerely, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
