Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie, especially considering the bad publicity on its first release. Ben Affleck is funny as an odious millionaire who pays the family who occupies his childhood home to be his family for Christmas. He then makes the family crazy with an excess of indifference for the joy of Christmas. I have not been a Ben Affleck fan in the past (although I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he plays well in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as a daughter of the family who does not support the character of Affleck at the beginning. Of course, you can see where this film is going, but you do not care. Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie because it's funnier than a lot of Christmas movies.
