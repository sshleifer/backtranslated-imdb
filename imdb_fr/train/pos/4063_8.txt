Castle in the sky is without a doubt a film by Hayao Miyazaki. After seeing it for the first time, I'm happy to say that it does not disappoint. On the contrary, you have it for your time, which means (as far as Miyazaki's films are concerned), it's nothing short of excellent! <br /> <br /> Produced at the beginning of his film career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trademarks in his latest films. Strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow due to external circumstances, helped with very interesting (and sometimes attractive) support characters. And of course, the usual battle of nature against civilization, flying machines (in abundance !!), beautiful painted landscapes? but alas, no pigs (at least, I noticed it, I only saw it once). Nevertheless, Miyazaki had already made her theater debut two years earlier, with Nausic√£a, a dress rehearsal of Princess Mononoke, her magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is a little out of those two, with a sweet action wrapped up the first 30 minutes, which resembles his television series Conan and his episodes directed by Meitantei Holmes. Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, is featured here by Pazu, a young boy who works in a small mining town in the countryside. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is determined to help her discover where she comes from, while fleeing the army and a gang of pirates. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at its best. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very spiritually reminiscent of Spirited Away (or vice versa, because Castle in the sky was first produced), and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi, the composer begins with a score very light. it becomes more and more complex and beautiful as the plot progresses! <br /> <br /> A note to English dubbing, with a good rendition of the two main stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at this point in her career), and head over to Mark Hamil in the role of Muska, in compensation for a ravenous but devilish villain! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one people!
