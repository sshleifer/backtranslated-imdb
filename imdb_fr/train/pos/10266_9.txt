House of Games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play an important role. A psychologist offers to help a patient who has gambling debts and gets caught in the game. <br /> <br /> Have you ever felt fascination with something that was both dangerous and false? Look what happens if you continue this desire and go all the way. Sit on the edge of your chair while the rogues are trapped and the victims turn into assailants. You never know who exactly is who in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is both a quality and a disadvantage of the script. At the end of the film, you have the impression that the story lacks a bit of coherence. But all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the best games on gambling.
