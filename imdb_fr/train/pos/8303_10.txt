This movie literally has all the clich√©s of an action movie and all work to its advantage. Directly shot from Lethal Weapon, Gary Busey tells, films and laughs through this film with such indiscriminate abandonment that he can not help but amuse and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine guns, grenades and ice cream vans. If there are not enough reasons to watch this movie, why not the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, this movie will probably not please you.
