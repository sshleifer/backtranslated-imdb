As a fan of deepening the phenomenon of shootings in schools, this film has taken an interesting approach and different from the idea. Presented as a series of video recordings made by the two men in difficulty (I can not speak of people who kill boys or teenagers), the months of preparation leading to day zero (the code name of the day where they will attack), the film tries to present the situation of the opposite end of the pistol. He seems intent on describing the suffering they are experiencing while focusing on literal preparation. The problem is that few emotions are delivered directly. The only point where the emotion became invasive was the end, as expected. But to come to this point, it's never really clear why they're planning this. We are told the obligatory story that they made fun of him, but the film also seems to contradict that. Without ruining the film, it's easy to say that it was a great attempt and that his intentions were just as good, but failed because of a sloppy film making. All the staging is amateur, to advance the concept of home video, but the story and continuity are weak. The film seems to want the public to decide a lot, but also fails to provide the information for such an event. The end is abrupt and does not give the impression of finishing all that the film has begun.
