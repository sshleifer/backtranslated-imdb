SPOILERS THROUGH: <br /> <br /> I am really a minority on this film, but I liked this movie. It's not a classic, but it's really an adventure driven by an adrenaline rush. I really thought it was worth at least 7. <br /> <br /> Maybe I liked that, it's because I did not see the original. Something tells me that with a movie like this, it's the strongest of fans. people who have not seen the original version and therefore have little to compare. It was not a masterpiece, but I had a lot and it made me want to see the original. <br /> <br /> There are some aspects that I like. One was Kowalkski's cast. Viggo Mortenson was superb and brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since most of the film fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be great and he was. It was a very good role for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point is the fact that it's made for television. I did not know it was the case when I watched him. It really looked like an important movie and I never thought it was a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found the story very captivating. I'm not one to do action movies but I let myself be carried away. Moreover, it was much more than an action movie in that there was drama, mysticism, a love story, weird people in every way. (I did not even recognize Priest.) And it was touching. It was not a good movie but it is watchable. <br /> <br /> And then there is the end. This gives a powerful punch and if one is involved in the story to this point, it is very difficult not to be pierced at the very end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. The implication was that Kowalkski had survived and although I am very skeptical as to how this would be possible, it is a film and realism is not an ingredient always present in the composition of a film . <br /> <br /> So I must say that I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative way, that I do not like very much, but for some reason, is almost forgivable in this movie . Admittedly, many things were only props for the plot (could the villains be more stereotyped?) But the manufacturers were right, even if they were wrong too. That said, I must admit that I can understand why a big fan of the original version would hate this version because, although I did not see the original version, I saw many original films that I liked to be redone with terrible results. (My great aversion is actually the consequences.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of this quality. <br /> <br /> People compared it to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a road version of "Legends Of The Fall" and "Thelma and Louese"? I felt the contact of the two films (of which I am a fan), but I do not think it is an excellent film. It was better than average for me but far from great. But it was a captivating film, rich in adrenaline and moving, with an excellent cast of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10.
