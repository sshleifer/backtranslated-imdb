It was without a doubt the best of the "Dirty Harry" series. According to the opening credits, you are immersed in a story of revenge that strikes hard and is deeply captivating. Sondra Locke is perfect as a traumatized woman in search of revenge. Eastwood has a lot of sequences "apart" that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry his best for nothing. Loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles, this film rocks and should serve as a standard for detective / action films. This is the only Dirty Harry movie that is raw and devoid of fluff. I can watch this over and over again (okay, not in one sitting) because it's a rewarding thread of "revenge". The pace is fast and many scenes are unforgettable. "Go on, spend my day ... Do you feel lucky, Punk? ..." Eastwood classic, only Eastwood, with its anguished and rubbery expressions and his menacing and threatening voice can do it.
