In the early to mid-1970s, Clifford Irving proposed writing the final biography of Howard Hughes, claiming to have spent months preparing this book and talking to the lonely millionaire. When all this turned out to be false, Irving was accused of perjury and spent several years behind bars (though he still admits his findings were accurate). Flash forward to 20001, several months before September 11, a book titled "Forbidden Love" (published in the United States under the title "Honor Lost: Death and Love in Modern Times in Jordan") by an author unknown until then, Norma Khouri. , a woman from Jordan, who recounted the merciful murder of her best friend, Dalia, because Dalia, of pious Muslim origin, was dating a Christian man. Just like Irving's biography of Hughes, he was revealed as a potential hoax. Australian director Anna Broinowski tries to search the quagmire that consisted of Khouri's attempts to get rid of the lie. Over a period of 104 minutes, the film tries to reveal that Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she just a compulsive liar, with her own agenda / vendetta ?. Interview images of people who know her / know her (including an ex-husband, her publisher, and others) tell their version of the story. It is a well-groomed and well-produced documentary that manages to point fingers at as many potential culprits. Uncategorized, but contains rude language and a reenactment of the scene of the appalling murder, played many times (but nothing as graphic and disturbing as one would see in the latest porn epic of torture, such as Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.
