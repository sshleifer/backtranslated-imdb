My wife and I watched this entire series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. This is not the "complete" story of the Second World War - no library could contain such a story - but it is the best summary of this story. Many details, many personal stories, while keeping an overview. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narration is excellently written and, of course, beautifully given. The interviews concerned all parties, with the exception of Russia, as producers were not allowed to speak to many Russians. It's really worth having this complete program on DVD. We cherish our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer does an excellent job of providing pictures and actions where there are almost no records in the archives: there are almost no convoy movies and sub-battles. marine, for example, but still, the episode on this topic is very well done.
