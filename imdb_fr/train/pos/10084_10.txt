This spectacular movie is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I think it shows 1930s China under the most REAL light ever seen in a film. In many situations, it's heartbreaking to see how hard life has been for the characters. Yet the story and the end are incredibly happy. You really see the depths and heights of human existence in this film. The actors are all perfect, so you feel like you've really entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I just can not recommend this movie enough. It can just change you forever once you've seen it.
