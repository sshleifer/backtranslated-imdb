It's a pretty nasty job in which Bela Lugosi plays the role of a mad scientist (yes, an assistant at Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (it looks like a Greenaway film in Lugosi gives his wife injections of dead wives (why? who knows?) so that his wife can continue to look good .He gets the wives after a clever enough trick with orchids that makes them collapse at the altar After another wife gnaws at the dust, a journalist HAPPENS has just been searching for the scoop and decides to search for a story.He gets all sorts of clues about orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were, and she soon goes to Bela's lair when she meets some kind of funny doctor looking for a false marriage to capture the mad scientist, but it seems like the scientist has a vision. X-ray, al when he foils his plans, Oh no! What's going to happen? I really liked this movie as a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here, her hangers are all very very strange, the story is actually quite unpleasant in some places, which makes her very watchable. A funny little view.
