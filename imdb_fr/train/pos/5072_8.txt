Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only familiar thing in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to international audiences: Canadian history and First Nations culture. <br /> <br /> "Gray Owl" is a light examination of how a man was adopted by the Ojibway of Northern Ontario, learning and preaching the environmentalism of decades before it became politically correct. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. This torture, however, is not always experienced with the dramatic impact it could have. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a film that keeps its audience without violence. He deeply respects the First Nations of Canada and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotypical way. Brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff, but I suppose that is exactly what Lord Attenborough wanted. <br /> <br /> Thank you from a proud Canadian.
