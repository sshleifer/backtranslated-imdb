Kiera Nightly went straight from the P & P series to this action film ... she could hardly have chosen to redo her image in a more spectacular way. A big success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic, she is, once again, "on trial". Just as his warrior wife wearing a bikini in King Arthur was more of a skin than a muscle, it's hard to imagine this delicate setting facing a life of bounty hunters ... but that's exactly what Domino Harvey Moi (Being one of Nightly's biggest fans), I think she wins if she's off. <br /> <br /> Subject Matter ... <br /> <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the postal code for Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, where all the movie stars live. * The most famous film of his father, Domino Harvey, was a Manchu candidate (who appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the release of the film in June 2005, after being arrested for drug trafficking. She had just finished the negotiation so that her music would be included in the movie. * Kiera Knightly refers to the sexuality of Domino Harvey in his interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you find this film a little far-fetched, visit Domino Harvey, because the facts are more amazing than fiction.
