After what was considered Dirty Harry's official trilogy with The Enforcer (1976), it is the last chapter of the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, dirtier and bigger than ever since the original 1971 classic. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry has already killed a psychopathic killer, vigilant police and veteran terrorists from Vietnam. But now he's looking for a new killer, a killer who wants to get his money back, by shooting down his assailants. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact brings a new meaning and a darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan is on a new case of murder that goes to a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped, with her sister, who is traumatized. Ten years later, she wants revenge by shooting down her attackers. At the same time, Callahan is about to worry about his superiors after provoking a heart attack from the mafia boss, who is also pursuing it. So, in order to let the heat dissipate in the city, Harry has to take a vacation in a seaside town, but the raped victim is also in town, as she hunts down her attackers one by one. Harry is investigating and finds the murders very similar, while he is on the killer's trail. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, in my opinion, Impact must be one of my top 10 revenge movies, besides being Dirty Harry's second best film to date, far better than The Enforcer and The Dead Pool united. The sudden impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone with an entertaining value. <br /> <br /> So do you feel lucky, punk?
