For me, it was more an awakening, and the realization that almost everything we see, hear, read and think about almost everything depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of high-level spin-graphs that attempt to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people who have a constitution to which they have freely subscribed will not be influenced by this control of the media or any attempt at misinformation. Once again, this shows that in the end, the needs of the majority of customers will outweigh those of a few. It is also interesting to note that in a country where there is no civil civil war, democracy is not really difficult to implement.
