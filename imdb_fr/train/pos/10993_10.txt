This film is a jewel, because it moves with a soft but firm resolution. <br /> <br /> I warn viewers that although it is portrayed as a corporate spying thriller and Ms. Liu is there, it is evolving with both determination and determination. pace. These are NOT explosions, car chases or flying balls. You must be patient and write down the details here. It's quiet because that's what the main character is. The viewer must MONITOR him and think as this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I will not give spoilers - because it destroys the purpose of watching. The plot corresponds to what you have read in the other publications: a white-collar man, in search of change and adventure, engages for a job of espionage in a company. Just go somewhere to secretly record and transmit internal data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins with a surrealist walk - with a background of corporate disenchantment that wraps itself in suburban paranoia underneath par excellence. <br /> <br /> Then he starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb - and yes, some acts are caricature characters. But they are all in shape, and they are entertaining. And the slight piano rhyme in the background is perfect, as well as the ominous theme to the touch of soft touch: Everything is not right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> And in the end: Everything is not what it seems. <Br /> <br /> Make yourself comfortable and turn off the light to watch this one-- and turn up the sound: This movie wants you to listen.
