Presented as the story of Steve Biko - very well performed by Denzel Washington, as expected - it was actually more about the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> Kline was a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good in his role. <br /> <br /> Attenborough gave this scene the kind of direction you expected, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the genre He's the only one to understand. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was quite competent and did a good job, in what turns out to be the ultimately sad story of a South Africa that is not far from a distant past.
