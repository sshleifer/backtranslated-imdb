The film I found excellent was supposed to relate to romance with a bit of suspense between the two. <br /> <br /> Rob Stewart is a great actor. I do not know why people continue to give him a bad shot. Mel Harris is an excellent actress and for those who think they look too old for Rob, it's only five years. <br /> <br /> Rob played a lead role in his own television series as well as in the television series. Scifi channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat, aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane. <br /> <br /> He has also appeared in many TV movies and is currently producing a TV series Mini. <br /> <br /> They need to give him more leading roles, that's what he does best.
