It's not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it's certainly pretty and observable. It's old fashioned and it works well. Cybill Shepherd in the role of Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who can not overcome the death of her husband. She has a sexy maturity. But I can not say more for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because he is, at best, indeterminate. He may be adequate in the role, but it's not enough. <br /> <br /> However, I have the impression that some characters, including Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough depth. We do not know anything else about them because a few minutes after their release, the story thickens and the writers do not tell us more than what happens. But this problem was saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a sweet freshness to soothe, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that it melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And it turns out that her big dreamy eyes are perfect for already-seen scenes and flashbacks. Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like it, why not try it. <br /> <br />
