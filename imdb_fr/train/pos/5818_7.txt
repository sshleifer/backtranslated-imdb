In fact, this movie has stupid moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci part and the kids, and it's way worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But as a fan of Michael Jackson for almost eleven years, (yeah, that's half of my life, guys!), I can not complain too much. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid it will be worse, if my darling Mike was not the star. But as nobody is other than Mike It's the moonwalker, he must get a 7 out of 10 from me.
