When I heard about the title for the first time, I thought of 'The Simpsons', like so many other commentators, but when I saw the cast, I was completely stunned that so many actors characters are really part of this scene! We first have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the main character, McBain. He is saved from a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp by some of his friends, one of them being Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who divides a CENT DOLLAR BILL with McBain (Vietnamese soldiers are apparently charged with 'money', and tells him he can do it again if he gets in trouble. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Conqueror Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels. in Colombia, trying to get rid of their evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, taxi driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails the mission, Christina asks for help from McBain. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks his good old Vietnamese friends to help him. First, there is Eastland, the stout black guy, played by Steve James of "American Ninja," who also appeared in director James Glickenhaus's previous movie, "The Exterminator," where the real name of the exterminator was also Eastland, coincidence? I do not think so. There are also many other references to The Exterminator, among other things, the most notable being that McBain wears a welder's mask when Christina sees it for the first time while working on a welding machine. . A bridge! <br /> <br /> The other guys from the Vietnamese group are: The rich guy who can afford all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then he there is the doc, Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who does not look like the guy with whom the IMDb is linked, and I have not seen it in other movies, so who knows), and finally, there There's the cop, Gill, who's tired of his unsatisfactory work, he's played by Thomas G. Waites, some of whom may remember The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other big roles, we find Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), as a small drug trafficker who can not get decent work. In addition, Dick Boccelli is the king of drug trafficking who hooked himself into a crane on top of the McBain's roof, almost exactly the same way he clung to a John Eastland meat grinder in EXTERNAL FILM! Now I have not seen Glickenhaus's "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I'm almost ready to bet a half-dollar bill that Boccelli is also suspended in this movie! <br /> <br /> Well, let's go back to the plot of this movie .. they go to Colombia and save the day, yay! But who cares about the plot anyway, the casting is great, and the action scenes are very well done, and you never get bored watching this movie! Highly recommended to all action lovers!
