Although I only started reading the "classics" of literature at 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there is no part of the book that I liked least, but only parts that I enjoyed more. The 1983 television mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was all I wanted. I saw it as a feature film in 2006. "Mr. Rochester 'was very good but I really loved' Jane Eyre 'by Zelah. As for another "Classics" film I saw recently, I was disappointed with the production, direction and dialogue. It was only true to the greed and arrogance of Hollywood. The artistic license of great literary works is nothing less than plagiarism. Using the title after such a license is a fraud. Let the British settle this one (among others). You will not be able to re-read the book without reliving the film with its appropriate context and spirit. Well done BBC.
