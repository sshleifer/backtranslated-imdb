While Hollywood had somehow stagnated in the few years after the Second World War, England developed a very prolific film industry. In "The Man in the White Suit", the inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a costume that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other businesses may now be closing down! How can Sidney handle this and maintain his dignity? This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness had played before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. This is a good overview of the general absurdity of the business world. If you plan to start any type of business, consider watching this movie.
