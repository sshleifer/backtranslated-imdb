I have to admit that the only reason I bought this movie is that I'm a big fan of Gackt and a huge Hyde fan. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that would be, we would say, pleasing to the female eye, but a little old-fashioned story. I mean, the synopsis really sounded there. And now that I have just finished watching it, I feel the need to tell the world its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heartbreaking performances and my eyes are still warm because of the tears that lasted throughout the last half of the film. You are trapped in the story and you really feel interested in the characters in the end. The element of vampirism - which I like very much, but it is very easy to exaggerate or ruin a movie - is subtly mixed in the plot to make it something purely exotic, normal to this environment rather than a useless random addition to the story. I ranked him 9 out of 10 at first ... and then I went back and tried to think about why I did not give him that last point. Came with nothing. So it's ten out of ten. After all - I'm not a big critic - the fact that I bother to write a review means that I really hate the movie or really like it. You can tell which side I am with Moon Child.
