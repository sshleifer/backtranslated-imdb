I thought this movie was very nice. I watched this movie with my wife BEFORE having my first child. Therefore, I did not just look at it as a family entertainment and I still enjoyed it. It seems that many critics point out that this film is not overwhelming, that there were no unexpected changes in script and that the film was predictable and boring. If these people watched this film hoping to live a religious experience, they would obviously be disappointed. It's just an animated film; nothing more. If you want to see this movie just to sit back and have fun, you will not be disappointed. In closing, this is certainly not the best movie that Disney has done, but it's entertaining and I do not understand the bad reputation it has received.
