This title, with "Hare Tonic", is one of the best Bugs cartoons, or even one of the best Bugs of all time. There are some comments on how Bugs in these drawings is "basic", which means, I suppose, that it is not yet fully developed. In fact, I prefer this "basic" version of the mid-40s (the best version of Chuck Jones), which is actually more cute and much more fun than the long-legged version that dominated Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The Bugs of the last days have become too sweet and sophisticated for my taste. Also check out "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for great examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
