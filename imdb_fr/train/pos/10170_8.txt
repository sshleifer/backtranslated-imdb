Contrary to the opinions expressed by the other reviewer, this movie was surprisingly good! Reluctantly, I went to see him and was expecting to be bored by clich√©s, obvious jokes and excessive acts, which the trailer promised. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes of play, I really had fun laughing and enjoying the refreshment acting. Over Her Dead Body manages to create realistic and entertaining scenarios without spoiling too much, but some of the moments involving animals are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The basic ingredients of a good movie are all there; Scenario, director and actors and compared to some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands proudly. <br /> <br /> Of course, you will not learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an Open Mind, you will probably have a good time!
