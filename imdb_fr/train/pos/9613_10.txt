It's hard to describe Bug in words, it's one of those movies you really have to see to be understood. It follows a story more fluid and interesting than anything I saw recently in a Hollywood version. As his characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and events dictate different paths for the characters, the audience is just an observer. The almost Proustian narrative flow from thought to thought, the very spontaneity of the script will make you stick to the screen, waiting impatiently to see how all this will take place at the end. And as for the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy to brilliant and beautiful, then tragic, all in the space of a minute or so. And it works. <br /> <br /> This film is pure magic. It reminds us why the independent film is perhaps the brightest star in the current film industry. Maybe with more Bug-quality movies, people will start to notice.
