Here is a favorite cartoon of Tom and Jerry perfect for Halloween. I know he does not have a lot of goosebumps, but he has the "trick" like in "Trick or Treat", as Jerry did with Tom with the window awning and the vacuum with a collar shirt hanging over to make it look like a ghost; but I still like to put it on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short film, Tom listened to "Witching Hour," a ghostly radio show, and was scared by the horrible story told. Halfway through the story, the drama (her hair up, her heart beating in her throat, the cold chills on her spine) begin to reach Tom. . . Literally. And Jerry watched all this and laughed for himself, thinking to increase Tom's fears by frightening him. <br /> <br /> I like the end, it was a little funny. And you know, this short is the first of four drawings in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; the others being the lonely mouse, a house mouse and Nit-Witty Kitty. And also This short is the first of twenty-five cartoons where Tom speaks. The Others are The Lone Mouse, The Zoot Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Bodyguard, The Mouse Bug, The Mouse Comes At Dinner, Calm Please!, Happy Trap, Serenade Solid, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse, And The Cat Above And The Mouse Below Directed By Chuck Jones.
