The wooden horse is one of the first "great" escape narratives of the Second World War. It tells the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this movie, but I read the book when I was in high school, after seeing part of the film in the early '60s on television. The provocative drama of Peter and John trying to escape Germany during the war is more realistic than the escapees described in the Great Escape. This film is a lost treasure, which should be made more accessible to the American public.
