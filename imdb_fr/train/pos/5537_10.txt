Maybe it was not as good overall, but the second episode, which was the first one I said, was so memorable that I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries. <br /> <br /> The acolyte's cockney slang, Chico Barnes, is a lot more fun for those of us who have never heard of the London Bow Bells, but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting. <br /> <br /> Sid Halley was one of Francis's most interesting characters, and the show minimized some of the difficulties of his hand. Interestingly, the electronic hands of the type used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than those invented after the Second World War.
