A Chinese ghost story of Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark, besides being one of the greatest wuxia piano films ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as a martial arts movie choreographed in an impressive way that should be part of the collection of all movie lovers. Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays the role of a tax collector who spends the night in a haunted temple. During his stay in the temple, he meets colorful characters, including swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, The Tree Devil, and the magnificent ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the charming Joey Wong. <br /> To free her from the clutches of the evil Tree Devil, he must reincarnate and go to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon. <br /> <br /> We can not say enough about the good things this movie. The rhythm is perfect, with an excellent combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor. The rhythmic final with fever should leave you with little chance to breathe. The chemistry between Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended way too soon) and tragically wonderful really allows the viewer to feel both. In fact, the game as a whole is so lively and full of life that I would say it's one of the most entertaining viewing experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his interpretation of the mysterious Swordsman Yin. His extraordinary character of a disillusioned swordsman, determined to overcome evil, leads to great moments of humor and traditional drama in Hong Kong. A beautiful score, a lush cinematography in vibrant colors and frantic action scenes of Ching Siu Tung complete this beautiful film. Find a copy wherever you can. 10/10
