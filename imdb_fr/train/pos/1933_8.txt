This indie movie chronicles the life of a group of people taking an adult swimming lesson in Connecticut. The plot is pretty thin. What animates the film are the characters, excellently interpreted by mostly unknown actors. Brewster is a high school teacher struggling with marital problems and Weixler, a casino croupier who stands out as a stripper. Both actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive first film for writer Schechter and director Setton. This keeps the story moving to a fast clip. The title and the movie poster suggest something sizzling, but it's a wonderful little comedy drama.
