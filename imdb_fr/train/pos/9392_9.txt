I came home late one night and turned on the television to see Siskel and Ebert summarize their choice of the week. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West" except for two thumbs up before seeing him. It would not stay long in the room because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better. <br /> <br /> The following afternoon, I followed their advice. They were right, it was one of the funniest moments I've ever seen at the movies. As some readers point out, there are some holes in the plot and the last 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's worth it, for the beautiful craftsmanship of the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems perfectly interpreted. Dennis Hopper goes almost to the end, which is ridiculous, but enhances the effectiveness of everything else. The sets and the music contribute a lot to almost all the scenes. <br /> <br /> When I rented it later for my family, it did not work as well. The long scenes that created the tension in the theater were hard to appreciate, with distractions at home. This deserves your full attention. turn off the phone, be sure not to be disturbed, watch and listen to each scene, especially at the beginning.
