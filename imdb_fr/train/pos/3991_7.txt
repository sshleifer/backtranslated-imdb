"If I sit down, I will never get up again", that is what the mother (of the title) says to her son when he tells her to rest (she is just a widow). It means that rest is what a woman of her age and situation must do: rest in peace, neglect herself. But she is not in the mood to "rest," not yet. She also has a daughter who blames her for all the disasters of her life ... Suddenly, the revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter under thirty years old (Daniel Craig, the brand new James Bond) when she "thought that no one would touch her anymore". It's a story that makes you think about a lot of things, especially what a 60-year-old woman is supposed to do with her life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we have advanced in these areas. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a film with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it were otherwise? An old woman, a young man ... no, you're not ready for that, are you? <br /> <br /> The film has intimate tones throughout its length, with the exception of 2 or 3 sequences in which the tones break and come out of the dialogues explicit and rude. These vulgar contacts and the way the son and daughter discover their mother's love affair (quite absurd - you'll know what I mean when you look at it) are the only discordant elements of "The Mother". <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
