In this sequel to K-9, the detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee come back to fight the crime, but this time, they team up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and his partner, a bad Doberman has named Zues who does not get along very well with Jerry Lee. Dooley does not get along a lot with his new partner either. It changes throughout the film. The film is intense because it's a guy who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he handled it in the past. Some dramatic scenes about the death of Dooley's wife do not seem to fit the tone of the film, as the rest of the film is action scenes, shit jokes, dog jokes and dog jokes who bite the wicked. in a certain area. I know that sounds very humorous, but some of them are actually very funny. I did not see this movie for jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is that I am a big fan of James Belushi and the second is for action sequences. James Belushi is funnier than in K-9 and the action sequences are better. It would have been nice to see more K-9 characters come back, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this movie.
