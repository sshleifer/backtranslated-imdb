I think I received this movie when I was young. I remembered seeing him as a child, but I was never able to find the movie. I remembered the good old Rageddy Ann, Andy, Babette, The Greedy, King Koo Koo. I searched high and low for this film and still no luck. But one day when I left my childhood home, I found it. We were together. I am 17 years old now. I'm watching him again. All the time, actually. It's one of the funniest and most touching films I've ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally, I think they should do a sequel. Mmm, yes a sequel indeed. Now, I even think of having the captain of the birds tattooed somewhere on my body!
