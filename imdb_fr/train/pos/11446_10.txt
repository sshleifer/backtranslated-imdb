Right now, I'm watching this movie for the second time (on TV) and for the second time I've fallen in it while it's been running for an hour (I think I've seen 2 more minutes this time) This movie is truly impressive, the way Goldsworthy views nature, modifies it unimaginably, is truly incredible. All this film gives you a warm feeling to see him play with the world around him with such love. Or only seeing his hands, covered with dirt and broken nails, it touches you.
