I do not know why I chose this film, it has a strange title and, according to its description, it looked like something different. From time to time, it's good to try a slightly different film from the traditional Hollywood movie / hero movie and this film was certainly different. From the beginning, this movie intrigued me, but I could not understand why until the end if I realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real. I thought the acting was great and that the development of the character makes you really concerned about them and hopes that everything will be fine for them at the end. I think that all those who watch the film could somehow have a link with one of the characters, which makes it an excellent viewing and a good laugh at the banality of the actors. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, you really have a feeling of well-being and you end up with the type of "feeling that will go well". I'm sure it will be very appealing and we should give it a chance.
