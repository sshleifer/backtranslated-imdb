Prix ​​de Beauté was built at the dawn of the transition from silence to sound, a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a dumb, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress speaking Louise Brooks lines, but it was published as silent in Italy and other regions Europe. I had the chance to see the new impeccable restoration of a silent Italian print by the Cineteca di Bologna at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen the talkie version yet, but I think it is safe to assume that the silent version is much more satisfying, because, according to all reports, the dubbing is poorly done (Louise Brooks speaks clearly English There is no risk In addition, the film is entirely shot in the silent style, with few titles and little dialogue.Price beauty tells its story in a visual way, with an exciting camera work and The opening is instantly kinetic, with scenes of urban life cut off quickly and swimmers bathing on a public beach.Throughout the film, the focus is on visual details, clothing, machinery, decoration and symbolic images such as a caged bird, a pile of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet.This is the silent film technique at its peak. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks, of course , is responsible for safeguarding the This only makes it even more heartbreaking to think it was his last major role. Very beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural performance but very busy. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for which she is better known, is a woman that we can perfectly understand and sympathize with. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive fiancé, who aspires to better enjoy life and secretly participates in a beauty contest, with immediate success. She is torn between the excitement of her new glamorous life and her love for the man who insists that she renounce everything or lose it. All characters are drawn with nuance. The fiancé inspires pity and is not simply a brute: he loves Lucienne, but he is a limited man who can not cope with the fact that she has a life apart or draws the attention of others men. Even the other man in the story is not the simple slimeball for which we take it first, although his intentions may be as possessive as those of the fiance. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW *********** ****** <br /> <br /> The film has many beautiful sets of pieces, including the triumph of Lucienne in the contest "Miss Europe", illustrated by the comical reactions of various spectators, who end up giving flowers with heroin; her household misery peels potatoes while the cuckoo's clock marks the time behind her; a nightmarish journey in a carnival (in the silent version, this happens late in the film, after her marriage), during which Lucienne, crushed in the low lives and depressed by the macho antics of her husband, decides that she can not go with her present existence; and especially the final scene in the screening room where she looks at her walkie screen test. Louise Brooks may never have been as beautiful as she is here, with the beam of the projector flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders wrapped in white fur, her face glowing under the black hair helmet as she sits. saw singing on the screen. The double photo of her exquisite corpse and her image still alive on screen is particularly poignant: the image of Louise Brooks, like that of Lucienne, remains immortal despite her aborted filming career.
