This film contains scenes that come back to me in the strangest times - this intense scene with Mr. Muckerji telling Ms. Melandez that someone to whom he spoke has witnessed that the girl was pushed out the window by a a woman who fits her description - she is one who rolls - the way she refers to him by name - with a Greek accent "Mr Muckerji" - and then when Boyer discovers her taking poison and gives her a last punch in front of her head she dies --- it's a delight! "Fools - fools - all my life" ... etc etc - you get the point .. I have to buy this one. I love acting Dan Seymour - he usually plays a sultan or a foreign and plump police chief and has appeared in Casablanca with many great photos.
