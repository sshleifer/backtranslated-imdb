I have seen Maslin Beach several times, both on free TV in Brisbane. I will not go into detail, whether good or bad, because others have covered it. <br /> <br /> I'll say it's so Australian. In Australia only, we can watch a film about the relationships between people who spend the day as naked as the day of their birth and watch it on free commercial television. <br /> <br /> I have a friend from the United States who is constantly amazed by what we put on our free television compared to his home country. Sex and the City and Huff are all too many examples. <br /> <br /> Despite our government's efforts to transform us into the 51st state, it's good to know that at least some things are really Australian
