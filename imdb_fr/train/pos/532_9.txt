Enchanting, romantic, innovative and fun. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unprecedented, surpassing more famous "death novels" such as Ghost. We know intuitively that Peter and June will find the ultimate happiness at the end of this long and long staircase, but the joy lies in their journey. The moral of the story is of course timeless: love triumphs over everything. But the fight to win this victory takes place in a heavenly arena characterized by a panoramic vision and a striking grandeur. With more than 500 appropriately dressed extras representing diverse ages and cultures, directors' vision of the sky remains memorable six decades later, well before the CGI era. <br /> <br /> But Powell and Pressburger knew all the cosmic scale an essential truth: the best story is told at the lowest level. The wonderfully and resolutely romantic aspect of "Stairway" is captured with ultimate simplicity: the June tear, preserved on a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This film, like the story and the decor itself, is one for all ages.
