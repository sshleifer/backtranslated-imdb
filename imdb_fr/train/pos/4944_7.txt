Not many things happen in this movie but a lot of meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but that was not the case. She discovered it herself when she met this person who was doing research for her next job. There really should be more types of movies like this one, not even as old as the one considered "mature" (I'm actually 13) and I always had the idea and purpose of the movie. The main point is in my opinion: DO NOT THINK THAT YOU CAN NOT HAVE A BETTER LIFE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS LATEST. <br /> <br /> Even though I must admit that I was thinking of watching another movie, After reading all the reviews and seeing the trailer, I decided for this one even though I knew that few action would appear in the movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it contains very good points and ends really well.
