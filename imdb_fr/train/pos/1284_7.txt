I watched The Babysitter as part of "BCI Eclipse Drive-In Classic Movies" (including Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This film contains a lot of history in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual irregularities, blackmail and murders all in one place! <br /> <br /> The main actors do a credible job. And I found the complex weaving intrigue credible and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the distribution of support, mainly bikers, offers an overheated performance, especially if it is asked to deliver lines with more than a few words. Maybe they used real bikers, instead of actors. Some characters, in particular, were exceptionally credible. <br /> <br /> The musical score is absolutely perfect, for the time, the tempo and to advance the story. I found the music a real treat. I noticed in the opening credits that the film contained the music of "The Food", I searched for them on Google; but, nothing was found ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, George E. Carey who wrote, produced and played in this movie liked the idea (of a lost and married man, brought back to redemption the trials and tribulations, and, a little help - of course - that he wrote, produced and performed in "Weekend with the Guardian".
