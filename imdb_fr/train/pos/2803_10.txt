As a former world champion of karate twice in Okinawan, I like the movies about sacrifice for sport. But this movie has a lot more to offer. This film is so good and so profound. I recently suffered a very serious injury and a disastrous lack of passion. Almost off for me. And that silly little movie touched me so deeply that, as in a dizziness, it reminded me of what life is supposed to be. This is a movie about life. Live your life for yourself and respect others. Empowerment. God bless "bend him like Beckham" I think it's a real gem.
