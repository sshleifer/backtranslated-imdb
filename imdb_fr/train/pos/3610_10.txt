Girlfight tells the story of a troubled teenager named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is overwhelmed by her mother's suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community. A short mood and many things to light a fire, she is about to be fired from school to fight. His brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), trains with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. His father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), entrusted Diana with the payment of this week of payment for the formation of Tiny. While Diana is walking in the gym, she realizes that she wants to do that. She wants to box. Diana asks her father for money to train, but he refuses because she is a girl and should do more things "girly". All Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy. Not despised because she is a woman. She steals money from her father to start training. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie. Genius, pure genius 'effing'. Recommend it to anyone who needs to see a good clean film without "monkey business".
