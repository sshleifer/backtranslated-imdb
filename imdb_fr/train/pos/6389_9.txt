Passing stones is without a doubt one of the best independent comedy films of all time. You must have a sense of humor to take full advantage of it. This film for some reason did not receive credit. First, let's start with the story, everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters telling him a hidden treasure, not only does he unite two families, but he begins a quick adventure. Mix a polish translator, a comatose mother, a cracked head with turret syndrome, a crooked homosexual hypnotist and a drag queen: Money not only turns the world, but can turn the family into an enemy. My favorite character in this movie should be the crack sister / addict with the turret syndrome, her sudden burst will make you cry and mimic for weeks.
