Well done, giving the point of view of the other side doktor fraulein reflects both the cost and uselessness of the war. an excellent actor especially when the German high command refuses, in the name of chivalry, to present the medal ordered by kaiser struck. the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for the effaced American minds who would probably prefer idiotic speeches and senseless abstractions like 14 points or league of nations. true Americans could appreciate history and action. For all the action and plot, Fraulein Doktor compares favorably to Jacob's Ladder.
