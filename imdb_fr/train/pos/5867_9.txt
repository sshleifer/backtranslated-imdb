Jacknife is a masterpiece from the '80s. It's a movie that breathes through incredible acting and a very interesting director touch. In Jacknife, the two lovers of European and American cinema can find topics of relationship. The scenario is very convincing and is full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris gives one of the greatest performances to date. He depicts his alcoholic hero making us feel his broken heart superbly in every line, in every movement. Robert De Niro makes us think of him again as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also the most realistic performances of his career. Jacknife never gets boring as he shows his heroes that he does not contain any typical elements of the Hollywood character. After the war, none is a hero. Everyone is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. No one can repair his works after a war, just like the heroes of this film. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul created by the war. Simply beautiful film.
