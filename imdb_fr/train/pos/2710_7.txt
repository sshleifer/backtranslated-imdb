It's not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it's one of the most famous films in the subgenre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who at this stage had already produced some WIP. It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. The film takes place in an American prison and not in a "banana republic" like most WIP movies. I do not know if it was a good move, but it's an acceptable change of pace. Screenwriter-director Demme is passionate about her work, always looking for new ways to present a familiar storyline. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates some surreal dream sequences on the verge of pretension, but it's amusing to see how much he's trying to put this film on top of your average movie of chained chicks. But do not worry, Demme still works in the settings of the subgenre. There is a lot of nudity and violence, which will satisfy fans of hardcore. The movie is a bit slow, but very entertaining. The casting is good. Roberta Collins is a veteran of WIP, so she does not need to be introduced and Barbara Steel is a horde of crazy wheelchair goaltender. Pam Grier misses us tremendously.
