"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful, haunting and incredibly provocative feature. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who in 1980 witnessed a horrific sight, saw her 3-month-old baby being brutally abducted from their family's tent while camping in the back of Australia. Azariah (the baby) has never been seen again and the result of his atrocious disappearance has provoked a veritable frenzy of life around the world. Meryl Streep renders immaculate justice to Lindy's role, as she always does. But the only thing that helps "A cry in the dark" never falls flat is the shining direction. A truly inspired and accurate point of view on this confusing affair, tears in the eyes. The concept is nothing but terrifying, and you will remain haunted and inspired.
