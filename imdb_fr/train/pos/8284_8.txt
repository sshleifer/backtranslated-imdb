This is one of those unique horror movies that require a much more mature understanding of the word "horror" for it to be appreciated. The main thing that people may not realize is that this story is told by a little boy's point of view and, like most younger children, he is easily scared. Mainly because he simply does not understand things, for example why his father is almost never there for him. As you watch the movie, you can see the husband talking to his wife about the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it, but the little boy does not understand. One can also imagine that the boy is afraid of wood, as it is established at the beginning of the film, that the family comes from the city. In addition, at first, while the family was going home, they hit a stag, then got cheated, they quarreled with the locals and the little boy certainly did not find this pleasant introduction in Woods. <br /> <br /> The "Wendigo" is ultimately what his innocent young mind makes to explain it all. There is the Native American legend, but when you look at the scene where the boy hears about it, it is explained in a brusque and simplistic way. Not because that's what the Wendigo is actually, but because that's how he understands it. When you watch the film from this point of view, you can really start to appreciate it. Obviously, it was a reduced budget and a cheaper shot, but the jumps, the use of light and general concern more than make up for it. And the last question asked by the movie is this: Is everything in your head or is it really there? 8/10 <br /> <br /> R-rated: blasphemy, violence and sex scene
