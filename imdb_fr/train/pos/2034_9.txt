I have never been huge on IMAX movies. They're cool, but once you've overcome that initial rush of "Whoa, it feels like you're flying!" the movies themselves are usually pretty tacky and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The exceptions were the mighty "Everest", the exhilarating "Wild California" and, now, the movie "The Human Body" of the BBC, a large-format look on the inside of our body. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of inconceivable complexity. This 50-minute film could last 10 hours and would still not touch all the tandem systems as I would type this review and listen to my radio, and most of us take it for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of an inflamed heart (which looks like an alien spacecraft), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs of your eardrum that resonate well, the development a baby in a mother uterus and, surprisingly, some of the ... uh, less attractive functions that I thought I would run away (pimples, acid turbulence in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> > This film also has a rather funky style, which distinguishes it from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've all seen the sperm make their way to the egg, but have you ever seen that it was set on Marvin Gaye's air, "Let's Get It On"? Creative moments like this make the "Human Body" not only a lesson in health, but also pleasure.
