An absolute classic !! The management is impeccable, the acting is simply superb. Words are missing for this great job. The most definitive film about the Mumbai police. This film has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil not less. All the actors have done their best and the film races are always exciting. This film shakes your whole being and forces you to rethink the many problems our society is facing. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a policeman (Om Puri) who begins his career as an honest man but finally degenerates into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood to be behind the scenes and reveal the depressing truth about the Mumbai police. Congratulations to Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film, a multitude of Bollywood films were broadcast that revealed the link between criminals, politicians and police. So, this movie was really a trendsetter. This trend has dominated the Hindi film scene for more than ten years. <br /> <br /> This film was a moderate success at the box office. <br /> <br /> A must for discerning moviegoers.
