I only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Made almost 30 years ago, I thought scary moments would be more tame. The boy was I was wrong. There are great moments that made me cold in the back. Even the acting was awesome, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was superb. <br /> <br /> The downside is that it can be slow enough to start, but once it starts, nothing is possible. He makes all the copies, for example Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very tame. I can not really say it's the best of Carpenter because I have not seen much, the only one I can remember is the Starman (I think he did). Halloween is the crowning glory of the horror genre.
