The biggest film of Pressburger and Powell. David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death but is given a second chance to live when God realizes he is AWOL and sends an angel to investigate. The scene where young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in battle, arrive in paradise to be treated for eternal life is unbearably poignant. Watch also Roger Livesey, a very underrated actor, and Kim Hunter as a love interest (later, of course, Zira in The Planet of the Apes). Steven Spielberg also chose the actress who played the role of Chief Angel (Kathleen Byron) as the elderly wife of Saving Private Ryan's eponymous soldier half a century later, an act that speaks volumes. on his aptitude for cinema.
