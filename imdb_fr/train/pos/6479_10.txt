It is above all a fantastic series. It is very well done and very interesting. As a great lover of the Second World War, I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things to do is that all interviews with people from the past, when the war was still fresh in their mind, compared to what they were. It's nothing against the men you see being interviewed in today's programs, it's just that most of these men did not really participate at the highest levels of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the story of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about World War II, but I really think only the intrepid (like myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this series is that some facts are not as accurate as we know it now. Especially with information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or just inaccurate in places. We now know that this information is different because of the fall of the USSR. Overall, a fascinating look at the Second World War and a must for any historian of the Second World War, whether professional or personal.
