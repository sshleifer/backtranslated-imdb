A strange man but emotionally disturbing about a man (William H. Macy) who is fed up who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) led by his father, a man too demanding ( Donald Sutherland) while seeing a shrink (John Ritter)) and flirting with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> You are talking about a major dilemma, but "Panic" is a high level thriller that looks like "American Beauty" meets "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are the stars here. Remarkable beginning for first author / director Henry Bromell. I am surprised that this film did not have the chance to stay in the room more than two weeks.
