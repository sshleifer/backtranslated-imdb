My favorite movie of all time! I saw a lot of movies, but this one beats them all! Excellent actor, wonderful story. As a "normal" person, you will begin to love George. Although he is an actor, he is also himself and a very kind person. And the most important thing: you'll learn to respect and look different from people with Down syndrome.
