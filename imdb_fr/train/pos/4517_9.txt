With this subject, it is so easy to take cheap pictures. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does a great job in making Gerald a REAL person, a person who really matters to you, so you feel that he's missing out on trying to live as Gerald and Geraldine at the same time. Not only that, but like Geraldine, he looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel in love with each other and it feels even when they look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially disturbing series of corporate takeovers is credible and you find yourself cheering in the end! At least I did it!
