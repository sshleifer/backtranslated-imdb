Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this remarkable example of brotherly love and commitment. Hulce plays the role of Dominick (Nicky), a mildly mentally handicapped young man who puts his 12-minute twin brother, Liotta, who plays Eugene, through medical school. It takes place in Baltimore and discusses issues of sibling rivalry, the inseparable bond of twins, child abuse, and the good that always triumphs over evil. It's captivating and filled with laughter and tears. If you have not seen this movie yet, rent it, please, you'll be amazed at how wonderful a movie can go unnoticed.
