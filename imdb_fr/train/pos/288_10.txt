This movie was so great! I am a teenager and my friends and I love the show. This shows that these films attract the attention of all ages. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite phrase in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "pink cheeks" when he talks about his little girl. He's a great actor, just like Erin Cottrell. They associate so well and have such chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are such attractive people and very good actors. I finally found some interesting movies to watch. Lately, it has been difficult for me to find films that are good, that show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not tacky.
