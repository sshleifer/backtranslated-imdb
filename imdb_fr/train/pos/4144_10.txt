For a moment, I found myself trapped. I found myself watching independent and foreign films and telling myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception. It's the truth. It's the best "bad" movie of all time. <br /> <br /> The "wickedness" of this film seems to come naturally. In the middle of Satan's opening monologue, the word "Hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man wearing a wig and a thrift dress. It takes the eccentric couple trying to kill each other forever to go down the stairs. Jesus goes to a funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost his mandate for advising a film project for the elderly. But it is the sincerity of the seriousness of the situation. You get the impression that officials knew it was going to be bad, but had never forced it. <br /> <br /> Never reproduce wonderfully, amaze Fatty. Strongly recommended.
