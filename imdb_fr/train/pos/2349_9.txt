It is a pleasure to see such creativity on television. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters relate well and the writing is not bad (I think it will improve as they get their legs). Well worth a visit. <br /> <br /> Girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable as Olive. Both aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope that they will write them in bigger pieces because they are magical. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all the relevant news to be printed. Prepare a large bowl of popcorn and have fun in the old fashioned way. It's like Dr. Seuss for adults.
