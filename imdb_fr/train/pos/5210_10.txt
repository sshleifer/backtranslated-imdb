It's a pity she did not have credit on the screen, she did the best job of the movie with the girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. . She almost made S / M look like fun! She really believed that the S / M model was afraid of her situation. Although they seem to have really spoiled this dreaming feeling of looking for the bad guy, these sets were very well built, but they just wiped the surface of what had been shot. It is a film where both cuts should be available. It seems they have left out a lot of what was shot and almost all the really dark stuff that would have made the movie much more crazy. It's a bit like they stopped before the mark they had during the shoot. What was shot would not have gotten the R rating, probably an NC-17 or an X, but that's what he would have needed to make the film as it should have been.
