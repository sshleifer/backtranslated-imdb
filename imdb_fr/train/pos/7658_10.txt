<br /> <br /> I have seen this movie several times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, engraved in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which Mickey Rooney, - "Killer Mears" knows that he must be executed and that he approaches the moment of truth, He dances and cries and laughs wobbles of hesteria to euphoria and runs the panoply of all emotion. I have never seen such a brilliant performance of a living or dead actor, past or present. That's when I know for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is a great genius actor. However I have kept it, my opinion for me for years thinking, I must surely be alone in this point of view. About fifteen years after watching this film for the last time on television, I had the chance to read the old question and answer section of the Los Angeles Times. The question that was asked of Lawrence Olivier was: "Mr. Olivier, you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, who do you think are among the greatest?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned, but not surprised. I immediately remembered his "Killer Mears" and I felt very good to have seen this great ability in him, and now to have my point of view supported by another job that I admired. Later, of course, there was "Bill" and many other moments with Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Kilometer" should be seen by all theater students. Frankly, I do not remember much of the movie after all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave me. If anyone remembers this movie like me? I would be interested in hearing from you. For this image engraved in my heart alone, I gave him a 10 just on the face of his performance.
