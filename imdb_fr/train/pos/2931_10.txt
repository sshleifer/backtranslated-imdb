Eddie Murphy Delirious is without a doubt the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life. When I first saw it about 2 years ago, I was sewn for weeks afterwards. To date, I have seen it 17 more times and I still make fun of the buttocks every time. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy was a brilliant comedian before being a Hollywood superstar. There is not one boring place in this piece of genius, unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, released in 1987, which falls flat in the middle. If you're not the kind of person who can not stand to swear, I would not advise you to see it because you will probably hear swearing any shape every 5 to 10 seconds. I gave it a 10 out of 10 because it displays the best comic genius of all at its best.
