Browse this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie $ (2007) is simply a better (kinematic) version of Norma Khouri's book, Forbidden Love, and it's a bestseller. A peel of literally fraudulent onions and a pretty woman, Lie $ is the best of editorial reality TV. <br /> <br /> Nicely altered and colorful, Broinowski's narration is embellished with moving figures of Norma Khouri smoking. I do not agree (with Variety) that it's too long; Instead, my only small problem was related to the episodic nature of its main actors commenting on testimonials that others had recorded. On one screen, your sense of narration becomes confused ..... so I watched it twice. <br /> <br /> This Oscar-worthy effort is at once truly funny, overwhelming and totally captivating as it documents one lie after another. The case seems to be unfolding in the Australian state of Queensland via very personal scams from friends and fans of Khouri (!). Clearly, these friends are now "shot," the funniest camera-owned line owned by Rachel Richardson, QLD's neighbor of Khouri, who talks about her disillusionment in familiar flat and no-nonsense terms: "I think that's a charge of sh! T. Personally ". /> <br /> We must learn from their experience, hence my confidence in spoilers. Any spinner of eternal lies caught in a lie will say anything to buy time to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There are breathtaking images of Khouri crying derisively to deceive this very documentary filmmaker, who instead presses his "artist" repeatedly for corroboration. <br /> <br /> Since it was broken by Sydney Morning The journalists of Herald, Caroline Overington and David Knox, one year after its publication, Khouri was on the run, but was tempted by the director to allegedly erase his name. She fled supposedly because she a) either she is terrified by her devious husband, more Italian than the Greek, or b) because she needed her passport / visas to whitewash the name. <br /> <br /> Unlikely. <br /> <br /> A more plausible reason is that the FBI found its footprint in Queensland before going back overseas (an assumption: no, not Jordan). According to a closing card, Khouri is "still under FBI investigation" in 2007. <br /> <br /> I assumed that the audience could give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need absolute secrecy and subterfuge. Instead, the audience I sat with became just as disillusioned as the people on the screen. Once they understood, there was a lot of mockery and shouting; A little earlier, sighs had been stressed by listeners who simply did not know how to take into account the evolution of Khouri's contradictions. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker receives accessories that cover so nicely this convoluted story from beginning to end, without forgetting anything. - not even his own sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration from Khouri herself. The reason for creating it is very credibly told at the beginning - the key to how a long-time liar operates: in half-truths. Khouri is nevertheless a very handsome and clever 35 year old with a rather disarming charm and, surprisingly, elaborate biceps. <br /> <br /> Little by little, we became familiar with the newspapers, editors and fans who first bought the extent of Khouri's accusations, who kill the honor, hang, spin and saddled. We will see later their reactions more sad, fairly controlled and factual, although some are perhaps a bit bitter. <br /> <br /> These are Jordanian (anti) -humor activists who murdered the honor Khouri's misconceptions because his pot hopping made him reduce the pace of change. Honor killings occur in Jordan; it is simply their prevalence that contradicts Khouri's book - plus 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists sent 73 carefully verified objections to Random House (Australian). <br /> <br /> The publishing houses of 4 continents who had jumped at the opportunity to publish their first author, Khouri, had never tried to verify facts. Leaving all corroboration to a disclaimer in their copyright contract, they too were a fair game. It was therefore as easy to deceive the world about fraud involving a hot topic as to type it into cybercaf√©s. <br /> <br /> Later, we are shocked to discover that "factual errors" extend to Khouri's bio well. On the one hand, not only is she not a 35-year-old virgin (her only defense is not to disabuse people of her assumptions), but she also has a slickster husband and two teenagers! Sometimes she speaks too fast with her American accent. She also seems too comfortable with mobile phone technology and western clothing. I realize that such observations may seem prejudicial to Jordanian women who do not need any Western paternalism on my part, but even when cultural signals do not fit with Khouri's "facts," you must begin to question your source. . <br /> <br /> At one point, the filmmaker came to the same conclusion. She is making an admirable effort to hold Khouri accountable, in person, in Jordan. The last third is consumed with a study trip to Amman, where one "fact" after another falls. Finally, Broinowski forces his "artist" (con) to admit the shift of his decade narrative, and it is after that that Khouri records his derisory secret confessions in his own digital camera. Secret, because in Khouri's "American security guard", Jeremy would have an Australian accent: he's an actor! (We never find out how Anna discovered it.) <br /> <br /> This becomes the filmmaker's triumph, because she never stands out in tone or commitment. His revelations on camera lead his audience to learn from the mistakes of others in the face of such a litany of reasonable doubt, FBI documents - and Khouri's most shocking initial crime. <br /> <br /> Anna Broinowski (watch her now)) is even clever enough to use the only artistic medium (key players comment on a video) to kill two birds - which makes her audience want to drink again from the same well. <br /> <br /> In fact, despite her falsely wise approach, she made me reconfirm that Overington and Knox had really won their Walkleys in Investigate Journalism 2004 for their "Norma Khouri Survey". <br /> <br /> Broinowski drove me crazy (10/10)
