Probably the most beautiful fantasy film ever made. Sumptuous colors, spectacular scenery, an incredible musical score of Miklos Rosza, perfect for every scene and atmosphere. Acting is superb also in what could have been stiff and pretentious in less important hands, but here the poetic dialogue is skillfully said with sensitivity (the humor is also subtle and delicious). were captivated by this one. With "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two best films published by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the finest films ever made. <br /> <br /> classic!
