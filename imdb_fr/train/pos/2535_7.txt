Professor Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force to use for atomic power. Unfortunately, Rukh has been contaminated by radium and begins to shine in the dark - and his contact causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) is developing an antidote - but Rukh starts to go mad because of the Radium AND the antidote and begins to kill everything he thought he had done wrong. <br /> The "effects" that make Karloff shine in the dark are laughable, but it's still a fun little cooler. It moves quickly, has a good atmosphere (note Rukh's "house" and the film begins with a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. Franic Drake (Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (his mother) play well. So fine, but just a step below all the other Karloff / Lugosi films. The plot is too exaggerated for me to swallow it. Yet I did like that. I give him a 7.
