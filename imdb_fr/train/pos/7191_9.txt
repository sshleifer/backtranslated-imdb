Reed Hadley makes Don Diego more fascinated than he is with a daring and daring Zorro, but that's pretty much relevant, as this series contains the best musical track of all the leaflets of all time, as well as than the best version of Yakima Canutt's famous diligence. cascade. There are other good stunts, and a lot of action, and a lot of end-chapters, but if it's not for another reason, you have to watch this movie to watch the cascade of stagecoach, then see again in slow motion. It's amazing, and despite the reduced budget for this chapter piece, Yak better interprets the waterfall here than in the much more famous movie "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart: it's the real deal!
