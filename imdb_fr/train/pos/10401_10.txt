Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief. "The thief from Baghdad" was my favorite movie as a child and he never ceased to amaze or enchant me. I loved this film from the first moment I saw it, when I was a six-year-old boy who started reading "The Thousand and One Nights". I remember entering the TV room in the middle of the Sabu battle against the giant spider and being instantly seduced. <br /> <br /> Rarely have such beauty, magic and wonder been filmed. Sabu and John Justin are stunning as the frisky heroes, Conrad Veidt is as ravishing as the mean villain Jaffar and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as sardonic genius. Georges Perinal's photography is one of the best uses of Technicolor. One of the three award-winning directors is Michael Powell, a critically acclaimed filmmaker, but the public often forgets him for his remarkable films, including "A Question of Life and Death" (aka "Stairway to Heaven") and " The Red Shoes." He is one of the true masters of the camera, alongside David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> As with all great works of art, the beauty of "The Thief of Baghdad" is in the detail. Each image has its magic charm. The story never lingers, and the characters and their actions always involve. Here is a movie that will never get old.
