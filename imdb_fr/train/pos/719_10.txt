Although this film is the best cheese, it is perfectly successful. This film, without a doubt, must be considered as a modern classic. I basically enjoy two types of movies: the ones that have depth (girls' movies, if you have to - I blame my wife for that) and the brainless comedies where I can sit and relax. This film is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine introduced me to this movie shortly after it was released. Considering me a bit superficial, he said to me, "You have to see this movie, it's just your type of movie." By giving up the insult, I started to look. I know they mentioned the Ramones a million times, but when you saw them, I said, "Hey, this is The Ramones." My friend replied, "I did not know they were a real band." I had my moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This film, although now a little outdated, is a must for fans of Ramones - or anyone else.
