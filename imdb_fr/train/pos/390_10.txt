The first thing I thought about when I saw this movie was: It's not really a movie, at least that's not what we spontaneously imagine when we hear the word "movie". it is entirely symbolic, everything has a figurative meaning. So, if you are not used to expressing things in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you do not know philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it's just a fairy tale .. and even a strange tale. chaotic. For me "The legend of Zu" is perfectly transparent. And I like it. He tells us in pictures the story of the struggle between light and darkness, a struggle as old as humanity and confronting all those who are searching for meaning in this life. The film is obviously made by Buddhists. I am not Buddhist My religion and the worldview and the man are different. But to the extent that we are all human beings and have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other. It's a very beautiful movie! And I had more movies like this - movies that make sense. There are too many empty stories that are only useful for passing the time faster.
