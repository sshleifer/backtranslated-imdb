It's a short film by David Lynch with only 8 minutes, but it contains all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, inconclusive, strange and strange; and before the blonde starts talking, it's even a little scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this strange atmosphere because it is also sinister and mysterious ?? <br /> <br /> About the decor itself, it does not have the "traditional" red curtains, but the walls painted in purple, which give it an equally scary effect. <br /> The intrigue speaks of a girl who is locked in a dark room and crying for help; then comes another girl who begins to talk to her in a mysterious way, saying that she is there just because of her fault ?? We do not know what happened or what will happen next? it ended unsolved and confusing, like a good movie Lynch must finish! <br /> <br /> This is a very good short film, despite the amateur acting game. Girls are professional actresses, but I think their role could have been better in this short film.
