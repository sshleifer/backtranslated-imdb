When I heard Patrick Swayze finally return to his acting career with KING SOLOMON'S MINES, I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones action adventure. What I had was a 4-hour epic (with commercials) that was very slow. The second and third hours could have been completely abandoned and history would not have suffered. The end was good (no spoilers here) but I had to want more. Anything that a guy can do is a prey that Swayze makes in "Roadhouse 2" in order to get back into the kind of action that made him famous. Until you are a fan of King Solomon's mines, read the book or look at the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is not very good, but his hour and forty minutes of your life have passed instead of 4 hours.
