Beautifully made with a wonderful Gretchen Moll performance, she captured such happiness in her work. The recreatments of small films and photographs are perfectly realized and often hilarious. According to Harron, they used film films that are no longer produced and a fifties-style studio lighting, even for outdoor locations, to give the colorful parts its distinctive appearance. Bettie Page saw the film at Hugh Heffner's (now eighty-three) with the producers there, but not the director, in case it would be difficult if she did not like it. Apparently, she liked until the official investigation, which she found disturbing. Some beautiful costumes too. The idea of ​​the film started in 1993, but it was worth the wait. The portrait of her never seems to sound wrong in reference to all those pictures and film clips (terrible) that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting companion with Goodnight and Goodluck, but a much more enjoyable visualization!
