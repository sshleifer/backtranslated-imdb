An absolutely awesome show. The second season started where the first ended, with a lot of mystery. Suspense in most, if not all episodes and mysteries everywhere. One that made me think and think again. It's really amazing how the author can create all the connections, connect all the characters and combine all these elements to make sense of the characters in the series. Never fail to excite and I look forward to the new season. Hope that more secrets will be revealed and, at the same time, more mystery to solve. Good distribution choice also for this show, perfectly suited to the characters. Really can not wait to finally discover the secret. Let's hope that all the hype will not spoil the end.
