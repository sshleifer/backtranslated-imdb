Edmund Burke said that "all that evil needs is for me to do nothing". Hollywood often gives us garbage because not many families will see quality movies. This film was an edifying story of the loss and restoration of faith. He had no violence, no lubricity, and did not deserve a PG rating. The western landscape was well filmed and some of the views were breathtaking. The actors were a little young for their roles, but otherwise credible and talented. The music score was too loud, and in some places drowned the dialogue completely. I am rarely surprised by the end of the film, but this one pleasantly surprised me. Sometimes the good ones win, and they earn by honest efforts. We loved the movie and the message and recommend it to the whole family.
