This film in many ways resembles "State Enemy" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, as we have an innocent (black) man pursued by the "government" with all the modern technology known to man. Usually, when the scenario is copied in this way, the result is a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course, I love everything David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not right, but there were more good things about this movie than that. The main character, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant and the story was filled with great extras such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), however, pissed off most of the role. He is so misplaced that he makes jokes without public sympathy. Or not to start, what is strange is that it develops a little on you (and on his followers too!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but I was surprised by a good solid action movie with comedy elements. 7/10
