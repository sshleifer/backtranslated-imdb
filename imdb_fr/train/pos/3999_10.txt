I am embarrassed to say that "Mother" missed me when it was in theaters. I saw it tonight on DVD. I gave him 10 votes, one of the few I gave here. This independent English is filmed with as much care and quality. It attracted me tirelessly. The story, discreet and purely human, is brutally honest and absolutely absorbing, thanks to the play of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is beautiful. The score is wired to the plot. The story is epic, brilliantly dressed by the writer Hanif Kureishi in banal lives. This story tackles big problems with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of these big issues are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards, despite many appointments. It's simply one of my favorite movies of all time.
