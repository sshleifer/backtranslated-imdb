... but I still enjoyed this show. I read some of the comments that previous reviewers had about this show, and I have a hard time completely erasing all the criticisms that came to my head (except for one: that the show was out of date; was NOTHING, but bland). Many things that contradict people about this show are about money: pretentious; strength; exceeded; desperate for attention; self-satisfied; boring story always present. But what do you know? I really like that. It was different, it was original, it was really, really TRIED; and that made up for all the inconveniences. The series was brilliant, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it was once a week, I could watch it once a week and look forward and enjoy it. I will cry his disappearance. But I guess nobody will bring him back to life.
