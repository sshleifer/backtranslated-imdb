I'm not usually in a specific show (except The OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey, I'm 20!), But I'm not kidding, after an episode of Reunion, I became addicted . <br /> <br /> I can not even say how much I was disappointed by the time difference between Bush's speech and Bush's speech last night, because I could not wait to see the episode of 1987, which will be broadcast next Thursday. Again, this conflict was disadvantageous because, as a new show, he had to create an audience and the postponement of the second episode of a week cancels the momentum. <br /> <br /> That said, television does not always have to be Emmy worthy to be nice. I do not expect Reunion to win an award, but I think it will catch my attention all season. Have you ever watched the first episodes of a beloved show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you got hooked. Character building takes a while. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​an episode for each year is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other show that I can remember having done something similar is 24, each episode lasts an hour ... and having a year full of events is more realistic than a busy day! Please give this show a shot. Relax on the art form ... it's just TV!
