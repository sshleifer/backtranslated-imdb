Although structured in a completely different way from Tim Krabb√©'s book "The Vanishing" (Spoorloos), he has the same general feeling, except that Koolhoven's style is less professional and more lyrical. The beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is at the end. A surprising emotional end. As you have read in several magazines, there is sex in the film, but everything is done very well. Never explicit, but with a lot of warmth and sometimes even humor. It's too bad that American films can not be as open and honest as this one. Where Dutch films tend to go beyond the limit, "De Grot" always stays within the limits of good taste. 'De Grot' tells an incredible story spanning more than 30 years. When you leave the cinema, you will be moved. What can we ask for more than one movie? Anyway, this movie even gives more ....
