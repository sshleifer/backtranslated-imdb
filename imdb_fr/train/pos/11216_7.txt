The story is extremely unique. These are the two pilots who save the Earth from extraterrestrial beings, but they have to use a special speed that allows everything around them to age quickly. . <br /> <br /> The end could have been fantastic. She started on a total bearish note and left a real mark, but she ended up on a super happy Disney note and pissed me off VERY badly. <br /> <The animation is decent for 89 but can not compare to today.I also heard a lot complain about the nudity of nudity.I found it was a little decent.The Nudity for the most part was justified except in episode 2 where there was an excess. <br /> <br /> Overall, it deserves a look but the end prevents it from being a classic.
