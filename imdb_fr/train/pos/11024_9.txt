This movie is just great. It's fun from start to finish, you'll always be at the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In my opinion, this movie is very underrated by critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly into the role of trained mountain rescuer, Gabe Walker. With him, Michael Rooker makes a beautiful appearance as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen of him as a bad guy. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the film takes place in the mountains with a lot of villains gives way to a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Awesome movie!
