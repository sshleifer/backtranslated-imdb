When a patient with pneumonic plague (a variant of bubonic plague), Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark), a US Public Health Officer, immediately quarantines all the people he knows how to be near the body. Unfortunately, the murderer was right in this situation and there is a good chance that the killer will begin to spread the plague, leading to an epidemic. Enter police captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to find the killer as quickly as possible and avoid a possible national disaster. <br /> <br /> While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly blurred and a little too sprawling (which is why I reduced the score to eight). This ranges from black gangster types to medical disaster, police procedure, thriller and even romance. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of director Elia Kazan, but to say it is a bit misleading. Kazan is the responsible leader of such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all. This film is anterior to these, but Kazan said he was already "unattached" by the studio. Taking this freedom too far may partly explain the spread. The film takes place in New Orleans, a city where Kazan "wandered ... day and night, so I knew it." He wanted to exploit the environment. "It's so great and colorful, I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints - all of New Orleans." <br /> <br /> Kazan handles every kind of Panic in the Streets well, but they can be connected better. The film would have benefited from staying with one or two of his moods. Sprawl in terms of decor would have always worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories written by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Cold". <br /> <br /> The gangster movie, which ends in thriller territory with a long chase scene near the end of the film, is probably the highlight. Unsurprisingly, Kazan said he thought the bad guys were "more colorful - I've never had a lot of affection for good guys anyway, I do not like Puritans." A close second is the only material that addresses the "panic" of the title - the discovery of the plague and attempts to track down the exposed people, inoculate them and contain the disease. Although there is a lot of suspense during these two "ambiances", most of the film is also a fairly simple drama, with a more typical stimulation of this kind. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is excellent. The stylistic difference of many modern films could not be more pronounced. He is intelligent, delivered quickly and well stated by each character. Conflicts are not created by "stupid" decisions but by intelligent initiatives. the events and actions of the characters are more like a game of chess. When unusual positions are taken, such as the fact that Reed retains the plague in the newspapers, he gives relatively lengthy explanations for which his characters argue. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Kazan believed that "decency, religion, ethics and the middle class are killing us". This idea makes its way into the movie through the modifications made to the standard or the tolerances brought by the protagonists. For example, gangster leader Blackie (Jack Palance in his first role in the film) is offered a "get out of jail free" card if he cooperates to fight the plague. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are good, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue.
