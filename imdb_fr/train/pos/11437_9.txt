One of the best animated works less known. Although he uses the cutting-edge animation method (at "South Park") in the most sophisticated way, the real talent behind "Twice Upon a Time" lies in vocal characterizations, with Lorenzo Music ( TV Carlton "Rhoda") Woody Allen-ish Ralph-the-all-purpose-animal being the centerpiece. The sequence "accidental nightmare" is undoubtedly one of the best animations ever filmed.
