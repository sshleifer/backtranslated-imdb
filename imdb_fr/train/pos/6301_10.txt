I'm taking part in a filmmakers symposium and this film was shown after having already seen a bad quality film and participated in a 40-minute discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I found the hilarious movie in the right places and I loved the weird characters. They really grow on you in the movie.
