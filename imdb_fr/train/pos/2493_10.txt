Typical comedy of the 90s, situational comedy similar to our modern music "My family". Thatcher being at the pinnacle of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for all she can. "Bloody Thatcher" can be shared with most of us. David, the typical teenager, cutting brains with bread knives, Jenny, the teenage boy in a bad mood, only interested in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben work as much as possible to keep their families afloat in the economic climate of the early 90s. Certainly, the first two series have not had the same success as the last. However, Series 3 starts with more laughs than I want to count. overall, this show did not have the best viewing hours and should have lasted a little longer. Obviously, they could not have continued after Gary Olsen's death, but I think they should get rid of "catherine Tate", "office", "little Brittany" and bring back the classics!
