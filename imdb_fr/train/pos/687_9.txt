It's a very entertaining film, given the budget and its length. The plot is almost never addressed in the world of cinema, so it also brought a sense of novelty. The acting was excellent (P'z to Dom) and the cinematography was also very well done. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves thrillers, it will not disappoint!
