The fear of a black hat is a hilarious parody of hip-hop culture. It's as funny as This Is Spinal Tap, if not funnier. The actors are incredible and the style of the documentary is superb. Mark Christopher Lawrence is an extraordinary talent that should be featured in many more movies. This film is a true cult classic!
