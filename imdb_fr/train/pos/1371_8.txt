This film is a charming and light look on both sides of where the rave scene "club kid" mixes with the world of art, music and performance New York (with a cameo). the ubiquitous Miss Bunny). This is the "Trilogy of the Flame Song" for gifted girls after adolescence. "This girl" for our millennium displeased and touched. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is fast and fun, and Parker Posey's client deserves - if not an Academy Award, at least - a "wave" of kudos in the stadiums. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on Miss Posey's very elegant platform heels, and it is perfectly projected. Like a lot of his acting work, he may not be very deep, he's often self-referential and, well, posey ... but it all works. She is a talented actress, an incredible artist, and this film is entertaining, she wears it on her shoulders like a fake leopard-print wrap and never lets it fall to the ground. <br /> Mary is a superficial party fashionista who has nothing to envy to designer clothes in a friend's closet or to date someone else's boyfriend. More deeply, it is about the story of a girl and her girlfriends who are carefree in every sense of the word, including about other people; and the learning process that caring is necessary for life. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully crafted, witty, and the only disappointing representation is that of the aunt, in a role far too one-dimensional and heavy-handed; a more nuanced performance of her would have deepened the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... it's comedy. A surprisingly deep role, which gives this film a substance and a vision of the world, is the boyfriend seller of fallafel. We should all be so lucky ... is he the one for Mary? or whoever goes? <br /> <br /> I consider this as an 8, because it's not a big moment in the film's history, it's not a classic, and it's not a great art (which becomes more and more rich and richer at proofreading). Like Susan's "desperate search," he represents something very true about his period, but may become useless over time. Still, it has everything an entertaining movie needs and deserves to be viewed many times, just for clothes!
