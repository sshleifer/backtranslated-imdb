This film shows people in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. This shows people humiliating other peoples and cruel to other peoples. This shows the inability of people to communicate or talk with others. <br /> <br /> During the screening, I saw people leaving in the middle because they could not watch the movie anymore. And rightly so. Because the movie is not easy to watch. There is a very depressing message and there is no moment of pity in the film. It is a very cruel film, for all tastes. You can not talk about the fun terms of this movie. It squeezes your throat and never lets you go, and in the end, you just feel out of breath because of its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not "recommend" or "do not recommend" this movie. You should make up your mind based on what I said earlier. Just know that this is not a classic film and that it does not suit all tastes.
