I thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics think. Although his plot is confusing, it does not interfere much with your understanding of the film. That being said, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, then this is probably not the film that suits you. I thought all the actors in the movie were exceptional. Each character has his own funny moments and the Tribeca Film Festival crowd made fun of everything. I thought that satire was a little exaggerated in a particular area, but it was done intentionally. John Cusack is right that even if it happens in the future, it really makes you see the present.
