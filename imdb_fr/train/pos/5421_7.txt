"In the sunny climate of India, where I spent my time as a soldier in the service of Her Majesty the Queen ..." continues the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal foundation on which the film "Gunga Din" rests. If you're lucky enough to watch this legendary classic, you'll enjoy the movies as they use them. for the greatest pleasure. From the screenplay of the established novelist and poet, this is the story of a humble Indian named Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who worked as a "regimental animal" during the British occupation of India in the 18th century. His greatest wish is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of a British contingent of the Calvary threatened with death by a notorious bloody Kali cult called the "Thuggee". Three soldiers in particular stand out in this company for their courage and camaraderie. Cary Grant plays Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Next, Victor McLaglen is the brave Sgt. MacChesney and finally, there is the flamboyant Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three, along with their fellow soldiers, are surrounded by a cluster of mountain aliens led by their fanatical leader called the "guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the midst of the chaos of war is the brave water boy who hopes to gain a place in the army by playing a bugle he has found. A solid story for an old black and white movie that needs little fanfare for those looking to enjoy a classic. ****
