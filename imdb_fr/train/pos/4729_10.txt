A troubled actor finds that the best way to break into Hollywood is to start breaking the competition. But what makes Break Leg a real gem is the sardonic look on the existence of the actor wrestling (and not so much) in Los Angeles. This brings us into this world with an irony and an effortless spirit. He also has a neat look and a very skillful direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that does not compromise its production values. The writing is tight, the dialogue of the first order. Cassini is an actor and the role really shows his talents. The culminating scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic and can become one of the hottest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it during an advanced screening and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and was delighted with it afterwards.
