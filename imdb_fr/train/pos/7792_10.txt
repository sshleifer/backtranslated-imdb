In shit shit that Hollywood (and others) continue to emit, it's one of those rough diamonds. A simple little movie, very funny and that leaves you the feeling that you do not lose an hour and a half of your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I had never really been a fan or had never noticed her before, but seeing her first performance convinced me that she is extremely talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a mission in a college class for me, so I was skeptical, I do not care. I said to myself, "Oh, my boy, idiotic or feminine films that denigrate men ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing the many relevant themes, I will simply say that if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and check it. Sometimes the simplest and most concrete films are the best, and this one is excellent.
