The German medieval saga of Fritz Lang continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband, Siegfried. King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gives birth to a child and invites her brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huns must kil Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We are witnessing a huge battle for life. and death begins, and it sets fire to all the place. Finally, Hagen died, as did Kriemhild. These films deal with great themes, such as revenge and eternal love. Of course, we later saw better films made from these subjects, but it was one of the first.
