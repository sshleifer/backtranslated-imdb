I have seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something I like! <br /> <br /> Sci-fi movies from the 1950s in the United States were pretty much mixed: they were either cleverly made and / or provocative or cheap and laughable. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in this rarity for the genre, the color. <br /> <br /> She also had a head start with the screenplay - although Shakespeare may not have recognized it, it was based on its timelessness. play and thus ensure a certain longevity if done well. <br /> <br /> It's the story of the murderous identity of a man magnificently artificially magnified by machines that remained a dead race lit 200,000 years ago. Along the way, the plot is full of stereotypes of the 50s and corn so pure that you sometimes wonder why you look at it but still do it. This love triangle thing ... yuck! The Disney caricature is still good, and the backgrounds of caricatures straight out of Galaxy magazine covers, etc., look good even after 50 years. Robbie driving the car off into the desert is really funny! <br /> <br /> In total, with all the flaws, the best of the kind, we should be grateful for the survival of this blank footprint.
