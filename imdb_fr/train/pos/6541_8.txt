At the age of 40, I'm not close to the demographics of Nancy Drew, but I was pleasantly surprised by this afternoon's movie. so, I could tell, was the pair of sixty-six silver-haired ladies in the row of me. The old man who left the theater right in front of me praised the film in front of the usher of twenty years (who said he saw the film the day before and liked it). <br /> <br /> To know more The point, however: in the row right in front of me, there were nine - count them, nine girls of ten years lined up next to each other, going from pop -corn and hot dogs and sweets both ways and laughing through the previews. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, they quickly settled down to watch .... <br /> <br /> .... and did not even seem to have the shot of Lightning until the closing credits began to roll. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; she does not quite pay for her high school side-tricks, she is not confident enough in her own tone, and her hooligans are just a bit too distant to be sometimes inept at criticism. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot is articulated quite well and it skilfully sits between the sins of excess cheese and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts wears the film with surprising grace - despite the superb timing of Josh Flitter, it's Roberts' film, and she does it beautifully. Nancy Drew is the direct ancestor of Veronica Mars, of Kristen Bell, and the film is also a linear descendant of Jodie Foster's "Candleshoe", a young and underrated. <br /> <br /> On the current market, it is a rarity: family film that respects the intelligence of its viewers. As such, it will not please everyone - but for what it is, it's the best film of its kind in decades.
