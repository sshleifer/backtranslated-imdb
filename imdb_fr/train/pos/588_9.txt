I saw all the films made by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Crosses It, Redford displays the lyrical romance and visual splendor of Montana's high rocky mountains as a nineteenth-century landscape inspired by Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film is the love of the visual and the text with the text of the author Norman Maclean, as well as the superb photographic work of Phillippe Rousselot (The kiss of Snake, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> The cast of Redford is perfect. Tom Skerritt is Reverend MacLean, whose methods of education include fly fishing and the Bible. Brenda Blythen, the mother, and her sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt, create a family whose interactions reflect the same issues as growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will bind them forever. It is the relationships between men, the father and the sons, the brothers and their wives with the outside world that found A River Runs through It on a vein of stories that is missing in many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> What makes these relationships special is Redford's focus on the language spoken in dialogue. This is a literary script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when paired with the beautiful rivers and mountains of Montana. The words and the bet are equal to the performances of a casting that goes up to their material. While the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem like a strange tool for centering a story, it is not so unlikely in the hands of Redford management. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler life deserves to be revisited again and again.
