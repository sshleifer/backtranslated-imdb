In our home, we are huge fans of Christmas carols and look at almost every version, including old Reginald Owen of 1938 and modern Patrick Stewart of 1999. Our favorite is the classic black and white of 1951, because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and its conversion set the most authentic tone. However, this 1984 interpretation has its own merits and is a charming and entertaining story, generally faithful to Dickens' novel. (See my comments on the other adaptations of the film, if you're interested.) <br /> <br /> First, George C. Scott can certainly seem rather sober and does not make a bad Scrooge. I love his favorites, his long coat and his hat. He cuts the most beautiful fashion figure of the lot and a pretty handsome man. However, it sometimes seems that Scott appreciates his role of Scrooge a bit too much and that he does not take it as seriously as he should! <br /> <br /> This interpretation offers the best Christmas atmosphere, optimistic and optimistic. One way or another, you know this story will end well. Filmed in the city of Shrewsbury, England, it just looks very British. The film has a beautiful musical score, with wonderful singing music in all relevant parts of the tale. Sometimes I could almost feel the chestnuts grilling and the pudding singing in the copper! <br /> <br /> Marley's anxious ghost (with her marvelous drop-jaw scene) and the three spirits are all pretty convincing. Christmas Past is a charming ethereal lady, the Christmas gift is wonderfully giant and jovial, Christmas Yet To Come is wrapped and dark as always. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, a little silent and sinister, not as happy and warm as he should be. I love the nephew's wife, whom they named Janet, with her beautiful vintage hairstyle. Instead of bluffing the blind, they concocted a game called Similes for the nephew's Christmas dinner, which is a cute little touch, Scrooge coming into the spirit of the thing. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their Christmas dinners are a little lean (although much appreciated), with Bob (David Warner) very friendly and suffering in his scarf. Ms. Cratchit is charmingly portrayed by Susannah York, who also played with George C. Scott in Jane Eyre's beautiful adaptation in 1970. Above all, this version undoubtedly has the best Tiny Tim, not only a lovely and endearing little boy, but sickly. With these dark circles under the eyes, the fragile little thing does not seem to be able to survive on time! <br /> <br /> This is a delightful and comforting version of the classic holiday. With its festive atmosphere, it is sure to put you in the spirit of the season.
