Not having read Nabokov and not knowing anything about chess, I could only see "La DÃ©fense Loujine" like a movie. <br /> <br /> It works really well as one of my favorite genres "Romanesque sports". "In Search of Bobby Fischer" shows how difficult mental work can be, requiring thought, preparation, endurance and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the chessboard, as alternative games are to be expected. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the feminist director Maureen Gorris ("Antonia"), Emily Watson with big blue eyes is gradually strengthened through her transformative relationship with the intense and rather distracted chess genius of John Turturro. <br /> <br /> The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written on the 27/05/2001)
