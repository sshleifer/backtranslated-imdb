Tiempo de valientes is a very funny action comedy. After his great film titled El Fondo del Mar and the spectacular TV show Los Simuladores, Damian Szifron has made another fantastic film. Tiempo de valientes watches, at times, a movie made in Hollywood .Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and here they have great performances. The film is very funny and fun and it has great moments.Tiempo de valientes is a very funny action comedy that I totally recommend if you want to have a good and I have to congratulate Szifron for all the talent he has . <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
