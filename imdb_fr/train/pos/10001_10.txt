Brilliant on-action by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and the love scenes in the clothing warehouse are unmatched. Corn on the face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The grip on the avocados is also superb. After being accused of being a returner, selling his boss and being dishonest, Pepto Bolt's lawyer shrugs indifferently: "I am a lawyer," he says. Three funny words Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite of the last show of Larry Sanders, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malicious than usual. The scene of the hospital and the homeless people invading a demolition site are classics of all time. Look for the leg scene and the two big diggers who are fighting (one bleeds). This film improves every time I see it (which is quite often).
