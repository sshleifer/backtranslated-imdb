It's a very good action / drama / slightly historical movie. <br /> <br /> The basic story is Rob Roy's loan of 1,000 pounds, his robbery and the problems he indirectly causes to his family. his clan men. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a villain and an amazing character in this story. Brutally cold and if you look at his face, he seems to be able to close his eyes and look completely perverted. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think the authors used the word "honor" 1 time too often. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well played and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the game of the sword very realistic, but not too gore. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a classic.
