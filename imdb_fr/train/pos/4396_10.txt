I really enjoyed the details of the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (misspelled) and Jewel have been outstanding in their supporting roles. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire gave as perfect a performance as ever, when he had to amputate the arm of his best friend, knowing that he would die without the intervention. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with good dialect framing to capture the Southern accent incredibly. <br /> <br /> Why has this movie been swept away by Hollywood promoters? I can only imagine it. I have strong suspicions. Which makes it all the more attractive to me. I gave a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> Film completely neglected. Rent it or buy it and give it all your attention for a few hours, then judge.
