Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and this is clearly explained in his first horror movie 'Creep'. "Creep", although slightly informative, is worthy of a true gore classic. A little less brilliant than the recent American horrors (remake of Amityville Horror, remake of House of Wax). This dark and macabre tale follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and abandoned railways. try to flee a deadly attacker. Although bad reviews have announced this film, I am convinced that, with a tight budget and a British production of the director for the first time, Smith, "Creep" really bears his name. It offers a quick bloody action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too quickly, because the story is uneven in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best character response to the end I've seen for a long time. "Creep" delivers scenes that are definitely nightmares.
