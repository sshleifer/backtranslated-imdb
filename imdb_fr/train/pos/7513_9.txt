"The Notorious Bettie's Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> With: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathairn > <br /> Evaluation of the MPAA: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some languages) <br /> <br /> It seems that every celebrity gets a biopic on his life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, the biopics are very chic right now. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest of these to be released on DVD. This is Bettie Page, the most famous model in the world pinup. She was shot mainly in black and white with some color extracts. Unlike "Ray," "Walk the Line," and "Finding Neverland," this movie will not be watching at the Oscars this year. This film lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the most dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or simply suggested. That does not mean it's a bad movie, though. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a completely entertaining and fulfilling film - a solid work of cinema. This film puts more emphasis on Page's exciting career and on the dividing line between sexuality and pornography. It is filmed with fervor and care and the direction of Mary Harron captures the aspect of the period that only dream most filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know her as an icon or as a porn star, you know her. She is a woman who has had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that time. Now, most people know it as one of America's first sexual symbols - a legend for many models, especially those of Playboy and other adult magazines. She was living at a time when showing an inch of flesh underneath the trash could make someone stop, and Page and bondage photos were the best way to push the American public into a tumult. In fact, the photos opened a full-fledged Senate inquiry into common decency and the difference between harmless movies and porn. <br /> <br /> The performances of "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol who stands out. His performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that when she was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. His name is not the one that immediately jumps in my mind when I think of great performances. Now it's OK. She completely accepted the role and attracted me with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance. David Strathairn is fresh out of last year's "Good Night, and Good Luck", in which he gave one of the best performances of 2005. Here, he gives yet another great performance - even if he is slightly underused. I was shocked to see how limited his projection time was, but quality rather than quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only performance I saw from Lili Taylor was "The Haunting" (1999). While most people have ignored the film, I found it to be a nice horror movie, if not completely superficial, and I've always thought Taylor was perfectly credible as Nell. emotionally upset. Here, Taylor gives yet another credible performance. It gives a very moderate performance and offers the perfect performance to complete that of Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> Once everything was said and done, I realized that "The Notorious Bettie Page" can not be compared to other biopics, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the line ". It's incomparable because it tells the story of a woman and her career from beginning to end. His personal life is briefly mentioned, but it is really his impact on the world that becomes the climax. We watch the film knowing that Page will eventually reveal everything and we know the impact of his decisions, but we rarely show the impact they will have on his personal life. She is a woman who has never looked back and can constantly reinvent herself. After all, she was an adult model turned Christian missionary. This film does not dramatize anything. It could have included fictitious moments of bloody pages and asking God to forgive him. He could have shown that Page ran and screamed through the rain trying to escape the ghosts of his past - and yet that's not the case. "The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story and is rare by today's standards. Fortunately, it's quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing film with an absolutely incredible cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9/10 (A)
