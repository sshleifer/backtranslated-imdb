I did not know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly', but I loved it. It was dark, dramatic and striking. It also seemed very authentic, I felt like I was transported in the 1800s. I was never a big fan of Heath Ledger, I only saw it in teen movies but he is quite convincing in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how a very lively boy has become Australia's most notorious killer. Naomi Watts is excellent in a supportive role as a lover of Kelly's society. Highly recommended - and it's an Australian!
