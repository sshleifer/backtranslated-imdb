I loved this film. you must respect dwarves dressed in tiny martians. Granted, the story may have been thin at times, but you can not forget how it was done. I used to watch this again and again when I was 8 years old. It's a children's movie, and in addition, it contains some of the greatest quotes of all time. Blanzee's "Home on the Range" rendering is great. <br /> <br /> very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
