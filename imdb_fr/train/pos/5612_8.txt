In Paris, the timid and insecure bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an old bathroom-free apartment where the former tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange) was. The host concierge (Shelley Winters) and the hard owner, Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas), set strict rules of behavior and Trekovsky feels dominated by his neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone at the hospital and befriends his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that her owner and her neighbors are preparing a ploy to force her to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "The Tenant" is a disturbing and terrifying tale of paranoia and illusion. The story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the solitary Trelkovsky slowly develop in a nightmarish atmosphere in the macabre location of his apartment, and what happens is totally unpredictable. The performances are impressive and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("The tenant")
