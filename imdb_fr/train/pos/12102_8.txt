That starts a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a reporter ... Poe bets that the man can not spend a whole night in a scary castle. Of course he can, but will he come out unscathed? Hard to say with all those strange people who are not supposed to be there, including the iced Barbara Steele. It is a rather strange film in that the presentation is both in French and in English and alternates several times. This may be done because pieces of dialogue have been lost? It is also rather dark and claustrophobic, in that we do not see much beyond a small circle of light generated by candles and others, in addition to a sensation of terror and imminent misery at all. moment. This version (on Synapse) is also uncensored and I wondered what could be censored in a 1964 film until I see the scene of topless, I guess that may be so. Overall, it's pretty good and dark black and white. Barbara Steele definitely makes the film too. 8 out of 10
