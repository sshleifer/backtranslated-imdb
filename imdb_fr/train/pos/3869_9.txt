I saw the film at the Viennale a few years ago, where the public loved it. I liked it too, Summer Phoenix's performance always haunts me, so I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in London around 1900, when a young Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She is desperately trying to become one, but it is not until a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage that she has talent, that she connects with the audience and that she becomes a human being stronger. <br /> <br /> There have been some critics, where her performance has been broken, they accused her of being deaf, unable to give life to her character. I think that's his forte, that's exactly what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes the brave decision to make Esther a rather boring girl. So, his transformation at the end is more powerful than it would have been otherwise. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is excellent, the images of London at the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how uncomfortable life was at the time. <br /> <br /> The only fault in my opinion is the length of the film, you lose contact with the characters, after all, it's all about finding the actor in yourself, he does not there are no dramatic actions in the film. Phoenix deserves that we do not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
