The story of the burglar of Baghdad (as it was formerly written) drew the filmmakers of Raoul Walsh in 1924, who interpreted Douglas Fairbanks in the first, made silent of "Thief of Baghdad", to less impressive attempts and most recent. The best part is the 1940s version, which in its day was a surprising and magical set of high quality special effects. These effects are still their charm. <br /> <br /> No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor film starring Sabu as the thief, Abu, John Justin in the dreamy fallen monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez. like the beautiful princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the demonic vizier, Jaffar, played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genius is skillfully interpreted by Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad is deposed by Jaffar and later arrested by this treacherous serpent, he and his son Abu suffer clearly incapacitating fates. Ahmad is blind and Abu becomes an adorable mutt. Their adventures through the beautifully decorated Hollywood backlots are fun, but the special effects make this film effective. <br /> <br /> Two men were responsible for everything from the magic flying carpet to the gigantic genie coming out of the bottle with a whirlwind-like black whirlwind: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, realized the special effects of the 1961 version of this film.The two men had a long and distinguished career in technical magic.) <br /> <br /> Duprez is incredibly charming while he is hardly called to play seriously. Justin's Ahmad projects an animated but dreamy romanticism, free from any erotic impulse. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he is very good. For a film intended for both children and adults, there is a lot of violence but no bloodshed. Yet, I do not think children under eight should see "The thief of Baghdad". <br /> <br /> This film periodically appears on television, but today, my teenage son and I have seen in a theater the young people present. It was great to see children fascinated by computers in a well-to-do community, responding with cheers and applause to special effects that must be primitive to them. <br /> <br /> "The thief of Baghdad" is a classic Hollywood pre-war era where high production values ​​often resulted in significant and attractive releases in a sustainable manner. It's one of the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
