I first met this show during a six-month stay in Japan last year. I found it on the Internet when I was looking for subtitled dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away because she thought it was weird, but I found it delicious! Koyuki showed such contradictory character traits and Matsujun's spirit made my day every time I listened! I first saw it on "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked it a lot better in this area! <br /> <br /> Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed that they did not change much. a lot throughout the show. Their relationship has grown, but not really. Still, we all had a good time (even for Fukushima!).
