Some bad reviews here for that and I understand why, but consider it a low-budget movie for serial killer and you may get more than most others. <br /> <br /> I thought it worked somehow because I felt dirty then and wanted to take a long shower to have some success, did not I? <br /> <br /> I would say that the level of sleaze is quite appropriate to put you under the skin, even if you play maybe a role too uneven. David Hess is only in this brielfy so do not expect too much if you like Last House. <br /> <br /> Other than that - it's worth a look.
