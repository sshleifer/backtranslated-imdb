I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see him again as soon as it was over. The cast was excellent, the plot was exciting and entertaining, and it was just a nice movie! I would say it's one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls were very cute too, especially Denise Richards. She was very rich throughout the film and gave her character the OOMPH!
