I just watched Fido's World Preem at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed it immensely. Here we have a welcome retouch of a genre widely thought to have been invented (certainly "fleshed out" thoroughly and successfully) by George Romero. But it's a Canadian film by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, yes, I actually think it's better than "Shawn of the Dead". Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'Sun Ray, whom I suspect we will see much more in future feature films, are quite credible and above all perhaps more enjoyable. However, I must admit that I most loved the delightful turn played by Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor, Mr. Theopolis, playing essentially an animated version of Victor Van Dort's Corpse Bride (or, for those who saw the movie, would not it Want to read it better here as in Corpse Pride?) and, of course, in Billy Connolly, Scottish actor, in his role the least animated but the most upsetting as a main character. Think about it, he would not have had that role without Peter Stormare's commitments to Prison Break (as revealed in the Q & A after the Thursday night screening). I can not help but speculate that the writers had to draw a lot of Zombie 'Bub' from Day Of The Dead. I do not want to reveal details of the plot in a comment and I will not start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those graphical and gore-themed zombie movies you can count on from Romero. It's more like a film that will make you constantly laugh and, although (and I had to think about it, to be sure), there is a good deal of bleeding and violence, the delectable humor, so well reinforced by the surrealistic environment created by director Currie and co-writers greatly contributes to making this film a feature that should be rated PG-13. I urge you to go see this little gem Canuck. I will definitely buy the DVD once it is available by next summer.
