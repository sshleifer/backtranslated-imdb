I loved the story Somehow, a poster said there were no families like the one shown in this movie. Well maybe there should be. I thought everyone seemed really human and credible. What a top casting. What good music on the soundtrack. What a nice thing and what a nice thing, but especially, I will say two words to recommend this film. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> He really showed a beautiful, subtle depth that touched me. He really controlled as a widower who might have been a little too good at being a good father, at the price of negating his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did he act like a petulant donkey? Why, yes he did it. <br /> <br /> And you see, that's what was perfect in this movie. The actor who played this character made me believe that he felt something, and not just as if he felt something, and he perfectly conveyed to me how he felt and what he felt was denied. <br /> <br /> Absence of happiness. <br /> <br /> Absence of realization. <br /> <br /> Absence of love. <br /> <br /> Losing your love is painful beyond belief, and many people do it. I will never feel that again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him a rating of eight out of ten.
