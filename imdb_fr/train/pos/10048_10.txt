From time to time, the conversation turns into "favorite movies". I will mention Titanic and at least two people will sneer. I do not pay attention because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by this film. And they are too embarrassed now to admit it. <br /> <br /> I just saw Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the film had lost none of its power over the past five years. I cried again ... in all the same places. That brings me back to 1997 when I remember how a movie nobody thought was breaking became the most popular movie of all time. A film that burst in the public consciousness like no other movie I can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people will not even admit that they have benefited. Ladies and gentlemen, let's get right to the point - you do not look cool when you blame this movie. You look like a cynic out of touch. <br /> <br /> No film is perfect and it has some flaws. Part of the dialogue falls flat and part of the plot surrounding the two lovers meets a little too well. However, none of this distracts the film so much. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait to see him at Gangs of New York before calling him nothing more than a handsome boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The movie was really hers and she was doing it perfectly well. <br /> <br /> James Cameron has achieved what many thought was impossible by recreating a credible Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrible, as it was that night. How can anyone say that the effects were bad, it's beyond me. I was completely prisoner. <br /> <br /> This film is a memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving the port of Southampton. Rose and Jack in the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, right in front!" The screws that hang incredibly out of the ocean. The cries of the condemned after her fall. And that end that made even the strongest man in the theater cry. <br /> <br /> The music, which was also a victim of the film's success, was an essential ingredient. James Horner's score was just perfect. And the theme of love was beautiful and tragic. Too bad the pop version of Celine Dion had to destroy this piece of music for so many of them. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am a fan of the Titanic. As such, I took the opportunity to see the ship as we have never seen it - in all its beauty. Maybe watching it flow has affected me more than others because I have always had such an interest in the ship. However, I doubt that many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for telling this story to the masses in a way that has never belittled the tragedy. The film was shot with such humanity. <br /> <br /> Another critic says it better than ever: open your hearts to Titanic and you will not be disappointed.
