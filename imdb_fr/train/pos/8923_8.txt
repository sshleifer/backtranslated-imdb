The Blob is a classic sci-fi movie from the 1950s B drama. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) saw a meteorite hit the ground and when they went the look for, they met an old man with a strange job ... hanging on the arm. They take him to the doctor and then look for what happened. From there, the blob spreads, devouring everyone in its path. The special effects are fun, just like the story. There are many good things, like the cop playing chess on the radio with a cop in another district. This is not a masterpiece, but it occupies a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
