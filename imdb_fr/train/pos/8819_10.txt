This movie is really not so bad. But again, this kind of movie is right in my driveway. Of course, the sets are cheap, but they really have decent with what they had. <br /> <br /> If you like cheap, futuristic and post-apocalyptic movies, then you'll love this one !! I of course did! <br /> <br />
