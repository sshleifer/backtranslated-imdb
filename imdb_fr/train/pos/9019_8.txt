Not wishing to give anything here, I would simply say that this little technically excellent cop, perfectly played and exhilarating reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half of entertainment: it will entertain, surprise, perhaps annoying from time to time and almost certainly will shoot at heart, from time to time, approaching the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clich√©d or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommended. <br /> <br /> The comments of a previous user give 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for the exceptional performances of Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I totally agree ...
