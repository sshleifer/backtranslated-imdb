By God, I have not seen it for a long time. Probably about 18 years ago? <br /> <br /> The film teaches us everything about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally, a Disney style animation as well as human actors were made by Frank Capra, for the sake of Pete! <br /> <br /> I wonder if the very high production value is equivalent to what a film strip of information about the human body represents? But the children who will watch it will still learn: even now, I remember very well that Dr. Baxter was challenged by Hemo himself to name the common material that most resembles human blood, to which the Doctor has immediately answered "sea water".
