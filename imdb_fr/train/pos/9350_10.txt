let me tell you that I love Adam Sandler, watching reign over me, I paid particular attention to his acting <br /> <br /> when he raised his voice, I could not help but to think of Happy Gilmore screaming after a golf ball, then I come back while Adam Sandler sucks me <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that starts slowly at the beginning, with a wait of the emotion in every scene <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a good job and is no exception to the rule here, with some really great lines and is worthy of an Oscar in every film he <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler was amazing in many ways. Not only was this his most dramatic film / best movie played of his career. but I remember laughing at many parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> The secondary distribution was excellent also with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie because it has And some great dramatic and dramatic comedy scenes in New York. And a new respect for Adam Sandler if you have already doubted him or reassure yourself about the beauty of Don Cheadle.
