NYC, 2022: The greenhouse effect, the disappearance of the oceans, cruel unemployment and the scarcity of water, electricity and food ... and the population of New York has exceeded 40 million. It is a little gem of image, especially because a future with exhausted resources is a reality for us, citizens of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The first low-budget titles of this film are excellent: set to music, a low-tech tape-tape sequence consisting entirely of archival still images from the dawn of photography until 1973, portrays an intact American pastoral transforming itself into a polluted hell and populated in less than 2 minutes. In short and unambiguous, it's really memorable. Budgetary limits are also behind unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, in contradiction with the brilliant premise of history. The police station's footage looks like an episode of a television series of 1970s detectives, and the other interior sets are, at best, basic. The budget probably sought to "futurise" the Soylent Executive's "Chelsea West" apartment with state-of-the-art goodies, which means the other costumes are superficial, some clich√©s are strangely underpopulated, and day exteriors all seem to have been fired. smoke filter. <br /> <br /> The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of rare and expensive food perfectly sums up their society: they love real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple and the beef and we really feel that they appreciate the rich privileges of someone else. <br /> <br /> The decisive death scene of Robinson, in which his character is willingly trapped in a place called "Home", describes it immersed in images of the once magnificent flora and fauna of the world , as he remembered, contrasted nicely with the realization of Thorn's dawn that suspected that his future was bankrupt, among other horrors. <br /> <br /> This is a smart movie and its essential message. is as relevant today as it was in the early 1970s. Yes, I know we are not eating the dead yet, but with our longevity undermining resources, our spiraling poverty gap, global capitalism companies and the uncontrolled destruction of habitat leading to climate change, the sustainable prediction "Soylent Green" can be realized.
