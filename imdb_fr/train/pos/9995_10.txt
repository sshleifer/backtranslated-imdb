This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, fire lit and feet up. It does not require a lot of brain power to follow, so it's very good after a long day. I would say it's very unrealistic - if you're expecting something serious then do not worry, but it's a lot of fun. Just to think that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a shantytown for a while, then really enjoy it ... I would recommend it without hesitation.
