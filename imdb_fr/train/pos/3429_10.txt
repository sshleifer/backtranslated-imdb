I saw this movie in preview Friday (1/19) in Park City for Sundance and I was extremely moved. Sitting in a theater and hearing the anguished soldiers at first hand, it was almost more than I could bear. Others in the audience were also moved and, although we wanted to turn away from them, the least we could do was to testify before those men and women who shared their experience. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film, were present. Although they may be at home now, you can say that this war is still inside them and will probably always be. Whether you support the war or not, it is OUR duty to support the troops with something other than a sticker. See this movie!
