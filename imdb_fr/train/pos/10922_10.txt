When I was very young, on a local television channel, they broadcast kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays. Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Rage of Master, Tattoe Dragon and ... Five Deadly Venoms.I remember the day well. My dad and I had just had lunch at Burger King. We were going back We ran into the house and jumped on the couch, lit the scenery and moved it to 56. The usual intro of many kung fu clips back with the words Kung Fu Saturday on this one The title started under the title of the film. It said Five Deadly Venoms.So the movie started.I bit into my amused burger with the sequence of pre-credits. I loved this movie at the very minute.My favorite character Toad Venom.The plot was difficult to follow at this age but it was not what seduced me ... it was the fighting.The fighting was so ... amazin I'm I'm complaining every time an advertisement appeared and the 2 hours of the best movie I've ever seen came to an end.
