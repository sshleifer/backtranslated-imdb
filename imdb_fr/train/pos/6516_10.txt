Hello. I just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has too much time to devote to Wayyyyy. I need a life. I found the film with a striking resemblance to the broken mountain. I also found that I looked a lot like Jean Lafitte if he was white. besides, my favorite phrase in the whole movie was Mr. Petey's: "This baby can shoot a tamia eye more than 300 meters!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the film was the arrival of the British, and the drummer so devoted to his work, that he was beating to the death, as if this drum would end the war ... but it would not be. Well, that's all I want to say about this movie. Oh, one more thing..bonnie Brown is a bipolar physco crazy mood dangling BEEYOTCH. that's all.
