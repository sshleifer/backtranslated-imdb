Walter Matthau and George Burns work so well together. Willy's acidity with the perplexing Amnesiac Al is a heavenly mix. The scene when they find themselves in Willy's apartment is a jewel and the final scene completes the film to perfection. Walter Matthau gives a superb performance as a semi-retired irascible comedian as only he can, the intonation of the voice and exaggerated dramaturgy, associated with his general misunderstanding of what is happening, constitute a great characterization. The timing of George Burns is legendary and he has nowhere else been better than in this movie, his calm plumb with dry dry desert responses are unforgettable. Watch the scene towards the end when Al and his daughter ask something of the Spanish goalkeeper and the reaction of Al - inestimable.
