"The Godfather" of television, but aside from his cheers and gangster characters, the two do not look like. Tony Soprano is forced to consult a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families - in a family he is a loving and yet not so perfect father as his husband, and in the other family he is an unscrupulous sage. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problems actually stem from his mother Livia, suspected of having borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; however, Bracco and Marchand are not as well known for their equal and talented performance as the psychiatrist and the mother, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are known for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (from E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend. He is quite convincing and catchy. Chianese, the only recurring actor to have appeared in a Godfather movie, plays Tony's uncle and nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed the characters of Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay" but not remarkable (except for Iler's superb performance in the third to last episode, "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and exceed expectations, but the series is too strong for them to retain. Even if the show lasts more than six seasons, there is no more dull or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
