Yes, the archetype of a simple but inspiring film. The end when everyone in the stadium gets up and the audience raises the hand gives me a thrill every time I see it. It's just great. Joseph is wonderful as a lonely and sad kid who has been disappointed by anyone in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in magic and angels is funny and exhilarating. A beautiful family film with - I concede - a happy end rather cheesy. But hey, whatever, the film retains its basic quality through good acting and inspiring themes.
