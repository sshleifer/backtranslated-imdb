* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I start, let me say that I had the benefit of both seeing this film on the big screen and seeing the "authorized version" of this film, redone by Stephen King, himself, in 1997. <br /> <br /> These two advantages made me appreciate this version of "The Shining" even more. <br /> <br /> Say that I read Mr. King's book, "The Shining" many times over the years, and although I like this book and I'm a big fan of his work, the story of this story by Stanley Kubrick is much more convincing ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to transmit the terror of the psyche directly to the cinema. In the sense of the film AND the writing of the script itself, he acquired the title "Magus" beyond any question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The film world lost a great director when he died in 1999. Other notable achievements include: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A mechanical orange, 1971; 2001: an odyssey of space, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many others. <br /> <br /> The Torrences (Jack, Wendy, his wife and Danny, their son) live at the Overlook Hotel during the winter; Jack was hired as a guardian. He is responsible for the maintenance of the hotel during the months of heavy snow, until spring, when the Overlook reopens. It seems that there are many wealthy and jaded tourists flocking to the Colorado mountains for a summer getaway filled with snow. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive monument of architecture and staging. He lent to the atmosphere, having a dark atmosphere, but at the same time "welcoming", itself. The furniture and furniture were from all ages (late 70s-early 80s) and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant. This not only allows you to take advantage of the approach of the Overlook, but also to remind you how the hotel is isolated and isolated from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Wendy and Danny's characters was a blow. genius. You get all the history of their past, Danny's "imaginary friend," Tony, as well as Jack's alcoholism story, all of which have come into this beautiful and pretty introductory scene. It was not necessary to stretch the story for more than two hours of the film; obviously, Kubrick has seen this from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Closing day. Once again, the scenic drive to the mountains leading to the hotel (this time with his family), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious, while presenting a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The first visit through the Overlook is breathtaking, even if the "staff" is moving, you will have the opportunity to see the majestic fireplaces, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furniture, the dormant and moldings in architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even "the staff wing" is well designed and beautifully constructed. <br /> <br /> The labyrinth was beautiful, reminiscent of the labyrinth in which the Cretan Minotaur was the guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands at the labyrinth model and looks in the center, seeing Wendy and Danny enter is a magical moment. one who tells you right away, there are heavy energies in this house; there is something seriously wrong, which is already beginning. "I would not want to go unless I have at least an hour to find my way." (The hotel manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was sincere and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You could really believe that you were there at the hotel, going around the kitchen with Wendy and "Doc". Her explanation of "the brilliant" to Danny was very well delivered, as was her conversation with the child about Tony and the hotel. It was credible and sincere. <br /> <br /> The cutting and panning of the hotel itself, with the mountains behind it, the cold air swirling around it, the mist coming from the warm roof of this snow-covered hotel, adds so much a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. This also marks the point "halfway to hell", so to speak; turning in the film. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Wendy Torrence by Shelley Duvall was brilliant. (So, WHAT if she was playing Olive Oyl too ?! It just shows her wonderful diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the film on the big screen in 1980, I thought, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye also came out in 1980.) But I took this idea from the beginning of the film, it is brilliant.For this fiend, it's her best performance so far! (Although I loved her in "Roxanne" by Steve Martin, 1987.) Once Kubrick has established the pearly information that you, the viewer, must be in possession of: the past of the Torrence, the broken arm of Danny, Tony, the story of the The hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not "mental", but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general disposition of the Hotel, that you find in the first 3 sequences, the film does not cease to frighten you The two daughters of former goalkeeper Delbert Grady (the girls having appeared several times with Danny, first by the Tony's mate in the apartment, before the family left the hotel) were icons with which Danny could identify, and which he was afraid of, at the same time. They haunted (and haunted) themselves and showed Danny how and where they had been killed in a fairly graphic and material way. <br /> <br /> Tony de Kubrick was written as an assistant, as a spiritual guide to whom he acquired because his own father had almost torn his arm out of the body. He was ... "the little boy who lives in my mouth." He showed up at Danny's fingertip and spoke physically through Danny to talk to Danny. It's not like in the book, I realize, where Stephen King had expected Tony to be screening Danny as an older boy, trying to save his father. Kubrick left out that little twist and it made it more frightening when Tony "took ... Danny ... more." The idea that Danny's old character is projecting on himself is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> The scene "Woman in the shower", directed by Lia Beldan (about which I can not find any other generic) to have done anything before or since) as Young woman and Billie Gibson (who also seems to suffer from a lack of credits for earlier or later works), was alluringly odious and totally disgusting. It was dramatic and scary. Abominable and scary. When Nicholson looks in the mirror and sees it decompose under his hands; the look of terror on his face was so complete and REAL. <br /> <br /> Jack is fast on his journey from the alcoholic "jonesing" to a certifiable madman. The degradation of the mental state of his character is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's instant friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, the mentally ill, and drug addicts do) attests to his urgent need for the atmosphere in which Lloyd warns him; namely, alcohol ... "the hair of the dog that bit me." (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, at no cost to Jack. "The orders of the house." (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice word game. <br /> <br /> When Wendy finds that Jack's "storyline" is nothing but page after page of the same line typed over and over, although there are 8 or 9 styles of different creation. ..when he asks for shade, "How do you like it?" and Wendy turns and screams with the baseball bat in her hand ... is so poignant. This is the moment when she realizes how much the whole situation is ruined ... how bad Jack is ruined. It's very scary, dramatic and has a strong presence. That, added to Danny's visions of the hotel lobby that is filled with blood, imposed on the scene between Jack and Wendy and the conflicting end of this scene, makes it perhaps THE film's strongest scene. <br /> <br /> "REDRUM" scene. Sensational. What should I say? What mother would not be totally afraid to wake up seeing their troubled young son stand over them with a big knife, speaking of that scary little voice, exclaiming "REDRUM" several times? Even if it had no meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL. It was something that everyone could (and has) remembered. Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final assault on his family with an ax was perhaps one of the most frightening scenes in the history of cinema. His ad-libbed line, "Heeeeere's Johnny!" was a stroke of genius and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. He also enters the history of horror film. <br /> <br /> The end ..? The end of Kubrick was perfection. I felt that it ended well. No smarm, no moans, no silly end in tears for THIS film. Just perfection embodied. That's all I'm going to say on the subject of the end. <br /> <br /> Who cares what has been released ?! Look what Kubrick has put in it. Praise him, look at him, buy him. It's a horror classic, and for good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me, who am I * ... Take this film, assemble it in your Stephen King collection and take the 1997 "Authorized" version made by King and paste it in the section for children. That's where it belongs. .: This movie has been rated 9.98 by the Fiend :.
