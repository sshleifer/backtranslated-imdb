I'm really surprised that this movie is not rated better on IMDB. It's one of those movies that could easily miss out on someone, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really a class apart. Its setting and ethnic charm are things that people seem to take for granted. The cast alone makes it an almost perfect movie. Few movies in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's funny too. **** out of *****
