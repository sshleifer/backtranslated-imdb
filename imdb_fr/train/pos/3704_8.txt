Generally, it is difficult to evaluate these cut and glued films. Some segments can be quite good while others reduce the rating of the entire product. In this one, for example, the all-female scene in the doctor's office was quite exciting ... one of the best in this viewer's (limited) history. Then there is the segment of Asia ... the lady is always entertaining. And the story that binds everything was an interesting concept. The trading scene closing the offer is not bad either. Technically, production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
