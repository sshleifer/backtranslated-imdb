In 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg directed a moving and unforgettable story of an African-American girl Celie (lead role for Whoopi Goldberg), whose life is followed by hard times. The story begins in 1909, when Celie is only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. A widower watches Nettie but their father gives him Celie. This is the beginning of an era of horrific abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men and, in particular, as African-American women, their rights are below zero. Celie's story is a story of survival. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a masterpiece and an underrated Spielberg film. He should do more drama than "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are a good idea. <br /> <br /> The distribution is incredible. Whoopi Goldberg is best known as a delusional actress, but Celie's introductory role is a remarkable word that she can really draw from the heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly naughty "Sir". I have never seen him in such a perverse role. The talk show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as Sofia at the strong will. <br /> <br /> Attention! Get ready to have a number of tissues with you when you watch this movie. You can really connect to the story of the strong sorority. Especially if you have such close relationships with your brothers and sisters as me with my sister. <br /> <br /> We applaud Mr Spielberg!
