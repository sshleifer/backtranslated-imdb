It was one of the best episodes of all time. Constable Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car in '68. A dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin in the car after the shooting. His file is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a police officer. <br /> <br /> A more thorough investigation of him as a police officer and a human reveal a veteran involved in a forbidden love. This type of love was considered shameful and had to remain hidden at that time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the type of love that I personally support, he was still a policeman, a human being and should not have you killed for that. The soundtrack was excellent (allows me to watch the DVR), and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to highlight an object or give a particular feeling to a scene was particularly appealing. I'm going to watch this one in rehearsal!
