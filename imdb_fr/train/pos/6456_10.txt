My expectations were big enough for this film. Everyone I know who saw this movie in the cinema told me that everyone was in the credits because they were very touched. My expectations could not have been higher, nothing wonderful would have disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I was anything but disappointed by this movie. I liked the way he dealt with difficult topics without following the usual steps that a Hollywood film tends to include. In this film, the characters worked on problems they had encountered for decades, on prejudices, they learned to open up. But that was not easy, not just singing a song or two. It was painful, it took arguments, it took confrontations. It was like in real life. <br /> <br /> A scene that really struck me is one in which Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers. Her voice is charming and we could say that she was not synchronizing her lips with a previous recording during filming (which I often find in other films), she really sang with all her body and soul . You could feel what Gabriella was feeling in this scene. If this film had been shot in Hollywood, her song would probably have been sung towards the end, which would have pushed her husband to open his eyes and become aware of his mistakes, while allowing other villagers to achieve something. or two. Instead, he arrived at the halfway point and he did not bring any solutions. Her husband was not overwhelmed and did not realize what he was doing to her, and it did not seem to make anyone else in the village more open-minded. It was beautiful, it was pure and it was touching but it did not solve all its problems like magic. It seemed real to me, that's probably what would have happened in real life. For me, the whole film was like real life, nothing is carefully packaged, but all with a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find such a realistic film. <br /> <br /> Some things bothered me, but no movie is perfect. If you have not already done so, you should go to "Like Heaven" and be filled with a joy of life, a sense of hope and the feeling of being touched to a level that the films reach. rarely. You will be sad, pained, happy and a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir, there would be no more wars. After seeing this movie, I might have to agree.
