Directed in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai is one of the great films made by Welles after his return from relative exile for the production of Citizen Kane. Dark, dark and expressing some paranoia of the cold war, this film is a crime movie film noir. The cinematography of this film is filled with the characteristic features of Welles: strange angles, fast cuts, long pans and sinister lighting. The use of ambient street music is a precursor to Touch of Evil's incredible long opening, and the mysterious Chinese characters and Chinatown sequences can only be considered as Chinatown's inspiration in many ways. of Roman Polanski. Unfortunately, it is Welles' obsession with technical cinema that hurts this film in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> However, despite these criticisms, the story combined with great performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) make it a joy to watch. Orson Welles draws not only Irish brogue, but torn identities as an honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married at the time with Welles, breaks with her usual roles of sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions. Finally, the strange and bizarre portrait of Glenn Anders or the legal partner of Elsa's husbands is nothing short of classic!
