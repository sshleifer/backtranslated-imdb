I loved this movie, seen tonight on a big movie screen! The audience burst out laughing when they heard some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyable. <br /> <br /> As a singer and music director, I question some of Roby Keeler's voice in "By a Waterfall". "The voice was modulating and she was suddenly singing a lot lower, with a very soft voice that did not resemble Twitter's more serious, pewter-like voice, which she had used in all her other songs. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if this has been covered by another singer? It seems to me. I'd like to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
