This film is very good. A year and a half ago, I bought it on DVD. But first, I thought it was the original movie. I saw the series and it's a good movie, but here they put together "The Living Legend, part1 and 2" and "Fire in space". The same as in the first film, but with other episodes. But still, it's a very good movie. Only the end is strange (you do not see what happens with the Pegasus). But I still think it's good enough. The actors and the special effects were good. If you have not seen it, go see it. Featuring: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
