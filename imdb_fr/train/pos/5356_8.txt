Running Man is not a good movie, in fact it's a bit ridiculous. But that gives you what you want in an Arnie movie: action and entertainment. I do not see how anyone could appreciate this photo, it is so ridiculous and disproportionate that it almost makes fun of itself. By the way, it's probably one of the most cited Arnie films.
