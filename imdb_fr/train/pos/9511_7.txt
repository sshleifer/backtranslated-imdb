A bloody gangster story that unfolds in the years of the Great Depression. He tells us about another notorious hit-man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. In one way or another, this time, the story changes meaning: Mike fights to save his life and that of his last son, because the rest of his family was killed because of the dirty game of his own boss. He succeeds in revenge and secures an honorable future for his son, but is killed in the end. These stories never end well. <br /> <br /> The role of senior Mike Salliwan was played wonderfully by Tom Hanks, and the role of Mr. Rooney (the boss of the Mafia) was played by Paul Newman. The film makes a good impression and we hear the well-known phrase "We are robbing banks". This film still deserves to be watched, even if you could have hoped for something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty movie.
