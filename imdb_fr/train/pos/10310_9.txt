Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual nightmare. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is more sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this film is hardly sacred, but it is not sacrilegious, at least to a large extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I will give you the details. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays the role of Bruce Nolan, a journalist who struggles to succeed and feels very unhappy in his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and we can say from the start that they love each other, but the relationship is rather fragile. <br /> <br /> Next, Bruce tries the berth, only to get him stealthily stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously, that does not please him, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through television, in a comic manner and worthy of firing him. <br /> <br /> Many complaints and attacks against God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while, he is tired of calling, he reacts and goes to the building Omni Presents (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the boss, the electrician and the guardian of the building. I found this very amusing. God is the leader, the Holy Spirit is the electrician and Jesus Christ is the janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who makes everything work. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess left by the world. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about his meeting with God, but when God gives his powers to Bruce and gives him a chance to play God, he begins to believe a little. Ask yourself why. Enter the blatant abuse of powers for your personal benefit and to abuse your enemies. <br /> <br /> As it is Hollywood, it is obvious that Bruce finally takes over, learns his lesson and begins to use his powers for the good of the world. In the end, he asks God to remove it and pray that his will be done, not Bruce's. <br /> <br /> Regarding Jim Carrey, the movie is quite funny, and there are definitely some very entertaining movies. moments in it. The film is not a perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it's really a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite provocative and even provocative, and I congratulate Tom Shadyac for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> So while far from perfect, this is certainly a fun movie about popcorn with a thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Result: 3.5 out of 4 (deserve a view or two)
