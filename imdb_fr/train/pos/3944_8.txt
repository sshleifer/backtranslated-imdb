This little film was long on my list of "guardians". Do people realize how much the medical profession REALLY treats menopausal women and victims of psychological abuse (as well as the mentally retarded) !! !! All the pious Christian attitudes of that time were mortal to explore REAL emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged that women had feelings and emotional reactions as great as a man's? Think about that! The sensitivity of this film still holds me and I thank the director for capturing it through his eyes.
