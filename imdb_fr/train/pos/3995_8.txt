Kureishi did not really have the chance to see movies that justify the quality of his writing. Recently adapted travesty as "Intimacy" ruined the great writing. But the Mother surpasses all her previous incarnations, eclipsing even My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman defeats her widow by having a very carnal relationship with her emotionally weak daughter's boyfriend. The fact that you thought all this is to credit the quality of the game as the finite gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig, we have a crazy, gruff and grumpy anti-hero who prevents the public from ever asking why a young stallion would consider sleeping with a sagging grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film fails only by the feeble representation of peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust, it is a winner.
