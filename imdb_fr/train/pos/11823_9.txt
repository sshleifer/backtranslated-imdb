I really enjoyed taking this form to embody the character of Dick Tracy. This is a well-made product that uses modern technology to create a comic story filled with images. If you're a fan or have recently watched some of Dick Tracy's old black and white movies, then you're sure to be seduced by this interpretation. Pastel colors and larger-than-life characters, rendered in a meticulously authentic interpretation of the past, are just as entertaining as they should be. Personally, I find that the musical element of Madonna is a major element of this film. The CD that contains the music of this film is the one I have listened to over the years, it is so well done and played musically and adapted to that time. In my mind, the best moment of Madonna is both on the screen, but mostly musically. This is sure to bring out the "kid" in you.
