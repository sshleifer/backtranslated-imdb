For me, this review may contain spoilers, but I like to watch movies with no idea what will happen, so I think many other reviews of this movie contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again, and I must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie. Already. Already. Already. The actual translation, "The flutter of the butterfly's wings", is curiously not used as a translated title. I guess they thought most Americans would not know what the chaos theory is (except for those who have seen or read "Jurassic Park"). The film is based on the theory of chaos and how a single small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, all of which lead to a single event. The film is a whirlwind of wonderful causes and effects, as we follow the chain of chaos intermingling between several characters (about 20?). In a way, the end seems inevitable in spite of that, but if you think about it, it's a perfect end. Think of yourself, "what else had to be said"? It is at the same time a very courageous end. Too bad we had to go overseas for a jewel like this, but an end like this would NEVER come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
