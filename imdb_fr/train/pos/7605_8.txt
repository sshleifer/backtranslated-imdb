Lost is an extremely well done television series about some lost people on an island. there are so many twists and turns that you can not really decide who your favorite character is, a minute, so he's doing something to make him cool so he's about to do something so that the coolest is creates while the suspense builds up and by the time you find yourself to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week so see the next episode but it's worth the wait. The suspense, the action, the romance, the humor are at the rendezvous of the girls with bare breasts, but that's good, because it means that you can concentrate more on the history and that the history is what which counts above all. So if you like a good story and you like suspense, it's good, but I think it's probably better. (I have a review about that too that you could check.) I would give a good 8 out of 10 mainly because it's so unpredictable, you never know what will happen.
