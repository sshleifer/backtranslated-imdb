If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion", you should probably look at "The Tenant" because it's a similar concept, just with Polanski coming in and playing schizophrenic wacko. It's actually one of my favorite movies - the second one, after "Rosemary's Baby," of course - and a straightforward trip into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the old apartment of a victim of suicide. The other inhabitants of the building are all flaky and foolish to keep the noise level low - even the smallest "titter" becomes a big deal and Polanski, the star, becomes more and more paranoid and succumbs more and more malicious at the moment the film is moving on. He gets to the point where he gets dressed and behaves like the old tenant and you realize that it's only a matter of time before he decides to replay his fatal jump out the window ... The The film is a little slow and lags for Meanwhile, but if you've ever seen a film by Roman Polanski, know that it will end in beauty and that this film will not disappoint you. It is also better not to question the subtleties of the premise and to consider it as a descent into madness, because it is sometimes surrealistic. Polanski is very good as a shy and disturbed resident who in one way or another attracts the ever-illustrious Isabelle Adjani. We can also see him running in a trail, which is both disturbing and hilarious! Damn, it makes for an ugly chick! Thus, Polanski fans - who can really look beyond his thirty-year-old pedophile accusations - should appreciate "The Tenant" as an entertaining psychological excursion ...
