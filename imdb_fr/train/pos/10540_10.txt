I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination displayed, the visual interpretation of the scenario, the humor are constantly surprising. Both films are excellent and really wear the film. My advice would be not to even watch a trailer, just rent the movie and watch it without waiting. I rented it at blockbuster, so it's easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will appreciate it, but I think most people will have an opinion and it's always good, unless it's that "it was stupid". I loved this movie, you just do not see that kind of gem every day. This should become a cult favorite. Try, you may feel the same as me.
