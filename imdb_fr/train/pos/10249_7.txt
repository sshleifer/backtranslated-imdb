This is the first film of the Guinea Pig series. This is one of the most infamous films in the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally put myself in the place and get a copy of this well-known group of films. I bought the Guinea Pig Box and decided to look at the collection in order of release date. So I inserted that sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I read on the Internet and realizing the content of this movie, I expected my nerves to be tested thoroughly. This was ultimately not the case. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin to torture her in the hope of discovering the point of human breakdown and the time during which a human can tolerate pain. . <br /> <br /> It sounds like a sick movie, does not it? False. The film can not shock. It may be because I have become insensitive over the years because of my obsession with horror, but I think it's safe to say that any real gorehound could be done with ease. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, a person who is unfamiliar with this type of movie will probably be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images she sees on the screen. Although it did not succeed to shock me, the film contains rather violent and graphic scenes of violence. Including the tearing of nails, intestines thrown on an unconscious woman and a needle in the eyes. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think for the majority of gorehounds in this chart, you just have to get hold of a copy. of this movie for the novelty of it, but I suggest that for any newcomer in this type of movies, you make your way up to this one.
