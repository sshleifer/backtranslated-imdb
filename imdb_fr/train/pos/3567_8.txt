The world of Times Square by Damon Runyon, in New York, before Disneyfication, is at the base of this musical. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew cinema, directed this nostalgic homage to the "crossroads of the world" that shows us the underside of New York from the past. The music of Frank Loesser sounds good. We observe a magnificent cast of characters typical of the region. People on the periphery of society tend to move towards this area because of the lights, the action, the possibilities in this part of the city. This low-lying city lived on very intense street life. <br /> <br /> Some of the songs from the original production did not appear in the film. We do not know if that makes sense, but it's not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and change what has worked on the stage. This original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and we question the decision not to let Robert Alda, Sam Levene, and Isabel Bigley duplicate their original roles. They were distinguished actors who could have made an incredible contribution. <br /> <br /> The film, visually, is incredible. The look closely follows the fashion of the time. As for the cast of Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons, who are not known for his singing talent, seem to be working in the film. Sky Masterson is, after all, a man, who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different "look". Frank Sinatra is good like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, in the role of Sarah Brown, represents the Salvation Army woman who suddenly blossoms with the same man she is trying to save. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is a delight. She never ceases to marvel at Miss Adelaide, a woman with a heart of gold who is in love with Nathan Detroit. Mrs. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as a show girl who is wiser than she lets it appear. Stubby Kaye does a wonderful job in taking back his film Nicely Nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> This exceptional production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows, who made the film adaptation. Irene Sharaff's costumes set the right tone.
