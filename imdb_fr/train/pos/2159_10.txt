First of all, there is NO way the remake is so good, because the Japanese society is very different from ours and plays a major role in this film, as explained in the original story. This adds to the humor and warmth of this film. There are a multitude of different characters / personalities of support. Everyone contributes to make this film wonderful. This film is full of comedies that are by no means vulgar like most of today's "crude comedies". Still, he can still make you laugh out loud. In reality, in real life, you do not have the choice to work with who you go or to go to school with ... etc. This film really highlights this and shows that the natural good in humans can overcome minimal differences. Not to mention, this is an excellent sub-plot and a lot of humor. It's a story about dance that has a story and a good story about it. Some back stories are not misplaced, but actually support the main storyline. Really a well written film. The dance is great too. I'm a fan of all movies with dance, for this aspect. However, this film goes beyond any other film about dance, in the sense that it's a story first and it turns out that it's just about writing about the dance in Japanese society. Strongly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
