This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy who lived in a Cuban rural town the year of the Castro Revolution. It is a true work of love worthy of faith. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA FREE and CUBAN BLOOD are just attempts to market this action movie. DREAM OF JULIA is much more logical. It has more in common with European cinema than RAMBO and the revolution is only a drawback for the daily life and aspirations of everyone. This fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this period of Cuban history. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the voice-over narrator undermines the story, but the film compensated it unreservedly. extracts from Hollywood movies that say much more visually than the narrator could say. <br /> <br /> The comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and give rise to a fair game, because the wax film melancholy about the movies, but the loss is painful. of a lifestyle that goes beyond lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the movie JULIE, never seems to have an end.
