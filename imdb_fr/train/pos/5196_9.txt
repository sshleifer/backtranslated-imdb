Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and took into account the limitations of Rudy Ray Moore as an actor. It's a fun movie that's technically sound and played. The interpreters do not take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time, everyone is in the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and less stiff than he was in Dolemite. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and I highly recommend it. Like his first film, he speaks to a certain audience (I very much doubt that Mr. Moore has tried to expand his audience at this stage of his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
