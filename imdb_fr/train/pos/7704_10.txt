Some elements of this film are dated, of course. An all-white crew, for example. And like most Science Fiction before Star Wars, it tends to take too much time to admire. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, no movie has ever captured the flavor of Golden Age Science Fiction like this, using "electronic tones" to provide the musical score. Robbie the robot embodied the Asimov robots and inspired everything that followed, from C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> The plot, of course, is that of Shakespeare's "The Storm". Morbius is Prospero and an exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by intruders. It's a film about science fiction as an adult genre, maybe the first.
