It's an amazing movie and all actors and actresses and very good! Even if some actors and actresses were not very popular in the show business, they seemed to play since the age of one year! It was funny, disgusting and just a very good movie. In most areas, I did not know what would happen next! I was like I think it's going to happen, wait, I think it's going to happen. All age groups will love this movie! In some places I could not help but laugh, it was so funny, but in others I was totally disgusted and I could not believe what I was seeing! I will definitely see this movie again! It's one of those movies where it can not be boring. Whenever you see it's so suspenseful. I really recommend to see this movie !!
