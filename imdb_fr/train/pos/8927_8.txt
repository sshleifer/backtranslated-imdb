Clair Denis returns to his theme of separated fathers, men who follow their own happiness with determination, without worrying about the emotions felt by their family, but while Nénette and Boni from the previous film live in a narrow world of Marseille, our examination of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a place far from the French-Swiss border to the other side of the world, in Korea and Tahiti. Once again, the film begins halfway through, with Louis, in his sixties, facing a sick heart while trying to maintain a high level of fitness. We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence because his cabin is the place of smuggling and gunshots usual. Louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is in no hurry to move the action forward and we must patiently understand what Louis did with his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the border, including a son, Sidney (Grégoire Colin , almost unrecognizable with long hair and a mustache) who rejects him as a "crazy", presented as a devoted father of two children. There are many brief scenes that, although seemingly independent of each other, give an impression of Louis and his environment. Ms. Godard's camera work is exhilarating here. The dominant metaphor is Louis 'heart transplant, for which he travels to Korea, then to Tahiti, in search of another unrecovered son, and where Louis' new heart rejects him, just as Sidney rejected the old one. In Denis' film, we are used to presenting brief inexplicable scenes: Nénette riding Boni spoon feeding; a shot fired on Boni's father, then on Boni's shortest image shot in the head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a corpse with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney. The implication of the last two is a rejection, real or imagined, by a father, killing something indefinable in a son.
