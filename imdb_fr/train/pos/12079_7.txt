For those who think that Lady May Witty is the old lady of The Lady Vanishes of Hitchcock, kindly, slightly dapper, this film requires an adjustment. Here, she is anything but nice or beaten. Instead, his son, George Macready, is the madman. Do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes light up and no cushion of furniture in the house is safe. Now, we know what he has in mind for Nina Foch, trapped, if he manages to free herself from Mother's domineering hand. <br /> <br /> A tight little film about the woman in danger that keeps the suspense in the foreground. The scenario never departs from Foch's dilemma. She is trapped in a large and old Gothic house on the edge of a rough sea. They will kill her, but why? His situation makes no sense. The tension rises as she tries to escape from each other after the other, but even strangers appear against her. We begin to feel helpless and paranoid as the world turns away from it. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis has taken a big step towards cult status with this film, which is understandable. Then too, observe Foch subtly browse a range of emotions without ever doing too much. Witty also shines as a truly daunting matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it so she can just keep her wacko son in the row. My only reservation is the highlight which seems too artificial given the timing of the events. Nevertheless, it's a good, scary way to spend a little over an hour, courtesy of Columbia Studios.
