A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out, but is perceived as a threat to the survival of various industries. In this delightful comedy from Ealing Studios, Guinness is a marvel as a chemist with a sweet but persistent style. Greenwood, with his sensual voice, plays love; Parker is his harassed father. Thesiger is fun as a patriarch of the cloth industry. While telling a captivating story, the film also raises intriguing questions about science, economics and politics. It is perfectly directed by Mackendrick, who will later perform "The Ladykillers" and the sublime "Sweet Smell of Success" in the 1950s.
