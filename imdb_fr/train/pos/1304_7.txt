Okay. Yes, it was a very tight budget film with continuity errors (like unique scenes shot in the sun and then in the shadows and mixed), and although I like Nick Mancuso, he was often a bit too strong at twilight-any part, and some of the minor minor actors were really bad (more or less one actor was used for two different but remarkable roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his hair alone is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very friendly. Mancuso had excellent lines, while Nancy Allen was ironically utterly bland and uninteresting. Classic? No bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Big yes. I would have liked to be on the set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle Grieco would have. "Are you fast?" ... "You do not have that fast."
