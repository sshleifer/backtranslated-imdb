The emotional powers and characters of Dominick and Eugene are things that Hollywood no longer makes. It's one of the most emotional, sensitive and touching films I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and high school actress Jamie Lee Curtis present Oscar-winning performances! There are not enough words to express how awesome this movie is. Of course, people who are not in sentimental films may not be as interested in Dominick and Eugene as they are in the rest of the population, but for all of us this film goes straight to the heart and to the sole of compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, NEVER! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS BELOW ***** <br /> <br /> The simple but eloquent story is told with brio. Eugene is a medical trainee who faces long hours of work and a demanding workload at the hospital. His twin sibling, Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier), is a little slow and embarrassing due to brain damage caused by a victim of abuse by their father. (A heartbreaking moment when this is discovered in the film and will leave you in tears!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He must decide whether or not to finish his medical studies, which would mean accepting his residence in another city and leaving Dominick (Nick) behind, or giving up the rest of his studies to take care of him. Nicky helps pay for his brother's medical school fees by working as a garbage collector. <br /> <br /> Questions of ethics, morals and responsibilities are perfectly in this film. Just when Gino thinks that Nicky could progress on the path to independence, Dominick turns around and ends up doing things like helping a drug dealer or using a defective cord he finds in the discharge of an electrical device . <br /> <Larry, is "The Character" and Nicky's partner on his garbage path filling Dominick's credulous head with all sorts of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, which he teaches in pharmacology clinic) going to Atlantic City and losing all their money. But basically, you can see that Larry cares for him. During their tours, Nicky also befriends a little boy, whom we learn is also beaten by his father. The end result is also tragic and the pain you see on Nicky's face speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the two brothers share for each other can not be overestimated. All Nicky wants to do is to be loved and to seek acceptance in every way possible. (ie he goes to church, likes Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world. But can his brother become independent enough for Geno to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film that should have received more recognition than it deserved, but unfortunately came out about the same time as Rain Man, who was dealing with a similar problem. However, I prefer Dominick and Eugene because they have a much stronger emotional component. Be warned that this film is aimed directly at the tear ducts, so have Kleenex at your fingertips! What movie !!!!
