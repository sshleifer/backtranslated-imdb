"Kaabee" describes the difficulties of a woman before and during the Second World War, raising her children alone after her husband was imprisoned for "crime of thought". This film was directed by Yamada Youji, and as expected, the atmosphere of this film is really wonderful. Although the historical accuracy of certain scenes, including that of the beach, is suspect. <br /> <br /> The action in this film is absolutely incredible. I am confused by the way they managed to gather this star cast for a 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, perhaps the most decorated actress in Japan, will undoubtedly be the recipient of several awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was also very nice. It was Asano Tadanobu, however, who achieved the most impressive performance, perfectly illustrating the spiritual spirit of his character and the difficult situation in which he was. wonderful director and actor, I was totally absorbed by the story. In addition, it was not a far-left nonsense such as "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and examined the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that took place at that time. in Japan. Excellent movie, highly recommended to all viewers.
