I teach Japanese for a high school online and I include cultural activities so that students can get to know the country and the language. And watching "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent the film. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see that other people see the world and their lives differently than ours. Many of my students told me that they liked the movie so much that they will get a copy. It's really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I just wish I could get a cleaned TV version. I'm not really in the foul language that auto workers use all the time.
