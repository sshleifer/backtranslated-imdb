Watched this last night and was upset by the sincere intrigue, the excellent character development and the good karmic atmosphere emanating from acting and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the intrigue, it's an ordinary joe who goes to work every day and is inspired by dance classes. On the way, the protagonist and characters he meets in his quest for sweetness on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue on what dance in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it's not as easy to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the United States <br /> <br /> The film is light; you will laugh at the sight. Yet he is also worthy of a difficult way to describe. All characters in the film are taken seriously, as they are, and none of them are diminished because of their "imperfections". <br /> <br /> I thought of taking social dance classes with friends. It just happened that a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. Is it synchronous or what? I think so because now I'm really crazy to try. <br /> <br /> Look at this great family film (little kids may not have it, but teens will certainly want it) and smile at the sincere care you will see on and off. <br /> <br /> Why they would do a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery because it is perfect as is.
