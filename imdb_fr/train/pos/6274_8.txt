I went to see this movie with a group of friends one evening. I have not heard much about it. So I did not expect anything. But after seeing it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I must say that the performance of actor Giovanni Ribisi needed a little perspective. But such a small flaw, it could be canceled. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds talks about a retired car thief who has to boost 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The film is in no way predictable. So, the end should be a surprise. You think it's just another movie about fast driving? Well, you're partially right. There is more than that. Everyone should watch this movie.
