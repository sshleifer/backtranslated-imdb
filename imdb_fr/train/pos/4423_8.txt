GOJOE takes a bit of getting used to, but the end result is very satisfying. The story of a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai is worth more than a watch. There is a lot at stake here, from physical survival to spiritual salvation. The film may sound a bit similar to another early cartoon-inspired Samurai film, but it eventually dipped into a more adult / adult territory shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. GOJOE is one of the best upcoming samurai movies after Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the film and reviews of other foreign films)
