This is not the worst movie of all time, the actors are not disappointing and the scenario and the director are not completely incompetent. <br /> <br /> This is not the best movie of all time, the actors are not excellent and the screenplay and the director are not completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> It's somewhere in the middle. A fun somewhere. A nice place, well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> No need to say "do not take it seriously" or "so bad it's good" or "it was not scary". None of these comments are relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut to the atmosphere. It is this atmosphere that is truly unique and the truly original aspect of the film, which is personally what makes the film, for me.
