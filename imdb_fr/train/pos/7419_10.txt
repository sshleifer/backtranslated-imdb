Based on the insight I had seen, I went to "Shower" hoping for a sweet little comedy; What I found is a deeply touching drama of family life narrated in some of the most luxurious photographs I have had the privilege of seeing. In addition, a later reflection made me appreciate the sudden cuts in scenes from the past (in the arid countryside of northern China and the high plain of Tibet): is not that how memory works? One moment, I'm here, another I'm in a landscape of the past, just like that .... <br /> <br /> I would not only strongly recommend this film, I would put it between the two or three of best movies I've seen in my 60s. <br /> <br /> By the way, another Asian "comedy" was released in the United States under the name "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese). Just as with "Shower," the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of this movie, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (though full of fun moments). Is there a fear, on the part of the distributors, of making the films seem too "important" or "deep" to please American viewers?
