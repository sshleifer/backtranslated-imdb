Andy says, "No one gets hurt, everyone wins." Before he says it, we know the opposite is true: everyone is hurt, nobody wins. This is a new feature of American films, or maybe an old element brought back finally. Think of the "Promises of the East", "There will be blood", "No country for the elderly". These films are dark, serious, extremely well done and make fun of happy ends. I love them. "Before the devil knows you're dead" corresponds to the general description, but creates an atmosphere of its own. Kelly Masterson's first screenplay is as close as a Hollywood film will ever get to a Greek tragedy. Paying tribute to fellow experienced filmmaker Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet skillfully and soberly transforms the dark history into a tragedy of unusual characters in the old. The first shots, though an obese accountant wearing his trophy wife, looks like a Dutch master painting. In contrast, the dealer's condo is more like a chain of mondriens. Great performances all around. Only Albert Finney's character, Charles, feels a little bit agitated, his eyes wide and his mouth gaping almost all the time. But then he's in deep trouble, deeper than any of the problems that most of us know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course, you do not need me to tell you that. Why his character Gina wants to be with a guy like Andy, we are not told anything, but it's okay. Action is a character, after all. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this film a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
