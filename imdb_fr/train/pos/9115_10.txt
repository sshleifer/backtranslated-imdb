The idea is a very short movie with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and lets the viewer want more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film I have seen. I rated this film at the highest possible rating. I also recommend that this be shown to the office managers and businessmen of any institution. What emerges is that people who have ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard. This is a lesson from any office that wants to move forward. I hope the product will produce a second part to this "idea". I can not wait to see the sequence. Once again, we congratulate the Halaqah media for producing a film of excellence and quality.
