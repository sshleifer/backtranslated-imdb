I watched this episode more often than any other episode of TFTC, it's as nice as that. And it's pretty scary, but all good, fun macabre. A woman kills her second husband but comes up against a problem when a maniac dressed in tattered Santa Claus decides to visit her and her granddaughter at this very moment. Mary Traynor, who I remember from SNL or another series of comedy sketches on television, is the evil woman, and Larry Drake plays the role of the fool in Santa Claus' outfit. I had forgotten that Santa was played by Drake over the years. His Santa Claus is an unstoppable force and quite scary at times. You can probably guess how Santa finally arrives in the house. The episode is played for laughing, but it can also be quite intense sometimes.
