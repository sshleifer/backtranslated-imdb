I was able to watch this film in its entirety and have been deeply moved. I did not know if it was really a comedy or a drama - there were elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both seemed wonderful. Our image of a 60-year-old woman has certainly changed since Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only drawback of this film is that there is absolutely no mention of other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" shows of the 1970s. I would have thought that since the shooting of New York (where "Rhoda" had been installed), at least mention had been made of her sister Brenda or that Julie Kavner would have appeared, assuming of course that she was still in the Big Apple. <br /> <br /> I hope that ABC will make a series and bring back for appearances all the old shootings of these shows. By the way, what was wrong with CBS at this meeting, or a possible series? Was not it the network that broadcast the programs "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
