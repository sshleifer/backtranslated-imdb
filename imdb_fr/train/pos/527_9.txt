Not surprisingly, screenwriter / director Michael Powell considered "a matter of life and death," his haunting fantasy of Emeric Pressburger of 1946 as his favorite among all their films. Published in the aftermath of the Second World War, this colorful romantic adventure would have provided the tonic to a traumatized and recovering country that needed a good uprising. <br /> <br /> After a series of other patriotic war movies, 'The Archers have made this one their most original, their most capricious and their most patriotic. Quintessentially British for the preservation of the British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners), he is also visibly Americanized in his baroque compositions, his technical inventiveness and his beautiful multiethnic distribution. Rebels strangely in 1946 The classic "It's a wonderful life", AMOLAD opens on a great firmament, with one of those happy voices that preach on the earth and the skies and on the wonderful world in which we live. <br /> <br /> He then cuts inside a British cockpit, severely hit, in flames and with the co-pilot already dead. This seems wrong, but the relationship is quickly made clear with the events that follow. <br /> <br /> The close to five minutes of the rapid firefight between British driver Peter (David Niven) and American radio contact June (Kim Hunter) is breathtaking in his intimacy. Resigned to death, Peter nevertheless exhausts a lot of vigor, charm and glowing avowals, and his warm affiliation with June ends with a mutual exchange of "I love you". <br /> <br /> Keeping the magic of the moment, Peter, under the supervision of his leader 71, charged with transporting him to another world, escapes death and finds himself stuck on a beach. He then meets June on a bicycle and instantly associates the body with the voice. <br /> <br /> But realizing their mistake, the Supreme Court wants Peter to be dismissed and orders the French conductor (Maurice Goring) to recover it. But Peter really wants to live because of June and the mistake of the conductor and deliberately protects his corner. <br /> <br /> Peter's fate ultimately rests on the Celestial Court and the US Attorney (Raymond Massey), whose jury is composed of several dead people. war heroes and classy British delegates. The surrealist trial, which dissolves again into rich Technicolor, once the verdict is announced, may well be a dream, but the final plan at the hospital validates the predictable outcome. <br /> <br /> The abstract, the filling frame "stairway to heaven" (American title of the film) is used twice: the first time in black and white, where he raises Peter and his enigmatic French guardian to rising, crossing the giant statues of Peter's potential attorneys for the lawsuit, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second time, the dimly lit staircase serves as a frame for an emblematic image of the cinema: Peter and June, side by side, their eyes marveled fixed in the frame, their destiny sealed. <br /> <br /> The unlikely affection shared between Peter and June never turns to nothing; it is treated with nobility and the perception that the couple is already fit enough to marry and that we just have to convince people of their love so that he can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who knows how to freeze people's time and bodies, clutches their key moments together, giving Peter lectures on the story and his playful tricks, pinning the book of Peter 'Top 100 Game Tricks' and his coffee. Cup. <br /> <br /> As visually inspired as other Powell / Pressburger collaborations, it was the first time they combined color with black and white ?? the latter have a joyous quality when used for celestial scenes, and both are equally captivating. <br /> <br /> The exceptional script is more than just the design of the imaginative setting, with a dialogue that seems so immediate that it does not feel like being written or interpreted for the screen. Amusing and witty, Powell / Pressburger's writing deserves an acclaim equal to that of its strong point in color and composition. <br /> <br /> Directed in 1946, "A Matter of Life and Death" is one of those films that defy his cool and inventive age, even when CGI was changing its artificial effects, probably stripping them of their emotional wonder. <br /> <br /> Among the other delicate changes could be the need to reduce the average number of seconds of cutting and the inevitable need to shorten the dialogue in order to preserve the low attention span of most audiences . Powell weaves a spell that unconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame, giving him the freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of Peter's difficult situation.
