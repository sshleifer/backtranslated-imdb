Judy Davis shows us here why she is one of Australia's most respected and beloved actors - her portrayal of a lonely, directionless nomad is top-notch. Claudia Karvan, a teenager, also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of the most popular actors in this country in the years to come. THE LIFE OF THE UNITED STATES. (Incidentally, Karvan, a child, was a girl whose toy, Panda, had been stolen from a pharmacy in the 1983 drama, Downing with Tracey Mann.) If this movie comes to you, be sure to see it !! Note: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, POSSESSION VACANTE, LANTANA.
