A beautiful and touching film that deserves wider viewing than it is likely to get. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second generation Turkish immigrant, who is trying to break the mold. Neither at home, nor with her moderately conservative Muslim family, nor with her liberal Danish friends, does Aicha's martial arts experience become a struggle to find herself and have the strength to afford to be what she wants to be despite his family and friends. <br /> <br /> The director Natasha Arthy manages to balance the introspection and the narrative so that it has depth without becoming a heavy philosophical discourse. Relying on Xian Gao's choreography skills pays dividends in spectacular combat sequences. In the end, it is Semra Turan's impressive first performance that gives the spirit of this film. The raw charisma and skills required in martial arts are complimented by heart to make his personal drama credible. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
