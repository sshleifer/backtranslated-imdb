no, it's not supposed to be a brilliant high budget, but it's brilliant in itself. you must watch it for what it is, a low-budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist brandishing a 12-inch love rod that he prevents from beating. those who came to give this film a low criticism were probably in search of the next cult classic or hidden "jewel", as they say, and simply did not succeed. I like the way everyone points out obvious observations such as the "5 cents baby attached to a fish" hahaha, well, yes. I do not think a film with a budget like this can afford "good" actors or effects, so they work with what they have. the guts and guts were actually very convincing. the film was a little unstable, going from sequence to sequence, but overall, it's one of the best movies I've seen recently and does not follow any trend or predictability. very good to laugh.
