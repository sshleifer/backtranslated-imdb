Good story fun, fun and direct, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always love the movies in which she is). It was a good "vehicle" for a follower of comedy and drama, because there are elements of both. A romantic comedy about two crime stories, closing lines. Chaplin, very good here, was also good in another good unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth about Cats & Dogs"). Maybe they are too implausible. Ebert did not even post a review for that. The big "Screwball" comedies were obviously totally implausible ("Bringing up Baby", etc.). If you have seen an incredible comedy, have you seen them all? Or maybe people are ready from the 1930s. Weird. Birthday Girl is a movie that I have enjoyed many times. Nicole Kidman is perhaps the "killer app" for home video.
