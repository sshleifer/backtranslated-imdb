A compelling, honest, audacious and unforgettable psychological horror film that evokes the painful experiences of suffering caused by rape - "Descent" is a movie that went under the radar because of its lack of distribution because, frankly, if brutal in his representations that, if he had been released into the theater, he would perhaps have encountered a strong biased hatred. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be discovered for, not only its dark themes, but not only. for its amazing direction and authentic style - but especially for its performance. Chad Faust is absolutely amazing. It carries enough sickness and vulnerability to create one, not to understand, but to understand this fractured man with a distorted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes, but also the fragile insecurities deep inside himself . . It's such a complex, courageous and emotional support performance from Faust. And hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, Rosario Dawson stands out for his performance and his absolute revelation. A tour de force of realistic dramatic tics, and one of the most subtle shows, but as strong as possible, for quite some time. While Dawson is seen in good supporting films, some prove that she has all it takes to deliver moving and moving shows in a credible and thematic way. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies of his year (and 2007 was strong) - if this clever and underrated film was out at the movies, I would congratulate him, as well as Dawson and Faust. Too bad it's way too direct for a generalized call. Movies like this one deserve better!
