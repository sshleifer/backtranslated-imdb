This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at his best. He avoids the sweet melancholy of "All Heaven Permits" and the crying sentimentalism of "Imitation of Life" and opts instead for feverish anxiety and overheated tension. And of course, everything is captured in the vibrant Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Cornball's story has something to do with a friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack that becomes a rivalry when Hudson catches Lauren Bacall's affections, but who really pays attention to the story? Dorothy Malone has won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Female Role for her stunningly extravagant performance as Stack's sister, who takes the family business in her hands when nobody wants it. A highlight of the film comes when this ferocious and wild child makes a frantic dance in her room, unable to withstand the constraints imposed by the middle class. As often happens in Sirk films, the scene is both hilarious with its absurdity and strangely moving effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Sirk has come closer than anyone else to turn the pure camp into great art and satisfy the Philistines and the raised eyebrows at the same time within the same movies. It was a unique talent and I do not think there has ever been another filmmaker like him since. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
