I read somewhere (in a fairly panoramic review) that it was a sort of real action mecha, and I think they are on the right track. I watched this film for the first time when I was very young and I'm dying to see it again, and when I finally did it recently, all the memories came back. I do not think it should be taken too seriously - it's just a good, old-fashioned 1980s movie, almost a TV movie (it's set in the context of a rather dark future, although it's not too much emphasis). What I admired most in this film is that the dialogue did not seem generic - no clich√©s, no predictable sentences - just fun! Maybe the weather has not been sweet with this little movie, but I can still appreciate it in me. This is by no means perfect, but it's fun and does not try to be anything other than that. Let nerds and comic bookgoers worry about technical details - who cares? See for yourself and make your own decision. No one else's opinion matters.
