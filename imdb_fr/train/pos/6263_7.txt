The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe in Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to graze. You will feel like a poor pampered person after seeing these people gather their animals in icy water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to force them to walk along steep and narrow paths.
