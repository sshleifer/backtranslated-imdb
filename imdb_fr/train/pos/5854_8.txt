This game is fun and contains a plot that you can expect to see in the comics. Spider-man was framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is invaded by a strange gas and symbols like Venom and Carnage appear everywhere in the city. Who is behind these crimes? Would it be Doc Ock? Well, he seems to have turned a new page. Venom does not seem to be involved either, because he is annoyed that Spider-man has apparently cost him a good enough opportunity to take pictures. Cameos from other heroes and a lot of bad guys later, Spidey will reveal the mystery. The fights are basic, not difficult to recover, fighting with the bosses are rather fun. You have the ability to collect comics, you no longer have access to the Web and it's a bit fun to cross the city. However, it is also a weak point. The swing is not so great that all you do is fly over the city while Spider-man seems to tie his canvases to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability on the web, especially compared to a Spider-man 2 movie video game. Yet, that makes up for the rather difficult swing with the other elements, especially the story. So get ready to see Scorpio, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Dr. Octopus and Carnage for a crazy ride.
