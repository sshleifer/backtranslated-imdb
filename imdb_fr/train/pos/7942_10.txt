Lovers of Giallo, look for this rare film. It is well written and full of all the usual low lives that populate these films. I do not want to reveal anything, so I will not even talk about the plot. The whole movie creates a very weird atmosphere and you do not know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I saw this movie in English is from European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
