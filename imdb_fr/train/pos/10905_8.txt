In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. He was suffering from a terrible genetic condition called epidermolysis bullosa dystrophic (EB), which meant that his skin had literally fallen on the slightest touch, leaving his body covered with horrible wounds and leading to a last fight against skin cancer. In his last few months, Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death. The result was a film, aired for the first time in March, which was an edifying, confusing and provocative story with a singular sense of humor. Not afraid of the sad reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life fully lived. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and premiered in March 2004, The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become this year's most talked about documentary. It attracted nearly five million viewers and, after the screening, the audience donated more than half a million books to Jonny's DEBRA charity. A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund was created to raise an additional half a million dollars, with the aim of having Jonny Kennedy leave a Â£ 1 million legacy.
