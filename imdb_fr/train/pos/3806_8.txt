This film took my breath away at times, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the dialogues and the scenario of the character could have been done a little better, but hey, it's just a simple (short) story about a couple of guys trying to kill a dragon, there is nothing more! <br /> <br /> The general design, the atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes ... it's just magic! <br /> <br /> They put a lot of love in this movie. The character designs were great and fun. A little Tim Burton-ish if you want. I can recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in great design, presented in a simple but beautiful story.
