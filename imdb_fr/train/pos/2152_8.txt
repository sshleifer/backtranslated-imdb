There were great moments of reality describing modern life (not just in Japan, but everywhere). This shows how stuffy your culture can be and you want to come out of the mold, it was created for you. <br /> <br /> Dance was simply a way of saying "do what you love even if it's against the norm". Billy Elliot rather, as I would say. I also enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was well programmed and the touching moments were so real that one could feel the discomfort between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - him and that wig and his excess on the dance floor made me scream! <br /> <br /> The actors all did a great job, the story was well written. I watched it a second time and caught some small shades that I missed during the first viewing. Good entertainment!
