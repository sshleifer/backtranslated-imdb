It was a little gem. Incredible actor of lead actors Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all supporting actors. The film addresses a topic relevant not only to Ireland and the history of Ireland, but also to many communities around the world and many matrimonial units within these communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions have hurt a loving and passionate family. The title "Love divided" could not capture him better. Even if it was a true story and it was happening in Ireland in the fiftieth year, seeing how the life of the whole village is eroding and that "pogroms" are beginning to remind me history of Russia. Intolerance and prejudices are still too powerful in the world and, unfortunately, they are deeply hidden in human nature. As in the film, Liam Cunningham's character says that "hatred has always existed under the surface". It was interesting to see the moral choices people made in this story. The character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story also made sense. However, history gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and that love makes us better and stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham goes through the entire transformation in the course of history to become a man he has always wanted to be. Once again, acting is a top. The story is fast. The Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
