I had heard about TEARS OF KALI some time ago and it looked like something I would do, but with all the movies I show regularly, it almost escaped me. As I was browsing the local WonderBook ... I spotted the box for it and grabbed it. I must say that I am quite happy to have done it. TEARS OF KALI is a strange, bloody, sometimes downright terrifying film that is somewhat constrained by its obviously reduced budget - but still an entertaining and useful watch. <br /> <br /> TEARS OF KALI focuses on the fictional film based on India The cult group Taylor-Erikkson, who practices meditation and other rituals in order to confront and ban "demons" interiors of the individual - but apparently these techniques work too well or not enough (depending on your point of view ...) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed on unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The film is told "in the style of an anthology", with a short but memorable and revealing introduction sequence, before moving on to the three stories that make up the film's core. <br /> <br /> The first one (SHAKTI) talks about a journalist who visits one of the members of the sect held in a psychiatric hospital. The journalist takes cover for wanting to investigate the cult of Taylor-Erikkson, but we find that his real motives may hit a little closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that it may have fallen on the head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) concerns a young violent man sentenced to a cure of Detoxification of a prison sentence for beating a young man in a coma. We find that the treating physician in question is actually an "elder" of Taylor-Erikkson and that his methods of reeducation are far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The last story (KALI) turns around a faith "charlatan" -healer "and his assistant who perform" miracles "for a fee.When the healer unintentionally helps one of his clients and actually expels a force that had possessed him, the demon is now free to move around and look for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I really enjoyed KALI'S TEARS.The movie has flaws that keep it from being really great - but is an original and ambitious film for what it is My biggest reproach to the production is the poor and uninspired dialogue over-dubbed.The copy is below normal and I would have much preferred a suboption titled with the original language track.Some critics have says that the acting is mediocre, with which I do not necessarily agree. I think the dubbing is so shiny that performance seems to be stopped, which is not really the case. In fact, some of the performances are rather disconcerting (the "doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third easily come to mind ...) and remarkable. The gore FX are very well made for a low budget movie, with some graphic scenes of scissors to clear the eyelids, via a cuticle, a pencil suicide in the throat, some decent (but irritating) - skin and some other treats for good measure. Not as brutal as some of the most "extreme" gore movies, but certainly stronger than your average horror rate. I also found the story about the cult group to be intriguing and a welcome change in the typical nonsense of a horror story. There are many scenes of authentic atmosphere and tension, scenes that I have not seen in a while. Although fundamentally flawed, I still think that TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most "illegal" horror viewers - some scenes may be too difficult for the mainstream viewer. Highly recommended - 8.5 / 10
