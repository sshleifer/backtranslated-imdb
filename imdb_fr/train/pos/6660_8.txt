"Gandhi as husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in India. "Gandhi ... my father" is a story that few people would have known with such details. Surely a glimpse of Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the film for history and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah all did a good job. Most scenes of the film would be beautiful wallpapers ... a commendable work. Traditional Indian folk music as a background score during some parts of the film gives a good idea of ​​what is going on. <br /> <br /> However, what I did not like is the style of narration. On several occasions, I found the tone over-dramatized. <br /> <br /> All in all, good job from Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as "to watch once". 8/10
