That's one of my favorites, Mr. Motos, and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is a charming man as a defender, Mr. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a delightfully zealous museum curator, the usual comic relief is very entertaining here, and there are many suspects on which to take a look. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist does not quite have the same talent as Thomas Beck, the second usual role of these programmers, but it is enough. Stepin Fetchit is on board and, even if he speaks in a stereotypical way, his lines are funny, without his intelligence being humiliated, and he actually saves the day on the screen.
