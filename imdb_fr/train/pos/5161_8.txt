Kirk and his team land on an isolated planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted, with the exception of Mr Atoz, who runs a kind of high-tech library. Despite his efforts to get a direct response from him about the whereabouts of everyone, Atoz remains indifferent to their questions and insists that it should quickly "make his choice while there is still time". They have no idea what he's talking about, but wander looking at the mirror-like discs in the spectators' hands and see images of the planet's past. Then, while a disc is in the spectator, Kirk crosses the door and is magically transported in time until on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, another disc is in the drive and they are sent to an icy hell. Too late, they realize that the library is a time machine and a place of storage. <br /> <br /> Kirk's visit is rather short and not so exciting, but Spock and McCoy's is a lot more hectic. Spock falls head over heels for Mariette Hartley - who has been sent to this horrible place as a punishment. The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical compared to the normally logical guy. <br /> <br /> Spock's deviation from the norm, his very inventive scenario and his very diverse places make it an exceptional episode that deserves a visit. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the excellent character actor, played Mr. Atoz. I'm a big fan of old movies and I've seen him as a support player in many movies from the '30s and' 40s. He looked almost exactly like he was in this episode of 1969. Interestingly, despite his old appearance, he lived another 23 years - dying at more than 95 years !!
