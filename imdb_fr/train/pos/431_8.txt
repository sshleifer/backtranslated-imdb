It begins slowly, showing the sad life of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but do not give up. There is not much going on, but the time is passing deliciously, and there are many sneaky jokes (my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm, which I find hilarious). The film is wonderfully romantic in many ways, the scenery is beautiful (just like Polly Walker) and the film's resolutions are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes a few liberties with the book, the most important being in the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester affair, but I preferred the movie version (it may be more sentimental, but I had the impression that it corresponded better to the tone of the story, and anyway I like the feelings when it is done well). <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, especially as an appointment film in bad weather.
