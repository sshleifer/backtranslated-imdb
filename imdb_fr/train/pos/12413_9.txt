The story of a poorly executed prisoner who haunts the prison in which he was electrocuted and kills prisoners at random while waiting for revenge on the man who has charged him. <br /> <br /> Viggo Mortensen is awesome and the acting is pretty good. . Lane Smith is deliciously naughty as a guilty guardian. Also, this movie has a lot of gore, including death by mummification barbed wire.
