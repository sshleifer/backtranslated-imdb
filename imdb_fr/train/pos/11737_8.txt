OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way though. It was purposely stupid and was one of the best "stupid" movies I've seen. Jokes and gags are deliberately bad, but delivered in such a way that it gives me all the good marks. The secondary characters were rather superficial and mediocre. The plot is pretty weak, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> The character of Elvira is at the center of his concerns. In addition to her talent as an actress, she had frankly amazing physical attributes. Few men could disagree with this. The parts that show his silhouette are also part of the most amusing scenes of the film. <br /> <br /> I had a smile on my face, from the first to the last scene. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for comedy fans and fans of beautiful women. I wish they made a dozen more Elvia movies.
