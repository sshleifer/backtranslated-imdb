What another criticism has called the lack of character development, I call underestimation. The film has not been subject to over-exploration or unnecessary backstory. Yes, there were many unknown stories that we only had a glimpse of, but it was mostly a one-day snapshot of an event that catalyzed change in the lives of all the characters. Henry Thomas' performance was a very good study of the power of action that focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
