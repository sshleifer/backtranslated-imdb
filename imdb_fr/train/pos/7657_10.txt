It is a very sinister film, very hard, even brutal, on a death row break that goes wrong. His black and white photograph prevents him from being dated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as a crooked but strangely friendly leader. One of the first films to portray the psychological desolation of the death row. It's also poignant enough.
