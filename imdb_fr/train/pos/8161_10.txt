When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like bloody scenes like the dentist has a lot of bloody scenes. That's why it has the R18 rating. Dr. Alan Feinstone, a Beverly Hills Hills Dentist, discovers that his wife Brooke is cheating on him with the pool man. It's better to go to your dentist "before" to watch this. But if you do not already go to the dentist, it's better not to look at it, you risk losing your life. the dentist has the best bloody revenge I have ever seen. Who has ever seen a film in which a dentist (Spoiler) tears all the teeth of his unfaithful wife and cuts his tongue without anesthesia? Overall awesome movie, but not for everyone.
