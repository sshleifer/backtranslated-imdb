My roommate ordered this on the web a while ago and I finally started to watch it. It's disgusting. It's cheezy. It's pretty silly ... but it's also very fun. I mean, it's the most fun we've seen a movie like this since "City Of The Walking Dead" a long time ago. It was like being at the old Drive-In Theater! You can say that the guy who made this movie loved all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. It includes all the clich√©s and tips of these films, and it's good because it is SUPPOSED to be like that. The cheeze factor is high, the blood flows and the laughter rolls! The effects go from sloppy to good, with one where the guy is torn in two and one where a guy has a heart pounding in the chest, both excellent! The acting game goes from terrible to very good. There is not much ground, just a lot, a lot of gore. This one is inspired by Italian and Spanish zombie movies, I think, because they persist forever in raw scenes, like this movie. If you like Troma movies, class B stuff, you can not go wrong looking at this one. A nice way to lose a Friday night!
