It is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is virtually no dialogue outside the narrative; and the landscape and the music complement each other perfectly. At first, I did not connect the red hair of the girl and the fox before a friend (who also has red hair!) Did not report it to me. It's almost an old-fashioned kind of children's movie, saying kids today prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story, and so on. - but I think young people should be more familiar with the beauty and wonders of nature, which this film certainly describes. Perhaps not the best movie of this type, but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages - not just children.
