I loved this film. It was so well done! Excellent game and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider's movies. This one rocks, not as big as Sissi but remains as good! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, she commented and said French dubbing. Well, it's originally a German and non-French film. So yes. Second, there was a plot, maybe you are not familiar with the story. Oh and his mother played the role of his housekeeper, not his teacher. And the plot was actually not Cinderella, but Queen Victoria. Maybe you missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But anyway ... yes, the story of this film is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is fascinating. ! I like all the historical stuff. Like this guy who was trying to manipulate his mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband, he showed her the "new type of dance" waltzing. When the waltz was new, it was considered a little outrageous because couples dance very closely. Yes, his housekeeper was like oh my god! <br /> <br /> And also clothes, I love clothes. The styles are great, the hoop skirts are great. And of course, Romy is still very pretty.
