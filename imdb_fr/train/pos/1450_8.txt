Excellent political thriller, played much more silently and more slowly than other high-profile films of this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to override this outstanding performance? A story of friendships, father-son relationships, corruption and deception. The two actors mingle marvelously, and Aiello and Fonda's supporters are equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when newspapers are in press. Instead of focusing on a complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters that show the human side of failure as political corruption. The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and performed.
