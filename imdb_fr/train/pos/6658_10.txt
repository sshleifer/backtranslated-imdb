Mahatma has been described as a man who neglected his own son in this film. Do not get me wrong, I do not condemn the movie; it's such a wonderful film and I'm out of the movie theater with a lump in my throat. We must understand the spiritual status of Mahatma, who is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man can possibly detach himself from his loved ones. A man with such caliber leads his family and his faithful by example. According to the film, he spoke to his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilall, with so little intellect, could not understand his father. When things did not go well with Harilall, Mahatma could remain calm and accept that her son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If this had been the case for other parents, they would have compromised their values ​​to help the son get up. Mahatma did not do that, he is a true leader who sets the example.
