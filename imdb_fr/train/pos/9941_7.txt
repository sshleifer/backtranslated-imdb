You know the story - a group of brave hopeless people compete in a competition they apparently have no chance of winning - it's a story that has been made to death by Hollywood (Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the best etc). Now, Korea is trying a taekwondo team in search of glory ?? and guess what ?? the result is predictable, but ultimately satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film does not fall flat is the talent of the young cast that you really care about the characters, which makes you look to the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of your typical martial arts film are likely to be disappointed ?? Taekwondo does not deliver the usual flow of movement and acrobatics found in most Kung Fu films; the action is limited to (though impressive) kicks and occasional punches. It does not matter, because it's the interaction of the characters and their fight to do something of themselves that makes this movie a success.
