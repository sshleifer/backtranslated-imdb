this film proves that you do not need big explosions, multi-billion dollar computer images, or high paid actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is an excellent storyline and plot. Akira Kurosawa, the master of all Japanese films, succeeds brilliantly. I recommend this film to anyone who loves a period epic piece. and for those who like the previous works of Kurosawas. 10/10
