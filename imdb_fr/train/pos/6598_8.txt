I saw this movie when I was traveling in Brazil. I had a hard time really understanding Brazilian culture and society because there are so many differences between regions and classes. Seeing this film in Sao Paulo has been a revelation. This shows something of the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other side, it's sometimes a little too dramatic. And this is the only negative comment I have on this movie. It's sometimes too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for a single film. The director could film a little more subtle things, it would make the film more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite that, I liked the film and the way the story unfolds. The characters are complex and very much like those of real life. No pretty American actresses and actresses with lots of cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film realistic even when the story is not as convincing.
