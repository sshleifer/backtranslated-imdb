I am extremely difficult on the movies I see. I had heard about Moon Child completely by accident. I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for a while, and a fan of Gackt and Mizer recently. <br /> <br /> I finally discovered that the movie was being reissued. Second reflection. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am about movies, I admit, action scenes can sometimes be a little hokey ... but they are also meant to be, like suggested another user. the quintessence of calm before the storm, quoting Gary Oldman from Leon ... without going into detail, the film hit me very hard, because we realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and, as we often said, true friendship is loyalty and love marriage, it is until death separates you. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give performances that show why they are able to devote such depth to the lyrics of their songs. Their passion for music goes on the big screen. he creates an exemplary film that will penetrate the soul and arouse emotional reactions. <br /> <br /> Seeing the movie for the first time, I realized that it would probably stay in an important rotation regarding my collection. I would like to encourage anyone who reads this article to get the film if you want to get away from the current trend of Hollywood cinema ... it takes a whole new direction using classic Yakuza movie elements and how can you go wrong? with a Ryo Ishibashi cameo from Takashi Miike's celebrity "Audition" and "Suicide Club"? <br /> <br /> Man..I can not say enough about this film, but I will stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
