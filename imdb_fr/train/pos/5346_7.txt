Carol, the girl in the center of history, is transplanted to a foreign country, Spain, at the height of the Civil War conflict in the late 1930s. For this girl, everything is new, in her strangeness. The war and her father are her constant concerns, as she must immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this film by numbers. Carol's family is clearly divided. Carol's mother is married to an air force pilot belonging to the left faction. The rest of the family sympathized with Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story does not add anything to what has already been said, it's much better, but it's an easy film to watch. The beautiful landscape of northern Spain is presented. Do not expect much action, as most of what is happening revolves around Carol and the boys with whom she befriends. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence. Maria Barranco is the mother of Carol, Aurora, the one who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who befriends Carol. Carmelo Gomez plays Alfonso, the man Aurora left when she left for America. This actor, who usually has major roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do because it remains an enigma throughout the film.
