"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of comedy that makes you laugh and say "huh?" But I suggest giving it a chance. I think it is greatly neglected. Few people give this film a chance. It works. Just think of it as a little parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he is doing it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He's just going from big bosses to a beautiful woman. And of course, as in many popular movies, someone wants him dead. 90% of the jokes make you laugh. Like, I said give a chance. Take your favorite gangster movies and mix a comedy. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
