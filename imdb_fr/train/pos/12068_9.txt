If you have any appreciation of character and dialogue, and a sense of American cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film. It was probably originally a play, which is why dialogue is a heavy burden, but I can not emphasize enough that these icons, of which we understand very little, are transformed into characters really. complex and wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film is better than any college class to explain how to create a story centered on the characters. <br /> <br />
