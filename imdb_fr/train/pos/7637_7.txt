In fact, I like this movie even if I do not like James Belushi very much. In this film, you can see several big names on the rise, including Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine was already fat, of course. The plot in this film is simple; it's just like this movie sliding door. This has been said lightly, however, and I like comedy moments. It made me try to relive my own important moments live, for example, if I took this girl for a movie, not the other, etc. It tells us that the people around us could have played different roles in our lives if some of the details needed to change. It also reminds us to pay attention to what we want. Life is not always as good on the other side as we think; Maybe what we have now is the best for us, all things considered.
