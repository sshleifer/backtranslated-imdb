John Singleton's best film, before the hit movies like Shaft's Remake, is a thought-provoking film, with fantastic acting and a superb balance between the three main characters, each with identifiable issues for young people . <br /> <br /> What I most appreciate is that it also addresses the problem of perversity among Black youth, a problem generally ignored by the media and other films that mainly deal with socio-economic problems and white racism. This film shows that blacks can be just as ignorant as they are racist. <br /> <br /> The remarkable aspect of this film is that it deals with many subjects without becoming superficial. It is not just racism, but the difficulty of adopting a new world (university), rape by date, the discovery of sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each offer great performances. Secondary distribution is just as interesting: Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college fools causing small riots. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the caricature of a teacher Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Certainly, many teachers are crazy. But they are not so flat. Skinheads are also a little caricatural, but I guess they are too caricatural in real life. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is very misunderstood. If you liked American History X, you'll love this one. . <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
