A nice movie although I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth. Midway through the movie, it's mysterious to know why Elly is so reclusive. Then, when we finally get an explanation from his childhood, there are still not many details. Maybe they had flashbacks or something else? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's always a good movie that I'll watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
