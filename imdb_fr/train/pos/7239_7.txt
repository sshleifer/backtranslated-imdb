What a movie gem, so good that they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The film starts really well with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the two main characters first saw each other. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, who is a little clue, who moved to town and uses the services of a real estate agent to find him a home. <br /> <br /> Hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The film is viewable, but the actors' performances are very wooden and they seem not to want to be in this movie, but maybe it's part of the decadent atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Did not like the end, but there is a sequel, you have to find it. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes did not really fit. Later, I could not help but think of him, he exhaled somehow a strange sensuality, so he might be right for the role. as a lieutenant Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
