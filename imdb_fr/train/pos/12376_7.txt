Boasting an impressive cast of stars that almost resembles the "Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad" horror images, "The Sentinel" (1977) is nevertheless a scary film centered on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines . In it, she plays a model, Alison Parker, who settles in a brownstone Brooklyn Heights very close to the door of hell (and I do not think I give too much to this late date). And as a tenant of this building, she suffers from much worse conditions than leaking plumbing and the occasional water virus, to say the least! Indeed, the scene in which Alison meets her noisy neighbor upstairs is really terrifying and should certainly send chilled water down the peaks of most viewers. Despite complaints from many critics about Raines' actress ability, I thought she was doing very well, coping more than skilfully in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The conclusion is indeed mysterious and, even if some arguments remain unexplained, I felt more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" says, "any film with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as cannibal lesbians with naked breasts in leotards can not be so bad"! By the way, yesterday I went to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to have a look at the Sentinel House. Yes, she is still there and, although she has been stripped of her thick ivy cloak and has no blind priest on the top floor window, she looks much the same as in this picture. If this house really sits above the entrance to hell, I guess hell is ... the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers have known for a long time!
