I love this movie and have seen it many times over the years. This improves with each viewing. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is realistic and brutally realistic as life on the prairies was at that time. I found myself commenting while watching him. Someone here said that Rip Torn was a bad idea. I could not disagree any more. He is brilliant like Clyde Stewart, a miser and miser who says little and works as a slave / workaholic. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as Elinor's widow, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper / cook (with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called grandmother. The Montana meadow is also a star. It is a country at once magnificent and brutal in which to settle. Some scenes are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! He even has a perfect musical score and an excellent script. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget it. He deserves every 10, he arrives here.
