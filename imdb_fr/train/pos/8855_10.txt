Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still has some fun! A few years ago, he shot "find me guilty", proof that everyone can really act, if he had the opportunity and the good director. If he had retired after this film (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one would have blamed him. But his next film is already announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But stay with this movie here. The list of actors is incredible, their performances are first rate. The small nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and / or the situations that evolve throughout the film are simply incredible. The structure (temporal) of the film, which stays the course all the time, mixing time lines so transparent that the editing seems natural / flawless. The story is reinforced, even if, even in a "normal" time structure, it was at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is yours! : o)
