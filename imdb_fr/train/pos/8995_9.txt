I did not find anyone to watch DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of either group. Naturally, everyone has assumed that you could only enjoy this film if you like the music of The Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown's Massacre, but that is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths that a group can take, and watching the public eat and spit the Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other critics who say it would be nice to have Anton as the last word, since he is clearly described as his worst enemy and the bulwark that keeps the group from staying. <br /> <br /> Very interesting For me, respect for the Dandies towards the BJM (despite their absence or reciprocity) and towards Anton (despite his erratic behavior). The Dandy Warhols respect the art produced by the band, even if it hates everything the Dandy Warhols now represent (although it's debatable). The best answer is when Dandy's drummer says "I'll never have them again" and the guitarist lets out unconsciously "I'm still going to buy their records." For me, this shows how good music can be powerful. <br /> <br /> See this movie, even if you do not know anything about the two bands. It's more about the themes of rock music and their evolution that make this film so interesting. It is rare to follow a group so closely for as long.
