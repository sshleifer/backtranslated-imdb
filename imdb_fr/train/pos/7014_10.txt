Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just watched Seven Pounds. Nobody can make me cry like Will Smith. Man is very much in tune with the vast range of human emotions. This film was skillfully and beautifully done. Rare to find such intense humanity in Hollywood today. I would compare this to "Pay it Forward" and "Crash" until the sight of light and darkness in such a raw way. Stay with you for a long time and give you a lot of food for thought. I have a deep love and a passion for movies like this one. This is usually not the case for a "bad end" but rather a truth seeker who embraces emotion, raw life and something more than the superficiality that exists in abundance everywhere. Therefore, it does not bother me to suffer a little in the end. It is true that there are not always happy ends. Sometimes it's just not the happy ending you think you should be. Many people have lived a happy life despite the loss of love and life of one of them. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest, you will love this movie!
