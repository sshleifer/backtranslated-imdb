Why not love this movie? Every year you know that you are going to have one or two Christmas tide movies at Christmas and most of them are going to be awful. This film is really a fresh new idea that went very well. A very funny movie about a rich young man who pays a family to simulate a real Christmas. What is the point of having money like that if you can not do fun things with it? It was a win-win situation. An ordinary family has six characters and a rich man experiences Christmas as he had imagined. Only if. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to manage and it was moving to see the family reluctantly accept its absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
