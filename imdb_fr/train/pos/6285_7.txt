What's in a name? If the name is Jerry Bruckheimer, expect it to be filled with action. <br /> <br /> In the latest film by producer Bruckheimer, Gone in 60 Seconds, everything is devoted to nomenclature. With names of characters like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and idealized cars with names such as Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's only the non-stop action that prevents you from playing the game of the name. . <br /> <br /> It's certainly a profound scenario, but it's a great vector of action since Nicolas Cage, while Memphis Raines, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, is coming out of the retirement of a flying car to save his brother's life by stealing a list of 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of the cult hit of 1974, this film may not be for the same cult status, but it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the action that lets you watch, not play. Although loaded with stars, none of them has outstanding performance, including a very low performance of one of my favorites and enthusiasts, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, who has just won her recent Oscar, is only a symbolic interest with barely time to go on screen. <br /> <br /> Are a series of great cars and pursuits for which they embark are able to make a good movie? I think so. The film is a pleasure to watch and although a scene in particular plunges you into the realm of incredibleness, the action does not stop and the suspense is irresistible. Beware of other drivers competing for pole position when leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
