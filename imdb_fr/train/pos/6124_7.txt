This movie is crazy like hell! I think it was a serious movie, but when it came time to film, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's add humor and spice it up!" The characters are also slightly developed. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate, though, was the weapons for hair dryer. What was all this?
