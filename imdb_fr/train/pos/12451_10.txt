Although I bought the DVD when it was released for the first time and I watched it many times, I never wrote a review. <br /> <br /> I loved it when I saw it for the first time and I still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems he has never made enough money to motivate anyone to follow up. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, if he makes a film as faithful to the comics and books as My Name is Modesty, with another major female role, anyone who is not familiar with the character will see it as a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense than action thrillers. <br /> <br /> The real battle between Modesty and Miklos is real, a source of tension, suspense and fascination for all those who do not need blood and explosions. Alexandra did a great job playing how O'Donnell's character would have taken control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find this particularly ahead of the curve after the much needed reboots of Batman and James Bond. After two sad previous attempts, although less known to the public, it is actually a reboot of the character of Modesty, and it is really sad that no film about him will probably be shot.
