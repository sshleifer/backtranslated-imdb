Wonderfully set up..I would like this documentary to follow the lives of some and celebrates those of those who have been lost ... there should be a second part ... a real one. It was great ... the movie was not long enough ... I would like to know why the creator of the movie did not follow !! it's so important for the community period..well if you're reading this, please, consider doing another documentary like this ... I'm really tired of hearing naive writers how AIDS and men go together when they do not do it; in fact, it is the straight question that we must examine. This movie did not even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so happy about it .. I really enjoyed the details and the definitions. Thank you very much for allowing this film to exist.
