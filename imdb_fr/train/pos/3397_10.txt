Soylent Green EST ... a very good movie, actually. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought of it. I do not really like Heston in his science fiction endeavors. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, manage most of the time to be ridiculous and invincible. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, he's making his way through much of Soylent Green as well, but since he's supposed to play a confident tormentor, it does not really bother me. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people make fun of us. to this film. Soylent Green makes no effort to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - this looks like 1973), and that lacks action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was so glad to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving and entertaining final role. The good little moments of character - like when he shares precious food with Heston - really make the film. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is rather relevant nowadays, when no one seems to know what the government or the devil can do. companies are up to it. It's funny, is not it, to see Heston in a Michael Moore movie prototype ...
