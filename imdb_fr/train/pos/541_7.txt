As a result, it's not a bad movie. I actually liked it better than the first one. I found it more entertaining. It seemed like it had been shot in a documentary style. bothered me, because I thought it was too low budget.but it increased on me, and it gave the impression that the movie was more authentic.This movie has more dry liners than the original, this which is a good thing, in my opinion.I sometimes think they went a little too high with some of the scenes and characters.it becomes almost a parody of itself, which may be the point. this film has at least some suspense, which the first did not, in my opinion.it has some of the same great music of the original, which is excellent.The acting was still quite correct in the together, although, as I said, some seemed exaggerated. I also felt that the film lost a lot of momentum towards the end and a few minutes ago that seem very slow and do not seem to flow like in the rest of the film. However, I thought it was a nice sequel. Note y for "Back to Cabin by the lake" is 7/10 *
