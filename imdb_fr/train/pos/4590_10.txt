The movie itself may not be one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone will agree with me that the fight at the mall was one of the best fight scenes ever . There were also some memorable stunts, so impressive that they made this movie a classic of action. This film has influenced many other action films and I think today the directors of action films should learn from this film (as they could remake this hunting scene, I think with the modern technologies, they could make it even better). Some fun scenes also made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie was not fighting. Although I think they could put more fight scenes in this movie.
