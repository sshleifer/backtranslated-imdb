I saw this film being a Jane Austen addict and still having doubts about the cinematic rendering of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply precise, intelligent, delicate, cautious, delicate, respectful, intense, a word, perfect! <"Emma" is one of the most charming and amusing novels of Austen, thanks to the general irony that prevails in the situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony, without neglecting the comic element (Miss Bates above all). What the film clearly explains is the deep knowledge of human life demonstrated by the English novelist and the modern look with which women, men and their relationships are treated, and it's stunning how a novelist of the 18th century century, who lived almost isolated, was able to grasp the depth and truth about life as she did: it fascinates me a lot and always. We feel this modernity throughout the film: it is enough to replace the costumes and use a more common language, but situations, feelings, ideas are extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in the lives of others, or the insinuation of the envy that always reigns in women's relationships, and which remains a difficulty in revealing and expressing one's feelings, especially one's love: each situation is universal and out of the ordinary. time value. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (she would probably be too mature to do it nowadays), Toni Colette is just great. And as I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation takes on a magical and dreamlike dimension ... a truly enjoyable and deserving film.
