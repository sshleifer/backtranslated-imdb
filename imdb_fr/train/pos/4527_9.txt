One of the ten best comedies to date <br /> <br /> It's such a joyful and light comedy that sings. Keaton's comedies are _dernement, harmoniously, intelligently ordered, thought. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully fun, deliberately charming and inventive, THREE AGES should be part of a comedy project among the top ten if I had to sketch one. A triple love story will enchant the audience. I want to bring this approach here - Keaton's comedy looks like DESTINY upside down or Lang Reverse. Once again, a couple crosses the waters of time and times from the Stone Age, from Rome and Keaton times, to a Muslim country, to Italy to the Renaissance and to China. The same camera works in both movies - a sinister and disturbing melodrama; - the other, a light comedy, virtuous rhythm. At Keaton, it's essentially the same couple. and maybe the same thing is with Lang. The desired baby by Buster and Beery is nice. I found THREE AGEs well written and clever, without being sophisticated with ostentation; the plot is basically very POPEYE ?? as the girl is a piece of furniture, the only protagonists are the two male rivals ?? Keaton and Beery. <br /> <br /> Keaton's movie is just very nice, and maybe we would be tempted to say it sounds like an ambitious pleasure, but it's not, but it's a great pleasure, a great pleasure, a lot of pleasure. And Wallace Beery makes a beautiful nemesis.
