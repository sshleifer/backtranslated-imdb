Excellent film, a realistic image of contemporary Finland, touching and profound. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Capture perfectly the daily life of a small town in central Finland, the desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows of the population. The radiant sun of early autumn creates a fresh atmosphere for this lucid examination of people in a society of well-being. Lampela is one of Finland's most promising filmmakers. It shows that it is possible to make captivating films without machine guns and without bloodshed. His next film, Eila, is also worth the detour, although the story of housekeepers struggling for their jobs is not as universal as Joki's fates.
