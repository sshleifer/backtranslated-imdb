I thought it was a very good movie and it should have been released first. It would not have been a big blockbuster but it would have brought in a lot of money. The film is suspenseful and makes you wonder how it is in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do such a good job. Considering this is his first film, he did a good job. It's a good movie to watch and watch when you do not know what you want to rent that night. It should be pretty good. The cast was great. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie!
