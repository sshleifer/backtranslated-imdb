Ida Lupino was one of the few women to have crossed the Hollywood director's glass ceiling under the studio system. Not surprisingly, she also touched on proto-feminist themes that, when touched, were approached with such delicacy that it was rarely very clear what one was talking about. In Outrage, she deals with rape and its aftermath. Although, throughout the short film, we speak of "violent aggression", it leaves, for once, no doubt about what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in his official debut) plays a secretary-accountant in a large industrial plant; she lives with her parents but is engaged to a very influential guy (Robert Clarke), who has just received a pay raise and now earns $ 90 a week. Leaving the factory after working late into the night, she finds herself hunted down. In the scene that follows ?? the best in the movie ?? she tries to escape her pursuer in a maze of buildings and alleys but fails. <br /> <br /> When she comes home, sick and shocked, the police can not get much out of it; she claims to have never seen her attacker (who was in a snack truck in front of the factory) trying to pretend that nothing happened, she goes back to work but falls apart, thinking that everyone is looking at her, the judge. She enters a state of fugue, fled to Los Angeles in a bus but accidentally departs at a rest stop. <br /> <br /> Upon awakening, she discovers she was rescued by Tod Andrews, a young minister from a farming town in California. She lies about her identity and takes the job of packing oranges. The two fall in love, but Andrews clearly knows that Powers keeps some terrible secrets. When, during a company picnic, she grabbed a key and tore Jerry Paris' skull, who was trying to steal a kiss from her, the truth about her past is revealed .... <br /> <br /> It was brave film to be released in 1950, and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings. Lupino never finds the verve of the first scene of assault, and the film gets lost in the bucolic and sentimental to finish talkative and didactic. Yes, Lupino had important information to communicate, but she did not trust the story to speak for herself. His casting, pleasant but bland and generic, was not help either, returning to melodramatic postures or insurance. But Outrage was a breakthrough, paving the way for a later speech about what rape really is and what it really means for its victims.
