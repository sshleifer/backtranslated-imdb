Yes, the poster is a pretty horrible job. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was OK ... nothing really exceptional ... I was just hoping it would be a hardcore drug addict and put it completely in the trash life. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but that can not happen to rich kids now, is it? Not the son of a wealthy businessman who organizes big parties in the ballroom and has a beautiful, well-kept lawn at the front of the mini-mansion. <br /> <br /> No ... the kid is too good to have a life completely upset. After all, who will drive the all-new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the poor little rich kids ... in their pretty, picturesque house, with their ivy league schools, their very own houses and their mundane feasts ... what would the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope they all become addicted to drugs, die of their lives and end up in jail ... so maybe we can see movies that do not all revolve around poor little boys and rich girls from the surreal world.
