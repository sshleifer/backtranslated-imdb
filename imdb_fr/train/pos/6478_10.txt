Even if we are told from a British point of view, this is the best documentary on the Second World War ever produced. Presented in digestible episodes (as digestible as the war may be) as Laurence Olivier's deep voice connects the multitude of eyewitnesses who have been forced to live the events of this horrible epoch. Looking forward to his appearance on DVD in the United States. Europeans had their chance with a DVD release earlier this year.
