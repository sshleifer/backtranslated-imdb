When I sat down to watch Largo Winch, I was expecting nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both; and more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie, to begin with. Kristin Scott Thomas did a good job, but in my opinion, the two real stars were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both of whom acted remarkably. In Radivoje, Bukvic has well described Goran. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics gave the film a beautiful color, but I understand why people get bored with this movie. <br /> <br /> The landscape of Hong Kong and especially the beautiful Croatian seaside amazed me and I really wanted to leave the screen when Largo entered this island of a incredible beauty. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone likes expensive limousine cars; it's their film. It's also a movie for those who love action sequences, actor scenes, landscapes of extreme beauty and, most importantly, a fast-paced and well-written action movie with dazzling fights and drama. deeply bound interior. <br /> <br /> My vote, because it lit up a gloomy day is: 10/10
