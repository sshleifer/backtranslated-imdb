One critic notes that no matter what Welles says or actually does, it moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the film. More than a triple threat capable of acting, writing and realizing, he possessed a genius particularly apt at filming. One wonders if he would have been a painter earlier. This film certainly reinforces this impression. A musician, a theater actor, an heir to Shakespeare? Hard to say, but I am very grateful that his time is with the film and that it is captured. I like the accent I like the face, the size, the style, the spirit and the games. I like all his films and I hope there are more. I particularly like the way the other actors interacted with him in the film. Many were never better or at least somewhat different with him because he was firmly there. Even towards the end when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intention, it was impossible to ignore him and he did all the scenes in which he was. Rita was a gorgeous blonde - a Lana Turner alike but maybe even more beautiful and even The eyes go to Welles and we wish a minute more, another film, an hour more in his company. That's why we all want to be able to find the lost remains of his films because we know, we all know, that there is no part of him that is not worthy of our time. Look at it and be grateful for the luck.
