"Pecker" proves that Waters does not intend to change his habits in his old age. A lot has changed since Waters started making movies in the 1960s, but 40 years later, he's still doing what he wants. Over the years, Waters' film budget has increased dramatically. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that "trailer park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child obsessed with photography. He lives a quiet life in Baltimore, Maryland, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the ever-observable Lili Taylor) and his life changes for the worse. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. This is not one of his best films, but there is a big belly laugh here ("Memama" has the best lines of the movie!). He's always smart and funny, and has that "queer" sensibility that I've become in love with in Warters movies.
