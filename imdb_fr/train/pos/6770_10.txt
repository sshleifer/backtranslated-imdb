Airwolf The Movie, a variation of the original 2-part driver, but the movie, although shorter, contains additional images Invisible in the 2-hour driver The pilot is much more a pilot than the movie Where as a pilot, the film is normally the same (2 parts combined) But the film is actually a different montage with extras here and cuts here. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look, even if you have the DVD of season 1 in stock, I still would like to take a copy of the "film" It is still present in some stores as Virgin , Woolworths and mixed media stores, although it is usually necessary to order, <br /> <br /> Airwolf was really one of the worst-selling salons of the 80s. <br /> </ br> > A full size Airwolf is being rebuilt for a helicopter museum:) Photos of information and work in progress are completed on http://Airwolf.org. Also with Airwolf mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games. stay :)
