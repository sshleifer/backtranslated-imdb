This show is great! I've been a fan since its inception, and it just looks at me ... I've seen terrible things here that I wish I did not have, BUT, it really shows how addiction affects everyone involved, not only the addict. You can see all kinds of addictions, from drugs to alcohol to the addicted to shopping or the addiction disorder. And in fact, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have also gone through. We have seen accomplished musicians, an NBA player and even young people who really need help. And since they started showing some follow ups, it's great too. Now you can see how much time they spent after the broadcast of their ep. If you have not checked this one, please do it. It's on A & E, and it's great! The new eps are on Sunday nights at 10 pm, if I remember correctly ... then set your TiVo!
