This film is terribly underestimated on IMDb. Like so many movies, it's not Shawshank. But it's a reasonably good, though predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a kind of 8 Mile for a dancer, then I think you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Judging by the IMDb ratings, I imagine that c The film was approaching the top 250 and was "bombed" with a lot of 1, as happens to so many movies that do not are not crowd, have no special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters. It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. Especially in Toronto, the clues are subtle, and some audiences may think that everything is happening in the United States, simply because the final competition is taking place in the border town of Detroit. <br /> <br /> I liked the music. I liked the dance (but I'm not convinced that it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy to watch. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title is nil. I do not remember anyone in the movie who said those words, and he should have an "s". (No, it's not a foreign language) <br /> <br /> There is not much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, a 1 vote means you hate it), so I can only assume it's an expression hatred for the kind of people who are there, and it's sad.
