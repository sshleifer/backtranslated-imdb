This film is horrible - in a genre "so bad it's good". <br /> <br /> The story is summed up by so many other films of this kind, that I will not even describe it. It's a sword / sorcery picture, a child hopes to realize how important it is in this world, a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil wizard / sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature ... you understand. br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film was during a very harsh winter. I do not know why I decided to keep watching it for another five minutes before turning the channel, but when I caught the Gulfax site, I decided to stay and watch it until the end . <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white and hairy creature resembling Chewbacca, but not as useful or fun to watch. It looks like someone stuck a pile of white carpets and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes where it seems that the actor can not move inside, or that he almost falls. Although there is not much in the film, the few scenes are worth it! Watch how he tries to talk to Bo Svenson, pushing the Solo-Chewbacca comparison to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this movie just because of this character and I always have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I have never seen the sequel, or even sought, is because of his absence! Maybe if there was one last movie to complete the trilogy, Gulfax will make a long awaited comeback!
