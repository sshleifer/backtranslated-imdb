Hitler's visit to Rome is the backdrop to this tender love story of friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six who stays at home while her entire family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay home because the family can not afford a maid. She would have loved to go because she is a fervent admirer of Il Duce and she has the whole complex of housing where she lives. <br /> <br /> There is one exception, however. On the other side of the yard, Marcello Mastroianni is sitting in his chair and considering suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and recently lost his presenter position on the radio because of this. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is desperate and badly in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own deceitful husband, misunderstands Mastroianni and, in a masterfully shot scene, directed and played on the roof of the real estate complex, her body is only offered to her to be rejected. His initial appetite is soon replaced by the thirst of this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, this other world that is so willing to give it all it wants. <br /> <br /> C movie with two of the most talented actors of all time. Loren proves here that she is a well-directed actress. It is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and, more importantly, the human condition. Despite his sad end, the denouement suggests hope, things will change, someone understood.
