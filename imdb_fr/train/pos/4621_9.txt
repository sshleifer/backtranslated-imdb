Considering all teen movies like "The Breakfast Club" and "Pretty In Pink" which are lionized. It is surprising that this one is so ignored. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, but you think about it, including the idea that what others think may be important. Children do not always get along with their parents, but neither parents nor children are considered to be always right or wrong, and parents are not perceived as monsters. <br /> <br /> This is the cult of heroes. How a girl does something dangerous, which could have created more dust, before she realized she was wrong. <br /> <br /> The film is a little ahead of its time. A child asks another child which contraceptive he uses. She says she does not do anything to need birth control. She answers (wrongly) "oral sex".
