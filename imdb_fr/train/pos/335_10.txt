I have been trying to discover this series for ages! Thank you, IMDb! I saw him as a child and I never really managed to get him out of my mind. At 6, of course, I was particularly struck by the Cyclops episode, which was absolutely scary (I talked about it so much that my older brother made me to make a cyclops figure of a man of cave in What I also remember is the unusual atmosphere from the beginning - mysterious, austere and extremely authentic When I read the original several years later, I felt the same sensation. It's a very difficult thing to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood - every "Odyssey" I've seen since has been a huge disappointment - the characters in this series seemed authentic, real characters - ancient Greeks - and not Hollywood stars in costumes, it's a true masterpiece, but why is it not better known and why is it not available on VHS or DVD? to see that again!
