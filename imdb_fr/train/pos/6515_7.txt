I almost did not praise this because of all the bad comments, but I did it anyway. I thought it looked like darkness, which I liked as well. The only thing I hated about this tooth box was the two red-necked brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh but it was not a comedy. It ruined the film for me because it was useless. The rest of the movie was like a horror or suspense movie. The makeup was good and I saw movies far worse than this one. It was a simple story with a credible acting game. It's not the scariest or the most goretic film, but I did not want to be reimbursed and not want to be reimbursed after watching it. On the DVD, there were glimpses of other films that all look good and I'm going to check them out.
