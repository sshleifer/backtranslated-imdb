Surprised by "Braveheart", released the same year, the two costumed dramas require a comparison. I admit my bias against Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference for "Rob Roy". "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" convincingly describe Scottish history in a bloody and romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic paean with individual honor and courage and a beautiful fantasy of revenge. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note its use of the filming lens in slow motion. His violence is both ugly and glorious. It is this latter quality that makes it more attractive to the teenage mentality. Although "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy" in terms of levels of carnage (not to mention his indulgent time), this latest film is finally more mature and more satisfying. Its action is more discreet, but more surprising and intelligent. His sex is less conspicuous, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better realized romantic interest. His dialogue tries to get closer to the poetry of the time. His rotten teeth in the mouth of the actors try to get closer to the dentistry of the time. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended: "The last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot". You may find that the latter is more like "Braveheart" with a focus on bloodlust, while the former is more like "Rob Roy". All the above-mentioned films deserve their R rating for violence.
