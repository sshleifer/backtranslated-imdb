Absolutely hilarious. John Waters tribute to the people he loves most (the Baltimoreans) is a twisted little song with a lot to watch and laugh about. It's like being in a kitsch museum! I have not laughed so much at the theater since Serial Mom. I loved seeing Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, two old friends from Dreamland, in front of Waters' camera. The cast is just beautiful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Uses the best elements of past atrocities (especially the underestimated polyester) and lots of new surprises. Made me sick, in a wonderful way. Thank you John!
