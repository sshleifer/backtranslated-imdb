I liked the dark black of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The bad mood of the decor and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth were felt. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the film; she was a serious and attractive character. The film slipped for me when the deputy mayor began to search the Mafia to get to the bottom of things that his boss obviously did not want to interfere with. Nobody, in their minds, would meet a mafia on an abandoned dock in a Junkyard. Here the story has become improbable. Something I do not understand: why did the policeman and Vito have a shootout if he was delivering information that would bring down the corrupt judge?
