The film is really poignant, unique and edifying. History is universal to the extent that it is a battle between good, evil and the world between the two. The most important thing is that his rating is wrong, misleading and paradoxical. Blockbuster noted it as if it was an X rated movie. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple subtitles .
