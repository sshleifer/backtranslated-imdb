1.) This movie was amazing! I watched it while I was in the city next to the one where he grew up! I went to see the buildings in which the story unfolded. Overall, I loved this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best !! In addition, my favorite parts were the science fair and all times with his father. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not seem to care in any way. This slogan is true. "Sometimes, One Dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2.) The way this film was shot was flawless, everything was so credible that it could have been recorded during the 1950s. The attire was accurate and they also had slang. I really recommend this movie!
