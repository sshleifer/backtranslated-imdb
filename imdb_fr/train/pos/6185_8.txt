I just watched MURDER AND THE VANITIES in the newly released Universal Pre-Code game and was amazed at how much I enjoyed the vehicle from start to finish. Most of the other commentators covered the story, a murder mystery in a musical, but I wanted to add some extra notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively bland, even compared to most underage players, and neither of them really seems to have the right voice for what he sings (Carlisle being a lyrical singer, Brisson a little low notes). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well, with excellent timing that keeps the ball rolling between the musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are girls from Vanities, but let's not forget the beautiful jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of his first appearances, a little like Eve Arden; Patrick will become the executive producer of the television series Perry Mason. Then there's Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe mistress - you'll also notice her in David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson introduced the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marihuana" with peyot girls dressed in the background (blood flowing over the white skin of a choir was wonderfully chilling); the "Ebony Rhapsody", with Duke Ellington's orchestra and a plethora of beautiful, black and white dancers, mixing it. And I think it's one of the only older musicals to offer such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
