As a person who has been living with brain pain for over forty years, I find this film very inspiring. If someone with such a serious case of PC Christie Brown can do the same, there is no reason why I can not realize my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker give incredible performances. <br /> <br />
