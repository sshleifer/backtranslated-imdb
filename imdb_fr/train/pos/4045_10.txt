I'm so happy to have had the chance to see this rare gem of a movie. I saw him at an independent film festival, so do not expect him to come to your city any time soon. During the movie, I noticed that about 10 people were standing up and going out. Too bad for them (here in the south, people do not like to have to read the subtitles). The film starts slowly, but its dialogue is so rich that I never got bored. When the action finally arrived, I found myself stuck on the screen as if I was climbing a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also had a good kick for chapter titles appearing before the chapters, especially those with the characters as they appear on the screen. It reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you played level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "video games / comics" movies, then I am happy.
