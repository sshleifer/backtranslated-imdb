Just a comment on the accents of New Orleans ... <br /> <br /> Another comment had already noted the following: "This film could have been shot in New York or in another big northern city from the country as it features characters who speak more like "broklynese" than perhaps a southern accent, one could hear in this part of the country. "An English critic also commented in the same direction. <br /> <br /> Many New Orleans residents actually sound "broklynese". I never discovered why. (He is mentioned in John Kennedy Toole's "A Confederacy of Dunces".) I always appreciate the films taking place in New Orleans that include this detail, like this one. Too often, it's just the Hollywood version of the Southern Standard Accent.
