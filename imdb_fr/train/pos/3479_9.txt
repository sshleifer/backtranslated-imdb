This show started with great episodes of mystery. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the series started playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change the episodes of 20 minutes into short episodes. Some of the voice actors have become unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes, because the first actress who played Velma was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network commissioned the studio Hanna Barbera to create more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby doo, and Scrappy doo, because the ratings were high. So they had to do more shorts. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. It's still a good show.
