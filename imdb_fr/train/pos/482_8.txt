It is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with a sensitive artistic sense. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of time and place. (The Lake District of Italy in the Twenties.) It's a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and believable. The sets are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes - the funerary ship in the fog - the long and long height plan of the chess table in the middle of a tiled floor with intricate patterns - are beautiful pictures. And rather than the obligatory happy ending, this story has a sweet sweet. If film is an art, it's almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
