It's a good movie, a good family film to watch if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie to be literally textual, you will be very very disappointed. I was a little disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> This is a newcomer to town, Billy. He makes a bet with the school bully and the bet is not like most bets. Billy has to eat 10 worms in one day or the bully wins. <br /> <br /> The acting game is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. Young actors exaggerate on many things. They think it's apocalypse if Billy does not eat worms. Hallie Eisenberg, however, did a magnificent job. <br /> <br /> The plot is good as a movie, but it's bad as a book adaptation. I was able to watch this movie without looking at the time .... sometimes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good family film with some weak points. I note this movie 7/10.
