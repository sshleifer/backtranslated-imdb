David Beckham is a British football star and Victoria Beckham's husband ("Posh Spice" of the Spice Girls). His trademark is a shot on goal that bends through the field and into the net. The football equivalent of an inimitable curved ball in baseball. "Bend it like Beckham" means doing this type of spectacular shooting. Apart from that, with a small shrine in the main character's room and a fake cameo at the end, the movie has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of little soccer jokes, like the gift that one of the character's parents gave him in a jersey number 9 (property of the great Mia Hamm, for connoisseurs) , references to "Posh 'n' Becks" the video tribute to one of the characters of the WUSA plays for an unbeliever friend ("They * have * that ??"), lesbian gags, bra gags sports, etc. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenager in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a football star. She has a real gift, but she has to overcome two seemingly insurmountable obstacles: the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their fascination for our WUSA) and her parents, Indian immigrants established in a very old fashioned way. that do not allow girls, among other things, to engage in contact sports. The girl's family is described as a fun character, but with great affection - think of My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to sitcom sitcoms to hide the growing celebrity of their football.
