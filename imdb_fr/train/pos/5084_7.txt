I was surprised to find that '' The Secret Fury '' was a nice good movie ...... Probably because I had no expectations for this movie ..... Although the movie has its holes in the plot ..... I would say you can not guess who was behind the whole scenario, until the very end of the movie ..... At first I thought it was Robert Ryan, who used the same method, like 'Gaslight' where the husband tries to make his wife crazy, but I was wrong ...... The main problem with the movie is that they go in another direction , which gave no clue at the beginning. ..... I thought that Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert were doing their roles well ... In addition, Vivian Vance, a great actress, who steals scenes from it ...... Those who love movies, that prevents you from guessing, you'll like this one ......
