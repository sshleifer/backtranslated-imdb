Like many race drivers, Dark Angel's opener shows a mix of potential and difficulty finding his own. This is certainly not unusual, but it seems that it would have worked better if the story had been narrowed and focused a little more. In today's world where you have to do something that has to be immediately captured or canceled, the series was a little bit misguided by not showing up at least half way, the guns flaming. <br /> <br /> The ninety-minute driver really feels like two episodes stuck together, and both episodes have a problem of focus. In the first half, we are introduced to Max and know what motivates her. We also have some interesting routines with Max that uses his abilities to win bets, interact with a POI, or solve domestic problems of his colleagues. The problem here is that it is not extraordinary for a human being with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise. <br /> <br /> It is when we arrive in the second period that we get a goal and focus story. In both periods, Max is at the center of the attention of a pirate journalist who feels that it is life's mission to save the world by exposing a dirty dealer at a time. In the second half, the repercussions catch up with him and Max reluctantly cleans up the mess that results. This sets the stage for the rest of the series, and it works, but it does not really click if you know what I mean. It's as if most of the pieces are there, but a couple who make a complete picture have been left out. Maybe they are filled with later episodes, but that's beside the question. The fact is that the content of this episode could easily have been told in less than twenty-eight minutes. <br /> <br /> The last negative point is that many of the media are totally unexpected. Original Cindy in particular is an annoyance, and I doubt that it has changed in the next twenty episodes. Although acting is not as bad as daytime soap, it is not of such quality as I would recommend. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but she is not convincing when history needs it the least. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the principle and values ​​of production are excellent. In fact, this series was considered quite expensive to produce and it is regrettable that it was canceled to be replaced by another program that did not last an entire season. Especially when there was enough time for both shows - they could have just canceled one of the garbage they whipped under the banner of reality TV. The fact is, we need more programs like Dark Angel, where the imagination is drawn by the imagination and not by the bidding. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave the pilot of the Dark Angel series seven out of ten. It never exceeds the level of disposable television and has never had the chance to realize its potential during its own period. But the potential is there and it's often all that matters to the drivers.
