... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the Kim Novak version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, even though the Novak version has a more consistent story. <br /> <br /> However: Davis' Mildred's raw emotions seem to me more suitable for a sluttish girl who seems to easily become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> It is these raw emotions that are a part of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, failure, "otherness" - strong emotions that he suppresses. Davis' Mildred, on the contrary, displays his emotions immediately and without censorship. She has no sense of hopelessness, failure, or "otherness"; she simply survives as a poor Cockney woman in Victorian times. <br /> <br /> The Novak performance was a more vulnerable Mildred than Davis, almost throughout the film. Davis' Mildred was ** never ** vulnerable until she had to see a doctor and beg for help. And when he revels her - for her way of keeping her body and soul and constantly enjoying her love for her - she unleashes the most passionate repudiation of the poshest attitude ever seen on the screen: " I wiped my mouth I wiped my mouth !! "Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis's realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb votes agree!
