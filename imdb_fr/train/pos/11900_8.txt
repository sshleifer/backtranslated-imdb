Both visually and musically beautiful. A treat for the eyes and ears. The Victorian element par excellence of the first sequences was completely enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene which Dickens himself would have been rightly proud. Technically, the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are imagined and creatively conceived in a traditional staging. The dance of many leading artists is breathtaking. The photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the high technical level used. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas time and a most enjoyable discovery that will withstand multiple viewing.
