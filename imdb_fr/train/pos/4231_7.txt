Coming home from a shopping trip on Christmas Eve, an abused suburban housewife (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle for survival after a dispute with a group of young offenders takes a violent turn. <br /> <br /> Suffering from the unworthiness of a Directly on DVD in the UK, the debut as a director of Susan Montford may not receive the recognition it deserves. It's a shame, because the quality of writing, directing and directing is very good and certainly exceeds the quality of your average DVD format. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her best performance for some time as an oppressed wife of a violent husband (Craig Sheffer). Although Sheffer really has nothing to do more than a threatening presence, it is in their brief scenes together that Basinger connects - showing a painful vulnerability while alluding to the rage that will eventually break in his clashes with young people. This is a really great performance and discreet, its transformation from victim to aggressor is done without a hitch. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas Initially, I thought it was a mistake because he (along with the other three kids) did not seem to have much of a threat. However, had the four youngsters been more physically imposing, the later scenes in which Basinger would turn against them would not have worked at all. The fact that it is about four average men, although slightly disturbed, explains why the film works as well. <br /> <br /> Aside from some stimulation problems during the second half of the film and a Here and There, here we have a fantastic movie that gives the viewer time to think about the end of the film. Some may be put off by the slow nature of the opening scenes or the abrupt end. Others by sometimes brutal violence. I say, give yourself a chance, it's certainly more deserving of your time than Saw V.
