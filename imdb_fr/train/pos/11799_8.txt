A well presented summary of a real event! In fact, I was not there, but I think that's the way things went. I think there are two typical American positions evident in the film: "communistophobia" and parallels to Adolf Hitler. These should be obvious to most independent observers. Be that as it may, Boothe achieves an excellent performance, as do many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie are unbearable - and I really mean it! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - everything happened and it probably looked like that). But in reality, this last scene of the air station did it really take place?
