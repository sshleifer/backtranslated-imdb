to look at this as a child. Although I probably find it awful now, it was pretty scary because I was only seven years old. I also remember working on a Saturday afternoon enigma watching her, so I was not really paying attention. However, the scene with the rocks that roll has been engraved in my mind ever since. I asked many people if they had seen this movie but to no avail. Twelve years ago, one person mentioned having seen it before, but thought it was just a dream. a fantasy like the wind. It's not a dream, my friend. No dream now. Once again, I have not seen it since, but I can not wait to find a copy and put it in my VCR. Anything that can stay in my mind for 23 years deserves a "10".
