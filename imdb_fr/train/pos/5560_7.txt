SPOILERS <br /> <br /> One of my friends said that NEXT MOVIE was Cheech & Chong's best film and went out of their way to take it, along with THE BLUE BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, does not have a rhythm, really does not have anything that defines a movie ... but it's funny. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little paragraph that I put in the plot, but being four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that can start a story. I will simply say that Cheech's cousin is coming. <br /> <br /> Have not there been other more fun moments when Chong made Cheech drink twice? What about the rooster? The first appearance in this film Pee-Wee Herman? You should watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE has enough bullets to make it awesome, but the movie has heart and hey, buddy let me borrow it to get a 7.
