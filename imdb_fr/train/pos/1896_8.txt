Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and help with the horses during the team's stage has recently passed away. If you look fast, you can see Frank Graham in the background of the restaurant scene while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was a champion of equestrian sports and will be missed by all who knew him. <br /> <br /> Second, I knew the real life Arthur Bach. He was not as rich as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life essentially as a child. His parents controlled his purse strings tightly, but his rent and utilities were paid for in an apartment in the basement of Greenwich Village. He spent a good deal of his time drinking various liquor and showing himself in public, as does Dudley Moore. <br /> <br /> Wonder with Arthur is why one would care about his wealth. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a very charming person when you got to know him. In fact, it was almost a constraint to be charming. He could not buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish a certain level of relationship with the seller. He has spent his life being a perfect guest at the party. The wastrel term that was commonly used in the 19th century would apply to him. <br /> <br /> And that's what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore, John Gielgud is responsible for cleaning everything up after him. It's a full-time job, as we see in Arthur. My friend has also never found Liza Minnelli, a man, Liza Minnelli, because he was gay. The portrait of Arthur Bach by Still Moore is extremely precise and real for me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, a twentieth century wastrel, is forced to marry another baby from the trust to Jill Eikenberry. Since he will not work for a living, the threat of being cut is real to him. He has only his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and the driver Bitterman played by Ted Post to express his troubles. We should all have such problems. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud is almost one hundred years old, but he probably worked better than in Arthur. In fact, Gielgud is best known for his stage performances. Yet 1981 was a year of feeling at the time of the Oscars. The Academy awarded Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn the Oscars of On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor award, mostly for lifetime work. This man was amazing, always at work almost to the end. <br /> <br /> It's for Frank Graham who worked in the film and for Jackie Weiss, a real life, Arthur, that I dedicate this criticism.
