Okay, it's not a perfect movie at all, but I do not share the general opinion of the IMDb that it's really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990s and I loved that time. I never saw 'Black Mask' at the time and I only saw it last week for the first time. Apart from the embarrassing dubbing that my DVD copy did not give me the opportunity to turn off, the film contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated the Hong Kong movies during this time. I remain true to my opinion: for action, these guys, whatever their budget, add a magical element on the screen: Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I do not hit them). the movies - I just think they lack the spontaneity of it and feel too regulated). What is it? This is the feeling that filmmakers experienced as they turned and climbed, not afraid to leave flaws in order to learn lessons for next time. For me, watching movies is all the more fun and dangerous.
