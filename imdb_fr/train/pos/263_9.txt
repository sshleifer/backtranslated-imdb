It was a strong Poirot / Suchet, television mystery selection. The characters were lively and well played. The plot and the main setting - a student hostel - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but for me it did not distract me. An important point, many viewers Poirot do not recognize a good acting or a good characterization. I also think they are pretty tough in their judgments on some of Poirot's mysteries. Finally, I've read a few Christie novels - none in recent years - and I find it annoying that so many viewers are unhappy with the changes to the novel. Please, spectators, consider what is presented to you on a movie, not what you think should be there. That said, the mysteries of Poirot vary in quality, but not as much as critics and evaluators would have you believe. With the singular exception of The Five Little Pigs, whose script, character, and theme were fabulous, Poirot's long films are neither good nor bad. For the record, I saw all the longer Poirot / Suchet movies. Finally, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence. However, their presence is either unwelcome (almost always with Japp), or unrelated to Hastings. The lemon is in the middle.
