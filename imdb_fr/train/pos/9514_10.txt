It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. Hanks, Newman and everyone else are playing very well. The best performance of Jude Law. The cinematography is excellent, the editing is about as good and includes a beautiful original score that really fits the mood of the film. The design of the production is also a factor that makes this film special. For me, beating Godfather requires a lot, but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest. Certainly a candidate for the best film in my book.
