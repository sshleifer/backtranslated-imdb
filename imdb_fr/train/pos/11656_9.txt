I saw some movies about eating disorders, but this one was definitely my favorite. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders in the end improve or automatically accept the fact that they need help and that's it. I thought this movie was more realistic because in this one, the main character, Lexi, did not improve automatically. She gets better and then has a disadvantage. I think this movie shows more than others that I've seen that improvement does not just happen, that it's hard work and takes time, that the road is long to recover. I think this movie shows all of this very well. There should be more movies like this one.
