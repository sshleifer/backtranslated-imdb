The beauty and the wonderful appeal of clara bow are the main reason to watch this movie. "hula" is not quite up to the best movies of clara but is nice. she dances, she rides and pursues the man she loves. This film has a duration of just over an hour and was directed by the future winner of an Oscar, victor fleming (carried by the wind). The film moves quickly and clara bow has a lot of time on the screen. if you like clara, i would recommend "hula".
