"Convicts" is really a third act movie. The whole dialogue and the characterful interactions that occur there come from the long end-of-day day in the South. And, by extension, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years ago, they were working together on "The Trip to Bountiful", a movie that seems almost action-packed. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he is just barely on this adequate side. The slowness of the rhythm leaves much room for the director of photography, Toyomichi Kurita, who instils in common sense a light and a fragile heat. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a filmed piece, with little editing or directing the prowess, everything comes back to the acting. As far as I'm concerned, there are no faults here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters quite real, indifferent to life. Lukas Haas, a young actor I knew in "Testament" and "Witness", plays a character very similar to his other leading roles. He is calm, withdrawn, slightly frightened and sad, in one way or another. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a title like "Convicts" night to this film. This title, as well as the opening scene, seem to create an image of a western-type image much more complex. If theatrical productions with slow rhythm do not interest you very much, you will also want to transmit this one. Otherwise, it may be exactly the movie you want them to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it.
