I have personally seen many Disney movies in my life, though none of them match Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although personally I would not have crossed the real animation with the animation, it was an improvement to try to dress people in animated characters. The film opposes three evacuees of World War II who are sent with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country. I must say that the casting was brilliant. Angela Landsbury performed a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson sparked the desperate interest of the artist. The ends always surprise me and that was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know if it was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but since it was designed to be a children's movie, that's fine. Overall, I would give nine out of ten performances, dialogue six times out of ten, casting nine out of ten and costumes eight out of ten.
