"Kalifornia" is one of my favorite movies of all time and could easily be described as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very elegant surface, but behind are many disturbing and honest descriptions murderous maniacs and the terrifying violence they inflict on others. One of the strongest aspects of the film is his performance, Brad Pitt is surprisingly great as a trailer-trash psychopath named Early. Pitt recounts his scary character almost flawless. Juliette Lewis is just as good at playing with his naive girlfriend, his innocence is almost heartbreaking. "Kalifornia" has a very simple plot, moving slowly and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly plunges into a lethal frenzy, while Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are many shocking scenes and it all goes up to a peak of power station that will haunt you for days. "Kalifonia" is a film that you really have to watch for its intense gaze on the monstrosity of a human being, not just for its violence and gore.
