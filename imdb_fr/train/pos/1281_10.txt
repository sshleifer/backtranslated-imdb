This film is as good as hard to find. The film's hero (and screenwriter and director) is Simon Geist - a man "with a diary". He creates a fake magazine just to be able to question the Los Angeles pig - the actors, the models, the musicians - who believe that their own stools do not smell. Through intelligent dialogue, Zucovic succeeds in doing so. Of course, the budget of this film probably corresponds to what he paid for a used car, but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Anyone who can replenish Edward Munk's "Scream" like a silver basket at a local caf√© should be nominated for a type of award. Give this film a chance and listen to what it says ... because they have been making the same car since 1986 ... it's called "the car". Bravo, Zucovic, congratulations!
