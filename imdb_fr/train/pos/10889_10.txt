What are all the negative comments? After seeing this film for the first time tonight, I can only say that it's a good holiday comedy that will surely brighten the day of any lonely person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end up spending the holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You will have to see the movie if you want to know why. Also, although I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after a while, if you ask me, they were real snobs. However, this film made me smile and feel good inside. Before closing, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has had a resounding success. In conclusion, I highly recommend this good holiday comedy that will surely brighten the lives of any lonely person of any Ben Affleck fan or Christina Applegate who has not seen it.
