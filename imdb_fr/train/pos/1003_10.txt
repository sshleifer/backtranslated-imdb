Another Australian masterpiece, he plunges into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and he is doing very well. It does not use excessive special effects like American films, it focuses more on the emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. gives to see. This is the story of a couple who bought an old house that was supposed to house a very old woman who never went out and whose husband disappeared under mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house and John Adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
