I love movies and comics. The comics are different from those of the film, but I would give it anyway: 10 out of 10. It was great. If movies have become great. I will have his babies. And I am a woman. Read the comics, you will not regret it. Yes, in this film, since the death of Brian P., the artist for her is such a mediocre work of art. I mean seriously, do not get me wrong, these people did very well, but different versions for different people. Different traits for different people, as the saying goes. Any guy who does not complain about it is crazy or does not like women, or you just know how to plan insane. If I could count on my fingers with what love and how many times I read the comics, I would not miss any more fingers, but there are always toes.
