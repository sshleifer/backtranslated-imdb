Yes, the plot is predictable. yes, there are some holes of ground; yes, it has a quality made for television; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" the book with obvious self-promotion. <br /> <br /> But forget all this ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Have fun in a school outing A little special, but fun anyway. <br /> <br /> Virginia Madsen as a mother does a great job ... so good that I'm going to start watching her movies. She reminded me of Diane Lane for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is doing a good job too. If I were a casting agent, I would look for some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are above the usual TV standards and the music was really great ... better than several big budget movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you fancy black german, this movie does not suit you. If you want a safe, fun and underrated movie, it's a good movie. This is an example you could show your 10-year-old daughter, but enjoy it too.
