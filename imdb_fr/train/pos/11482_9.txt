This film is mainly shot on a portable camera by the actors. In some ways, a dummy journal in other respects, a video journal of killers, it's full because of a "Columbine" style attack. Although this film does not answer all the big questions, it gives you an idea of ​​the ease with which you can escape. Throughout the film, you are shown how actors have illegally shortened rifles, made homemade bombs and developed an action plan for "Zero Day". The actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, obviously borrowing a lot from their own lives, but I never detected them as really playing (Something Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was great, but I'm not sure if we needed the very last scene. Overall, it's a very good movie on a very difficult subject.
