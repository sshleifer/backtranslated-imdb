This film took me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "girls movie". Boy, was he wrong! This film has a great appeal for the family, without sex scenes like _other_ movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job in Homer Hickam's shoes. The support troop is also excellent. <br /> <br /> Science, transition to adulthood, family quarrels, big stage of the train ... This film has it all. The soundtrack is good, even if the score is presented rather jerkily. The music of the 50's gives the film the edge of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD is really worth it. The reading quality is excellent - I've seen it many times before.
