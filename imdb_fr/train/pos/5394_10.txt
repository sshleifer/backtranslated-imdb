I was absolutely fascinated by this series from the moment Tom Long came on the scene - all the "bad boy" stuff was just addictive. <br /> <br /> The story caught you, what's going to happen next - Joey get the girl at the end, after 5 years in jail and all that time thinking about her lost love, to meet her again, to find her son ... Even if he is a violent villain, you still want him to find happiness. <br /> <br /> Two really captivating titles - bring it on video!
