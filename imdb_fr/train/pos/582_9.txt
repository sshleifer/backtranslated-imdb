As a habit, I always like to read the "hated" reviews of all movies. especially the one I would like to comment on. and it's not really a point-counterpoint agreement; I would just like to see what people are saying on the flipside. <br /> <br /> However, I want to talk about one thing. many people who hated him called it, to paraphrase, "beautiful, but superficial", some even going so far as to say that the desire for this norm, but the inability to help one's brother, was at best a banal plot. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a brother or sister who suffers from a similar dysfunction, I can tell you. every day you see them abusing themselves, knowing only that their current trajectory will inevitably lead to self-destruction. and it's not about the details of what they did when; how or why paul decided to play the game and associate with dubious people; it's really more how they are wired. They are, on the one hand, real geniuses and, on the other hand, extremely self-destructive (it's a bit like people like Howard Hughes, the same forces that drive them are the same ones that tear them apart) and all that you see that, you know it, and even worse, you realize you can not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> For Norman MacLean, a river was crossing it was probably a way to find an answer to the question of why the tragedy should happen, and who was to blame. in the end, nobody is, and often, there is no why. but it takes a lot of personal anxiety to really achieve this realization. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never comes at all.
