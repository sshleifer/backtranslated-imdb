I bought "All Saints Day" and it's not really a horrible film, but a lot could have been better. It had a lot of historical value, played by very talented actresses / actors, and it is not a daily event that actors can play such a role and make it credible. Some parts were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I would not say that the whole movie was awful. Once you've thought about that, captured New Orleans in the nineteenth century and pulling something out, it's very difficult and much harder to find actors that can strongly signify those parts. But the only big problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors who played the role of free-color characters were mostly light-skinned Africans, not very universal to use others who did not not clear skin; one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists. Whoever did the casting could have chosen a wider variety in terms of hue, despite the fact that many creoles are aware of the colors. Choosing rather actors who looked very white could have been more thoughtful. The actors did a great job, the script I could have written better and, overall, I found the performances very believable.
