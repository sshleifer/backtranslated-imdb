A nice story about following your dreams and trying to do something about them when the opportunity arises. Nothing was easy for Morris either - he had a family, a job, job opportunities elsewhere, a mortgage, and so on. - it was not like he could just drop what he was doing and ride happily on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It took courage. I am glad they showed his indecision, almost until he received the call of the majors. <br /> <br /> I remember watching him play against the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Although Morris is more like John Kruk or a Watson Watson than Quaid, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job playing with the man, the teacher, the coach and the "oldest beginner" .... as a person belonging to the same group of age, I can certainly identify his difficult situation. You're not old enough to do what you dreamed when you were a child, but that's it. You must do it earlier than the legislator. <br /> <br /> It's well said, beautifully edited, paced, played, happy to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work at all levels, happy to see him hit. <br /> <br /> *** outta **** ... who would have thought the Tampa Devil Rays would have been such a good movie at first?
