<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. When we watch the movie, they may feel that the fight scenes are only of a mediocre nature, but no matter, it's the attitude and the atmosphere that matter. This great movie has both !! Still trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and places them in a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" frame. However, these are not the light comic incarnations you might see in a Jet Li movie. Instead, these guys are fighting to death with brutal results. What makes the film even better is that anyone can die at any time, there is no restraint. Too bad, they do not make movies like this more often.
