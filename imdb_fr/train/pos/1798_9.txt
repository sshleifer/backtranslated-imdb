I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival, and it's a film that sticks to the skin, it really stayed with me. Adapted very intelligently from what is probably an excellent novel, it is a drama of back and forth over time with well-rounded characters, a thoughtful rumination about life choices, and I do not exaggerate . one of the biggest roles ever assembled in more than 100 years of filming. A wonderful work from everyone, led by a luminous Vanessa Redgrave, dying and misleading Newport Matrix, and Claire Danes, much younger. Meryl Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, is, like Mama, the real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and does not play too much; and what a pleasure to see great actors like Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins who bring sharp, detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, also of the scene, does not add much to the clich√©d role of a rich and unfortunate wastrel, and the family problems are solved perhaps more properly than the real life allowed. But it's a visually stunning meditation, visually punctuated, about real-life issues, and you can cry without feeling like you're being carelessly manipulated. Also, what a sumptuous automobile show of 1940/50.
