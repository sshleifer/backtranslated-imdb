"The Last Hard Men" is a typical Western of the 70s. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this one, but director Andrew McLaglan is a pupil of John Ford and this can obviously be shown in several scenes. IMO the beginning is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the public a journey from civilization to nature. In the third part, there are illogical defects and I complain a little bit about Charlton Heston. He must play an old ex-jurist named Sam Burgade, but he is in a fantastic physical form. I never felt like he was really struggling to climb a horse or a rock. For me, he does not look very motivated as he usually does in most of his epic films. Ditto for the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the sheriff's daughter. Maybe both of them had problems with the director or were not happy with their roles. Hershey and Coburn do not show their best performance, but they are still good. If the writer had John Wayne in their minds as Sam Burgade? Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is also a bit underused in his role. On his side, James Coburn, the outlaw of Zach Provo. Coburn is a very big villain in this one. He portrays the villain between manic hatred and intelligence. His role and acting are the best of the film. <br /> <br /> The landscapes and the shootings are fantastic. The shooting scenes are bloody and the violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical Western action in the middle of the film. I would have enjoyed a bank robbery or something similar. All in all, it's an entertaining Western movie. This is not a good film but above average because of a good Coburn, a very good start and bloody and violent scenes.
