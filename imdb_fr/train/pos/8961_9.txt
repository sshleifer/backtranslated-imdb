Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great phenomena of pop culture of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena we know today (in the 70s - more than ten years later - references to this film were infinite). That makes Novak a huge star, adds an interesting article to Jack Lemon's resume, sheds new light on Jimmy Stewart and gives Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both continue to play witches and other curious "old bats" "in movies and on television). <br /> <br /> Parallel to the 40's film, I Married a Witch (who helped make Veronica Lake an icon ), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the great fascination of cinema and television These are magic things that started with Bewitched and continued with Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> What I rarely see is that the film is also a rather interesting alternative film, the story unfolds during the Christmas holidays and, although it is superficially witchcraft, it actually embodies a great deal of spirit Christmas (gift, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always watch this film (I have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90s), especially if it is broadcast just after the end of year celebrations. He has style, substance, excellent distribution and extraordinary production values. And, like Adam's Rib, he casually expresses rather radical ideas for his time, which are still so (in both films, the female character is impotent and powerful) and therefore always seems ahead of his time.
