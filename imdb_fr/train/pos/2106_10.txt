Were these more romantic comedies as skillfully executed as this one? I had never thought that things as banal as the mere sale of a music box could let me hold my breath with excitement. Margaret Sullavan is a wonderful saleswoman. She and James Stewart have always exceled. This film presents what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" to his credit, that says a lot. The way he found a partner for the Christmas dinner left me dizzy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought "Trouble In Paradise" was his favorite, but it must surely be considered a triumph. With the most spiritual dialogue that American films of the 30s can offer.
