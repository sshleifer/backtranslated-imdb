The film is very realistic. Absolutely, this does not belong to the genre of Hollywood cinema where each line must be pronounced perfectly and where each movement is precise. The actors who play the roles of the lovers do an excellent job that represents the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their adventures of everyday life. Overall, the film reaches the viewer in a depressed state. This is where the realism of the whole story is obvious. Everything does not happen as we think. I can say however that the film does not end on a bad note. We watch, we learn, we experience each other. This is probably the moral of this story.
