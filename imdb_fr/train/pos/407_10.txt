Oh my god ... Just give me a minute to breathe. This film takes you on a fantastic adventure and will not let you go until the last shot you take to your face. This is the movie for fans of Stormriders and others. Legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I did not like certain things, they used a lot of stand in. I wanted to see the real person fight but, well ... Some small mistakes, and I did not really like it until I looked at it again. I encourage anyone who has always wanted to see a real Asian movie, to see this movie. I give this film one of my best ratings. Go see him when he comes out in America !!!
