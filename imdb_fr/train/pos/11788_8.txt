I really think people take the wrong approach in this one. First of all, I find this short film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think that the suspense and the mystery are ingenious in their insinuation on the observer. Another thing that struck me is that the viewer is immediately involved, even if there is no clear story, but only allusions, pauses and emotions expressed by the characters, which gives you somehow the impression that there is a story at all. past. No one else could have done it better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism. Of course, I agree with anyone that people who start watching this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work on the part of the viewer will be disappointed. And rightly. Lynch is not about it. At least that side of Lynch is not. The one who has contributed to the making of Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is at its peak and people who expect to be entertained as if they were looking at something else will simply not understand what it is. My opinion is that Darkened Room consists of playing with your animal core, your instinctive self, giving you the means (image, sound, situation) by which you react instinctively. It is not a question of pleasure, but of the desired reaction. And that, my friend, is pure art.
