This film is amazing. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde, after growing up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not play. <br /> <br /> In this film, a young Sho (Gackt) meets a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an improbable friendship. Kei suffers because of the way he is forced to live by others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad film, but not dark. The plot was very unique and unlike your typical vampire movie. The scenario was full of twists and very haunting. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I would say that the film had, despite its lack of happy ending - though peaceful - would be its multiple languages. I had the version not submitted (I'm lucky to have understood everything except Cantonese), so I would advise you with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was just great.
