It's probably one of the most original love stories I've known for centuries, especially for a (briefly) war-based film. Basically, this is a story based on two worlds, one real and the other fictional, but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only a coincidence if it is a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) was going to crash into a plane, he spoke to June (Kim Hunter of The Planet of the Apes) before bailing out and saying he loved him. He was supposed to die jumping without a parachute, but he survived. He sees and loves June now in the flesh. This other place, like a paradise, is unhappy because it survived and was supposed to come into their world. So they sent the French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to leave, but he is obviously in love. Peter suggests that he appeal to keep his life in the court of the other world, it is granted. Obviously, love prevails when the two lovers announce that they will die for each other, June even proposes to take his place! Robert Coote in the role of Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron in An Angel, a brief Lord Sir Richard Attenborough (still unknown) in the role of English pilot and Abraham Sofaer as The Judge / The Surgeon. David Niven was number 36 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for his happy ending, he was number 47 on The 100 Greatest War Films, he was number 46 on The 50 Greatest British Films and it was number 59 on the 100 biggest movies. Exceptional!
