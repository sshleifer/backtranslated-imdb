Amazingly good. The acting was fun, the script was fun, the music was fun, the plot was incredibly fun. It was a fun movie to watch and rest your brain. Some parts of the plot and quotes seemed to me very creative. 7 out of 10. In fact, for what it was, it would deserve a 10 out of 10. You're not supposed to compare that to a fictional movie or a bloody movie.
