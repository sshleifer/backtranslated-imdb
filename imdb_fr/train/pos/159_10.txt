It was just another wonderful film from the Berlin Film Festival. But unlike Sally Potter's "Yes," which I had seen a few days before, where, after leaving the cinema, I felt a strong desire to want to embrace the whole world and who was just happy to be in life, but this time it's just the opposite happened: there was something that dragged me down and suddenly looked cold and hard to breathe. It was as if, all of a sudden, there was nothing left, all hope, all future had been taken to a dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed to be dreary and locked up, but on a beautiful day, there's that kind of luminosity that opens the horizon and makes her believe in the realization of her dreams. There was no one at her side, but suddenly she finds a companion, coming from nothing, someone who has been able to share the most hidden feelings of her life. This person was Toni, a wandering girl who does not seem to have roots, just like herself. <br /> <br /> But the title of the film is "Ghosts", and the ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no way to keep them ?? Ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are perceived only by yourself, hiding away from everyone else. Francoise, a French woman, is the victim of such ghosts. Once, she lost her child daughter in Berlin, which had apparently been stolen from her in a supermarket, in a moment of inattention. Now, time has passed and Françoise is back in Berlin, looking for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina could be this child, after all, she has the same scar in her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades, which seems to prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina adopts this idea. After all, she does not only need a companion, she also needs a mother. But in the end, she has her hands empty, Toni disappeared with a man and her supposed mother turns out to be a sick woman. "Marie is dead," concludes her husband, and the statement could not be more disappointing. Nina is just a "niña", an unnamed girl, there is no hope of divine fulfillment. There is no Mary in this world to accompany our lonely lives. Therefore, in the end, we see Nina alone, about to walk on the road that opened before her, in a future that seems joyless and uncertain.
