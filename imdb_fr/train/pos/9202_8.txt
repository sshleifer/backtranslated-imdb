It must be admitted that Dev has an eye on beauty and talent. He gave a break to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also a former beauty pageant winner, entrusting her with a bespoke role for her debut. His eyeglass, smashed, and swaying face hypnotizing music, made it an instant darling of viewers. This film is a feast for the eyes, with its picturesque landscapes, its ethnic groups, these temples Buddha and his humorous pervert Mumtaz, who looks very attractive, in his ethnic dress and his dancing skills. Dev is of course, adorable, and this is one of his commercial performances. Hare Rama manages to maintain interest, with his carefully written script, editing and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, his other film, Anand dealt with the subject of young people who are used to becoming addicts, and the theory that they come from troubled families and a troubled childhood is quite plausible. A good artist, this film keeps its freshness until the date!
