Sublimity is the way to reach beauty. And the film is made of sublime. If it's not his best, it's the most beloved of all Bogdanovich's films. <br /> <br /> This unique masterpiece reminds us, like most of the director's other films, what life is (or should be): love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. As a song to which the film derives its title (the well-known composition of Gershwin), the film makes the impossible true and tries to make us understand that no one can judge anyone; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without line of dialogue, built on the eyes and the sight of the characters - with the one "Bogdanovich touch" based on the point of view - is a course on the language of cinema, something that PB has learned from his admired directors of the Golden Age of the Movies). With superb distribution and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of Sinatra's "Trilogy"), this film is full of self-awareness and compassion, and far from self-indulgence and emptiness (as wrote some critics), deserves a better spot on the history of American cinema than where it was placed. It is not "long on the style, runs on the bottom": it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
