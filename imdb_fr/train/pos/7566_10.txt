The girl's name is Bonnie (Polay). She is attractive, apparently leading a pretty decent life, but suddenly she is inexplicably torn from her home and her life by Evil Dude and Various and Sundry Evil Henchmen. Now she has no idea what's going on, except for a group of people with toothbrushes who want her apparently dead ... and she's going to die without even knowing why. <br /> <br /> God, I hear moans all the time. Now that the content is so inexpensive to produce and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there will be no one to make sure there is a quality standard! We are going to drown ourselves in the shit! The only people who really think that these are people who have not seen any movie or read a book recently - because we are already doing the stupidity of a dead man in shit. These are people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who refute these ignorant so-sisters-sisters by throwing $ 8,000 on the table and doing ... well, what I would say is a better action movie than anything you've seen in movie theaters year ... but you have not seen any action movies at the movies this year. I saw the box office. You stay in mass. You'd better get a copy, spend twenty minutes entertaining yourself, and continue your life. <br /> <br /> It's pure entertainment. You enter, like Bonnie, with a lot of questions and the end result is nebulous. All the vanity has already been achieved in many ways, but not in such a short period of time and without such a concentration of tasty cannonballs. You are here for the atmosphere, the mystery and the guns. That's all, that's all the filmmakers promise and they keep their promises. <br /> <br /> It's heart-warming to tell me that it was done with such a budget. We've had a good number of independent films, but we rarely see anything as polished as this short film, and we've never seen it in the kind of action that's so beautiful. God, you can put those two guys back, MI: 3 and that could attract me. The Bond franchise. Hell, anything. No, actually, even better: I'd like to see these guys make a feature film and stay away from Hollywood. Anything that kills the film industry is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> The best independent movie we've seen in a while and the best independent calling card we've ever seen. The DVD costs $ 20 and has additional features. Go get your movie ticket budget and direct it to this one.
