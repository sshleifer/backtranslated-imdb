***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What scares you? Killer sharks, or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message? Maybe a psychopath brandishing a chain saw? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears do not even compare to a horror that people do not dare to speak or talk about - it's the death of one's own child. "Pet Sematary" exploits this fear, the fear of primal adults, and then takes it to places that most people would not be able to handle. <br /> <br /> I read some comments about this movie that include mediocre acts, stupid characters, and so on. I do not agree. The acting is actually top notch for a movie like this. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But the events of the film are not only logical, they can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible. This is the real horror of "Pet Sematary": it's not that pets and people come back from the dead like evil killers who hunt with a knife and scalpel, it's that anyone who lost a child could become desperate enough to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does. Despite warnings, even past history. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who wish to go to the bottom of a desperate human heart. The heart of a protector who tries to compensate for his inability to protect. And the results are horrible. In fact, when the movie plunges into slasher territory towards the end, it's almost a disappointment, although I think it makes perfect sense to know how he got there. <br /> <br /> I'm a real horror movie fan, and I argue that is one of the scariest horror movies ever made. If you do not think so, review it after your children.
