Of course, it was well done and well done, very well done and well done! But the story was so weak. And Lincoln's representation was even weaker. Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was a loonie. Do you mean that Lincoln was a lazy sage, without any respect for the law or the court? I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll call you Jackass then" ???? I understand that Ford was looking for a superhero but I did not like him at all. He cheats in sports, speaks like a real idiot and does not seem to know how to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously? <br /> <br /> The twist was even lower. I mean come! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed to have been imagined by a 5 year old in his dreams. To say that I liked it enough, it was very funny and made me laugh a lot, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must say that I must say that I must say that it is good enough, nothing that amuses me and makes me laugh can not be bad BUT this living and stupid story was so ridiculous that I do not understand how someone one could think of it as great. <Br /> <br /> I have no idea of ​​the historical accuracy of this film, but if it were true, I should really shake my head.
