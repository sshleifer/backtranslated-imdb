In Cinema Retro's No. 2 magazine, it is revealed that Mark Lester's voice was dubbed by 20-year-old Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all satisfied with her singing skills. The secret was revealed by a 2004 British documentary entitled "Oliver! After They Were Famous". Greene was paid 400 pounds for her work and she had to agree to keep her participation secret, just like Mark Lester. They kept their word and only revealed this fact as part of the TV show decades after the film's release. For the record, Mark Lester retired and is a practicing osteopath in England.
