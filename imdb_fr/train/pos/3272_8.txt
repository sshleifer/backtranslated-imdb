Coming from the same director who did "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised that this is a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a film I've never heard of before, but it must be one of the best films of the late 80s - partly because it's the worst cinema period of recent decades. (Do not talk about "cinema" Iranian or Swedish here ...) The acting is not brilliant, but simply solid - contrary to what some people claim here (they had to dream of this "wonderful game", a bit like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end intelligently and perfectly connects all loose ends. These unanswered questions are probably left there voluntarily, leaving the individual to the interpretation, and there is nothing wrong with that with a theme like this. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mix of children's and horror movies, with effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the main character is not your socially banished, ultra-shy, but secretly-brilliant girl, typical of cinema, but a normal, normal kid; very refreshing. I'm fed up with writers projecting in their books and on their screens their own childhood, which looks like this, as if someone cares more about watching or reading about another lenient and lonely childhood as if it was all there or so. bottom of character holds the monopoly of good potential. The scene with Anna and the "kissing" boy (for a long time) was a bit heavy - evoking feelings of both disgust and amusement - as she was supposed to be only 11 years old but as it was predictable, Burke was 13 or 14 when it was filmed. I do not know why they did not improve the age of the character or recruit a younger actress. It was obvious that Burke was not so young. I will never know why filmmakers always make children older than what they play, which dilutes realism.
