I must say that Clive Barker's Undive is by far the best horror game ever created. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them captured the sheer joy with which this game tackles its horrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, it's attaching horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick, Undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title. I just wish it was done on a console system, but alas poor PC sales stifled it in the bud.
