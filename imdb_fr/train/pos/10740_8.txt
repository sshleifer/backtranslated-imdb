Made by French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and commented by Robert De Niro and firefighter James Hanlon, this tale is captivating and heartbreaking, showing how the best of New York shined on its darkest day. I saw this for the first time when I was young, na√Øve at age 12, and at that age, it still touched me. Knowing how serious 9/11 was, there was an extension of the 9/11 effect. We were discovering who the heroes were, how their daily lives were composed and how they threatened their lives in a situation where most people would just run and save their skin. These brave men risk their lives and watching this only increases my admiration for them. Look if you can, it's the best documentary I've ever seen.
