"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These shows, along with many other high-quality shows, prove that we are in the golden age of television history. "Lost" is a pure genius. Incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories, highlighted by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word to describe a television show), a soundtrack, outstanding performances and editing. Anyone who is not hooked on it loses one of the most important creative expressions of television. Watching only one episode a week can be a problem, but the DVD format is actually an amazing way to watch that. I hope they continue as before (as I'm sure they do).
