I must admit that in the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION collection, it must be the one I love the most, as well as another that I also examined. The story is something that stops you from watching. Many EROS movies have a hammer-like plot before producing it when you watch it. All centered around sex, and who can understand how many different people come at the end of the film. And oh my god, never look at one of those movies when someone pulls out a gun. It does not work if it's almost laughable, but you do not want to waste the energy to do it. <br /> <br /> "Losing Control" is exactly as the name suggests. The protagonist, the main character (the wonderful talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control a person exercises over his senses, body and feelings. And a man changes everything for her, in fact almost a different woman. But the mirror is broken at the same time. This is an excellent film that I wish I had first realized! <br /> <br /> 10/10
