{Spoilers possible to come ... you've been warned. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my all favorite musicals and movie musicals! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, it happens that the chandelier (not to mention the songs) of a show is lost in its transition from the stage to the stage. This is not usually the case here. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are larger than life and you can not help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely beautiful. (I'm so happy to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All actors "bounce" (ie they have unbeatable chemistry) to the perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the owners of the oldest permanent floating shit set up in New York and as the most notorious gambler who even bets on the tiniest things, like his fever that goes up to 104 if do not take. penicillin. Sweet and fresh, Jean Simmons is perfect for Sarah's role (although it's true, her singing instruments are not as remarkable as those of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - the missionary doll with a heart of gold heal everything. Last but not least (on my list anyway), Miss Vivian Blaine, resuming her role on Broadway as Miss Adelaide, singer and dancer Hot Box who wishes to finally end her 14 years of engagement with Nathan with the wedding she even the psychosomatic cold he gave him. <br /> <br /> First, congratulations to Stubby Kaye and BS Pulley as they resume their roles on Broadway as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two players as adorable as these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is superb, as usual, and although he does not have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it because he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role of Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" gives me chills every time I see him play the number. It's especially nice to hear him say, "Dad ... I have cider in my ear." <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role that suits her appearance, her voice and how she behaves. You cherish it so much, not only to win Sky (or, in the end, to believe it), but to help people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins, and to lead lives with God. His interpretation of "If I had a bell" is splendid, to say the least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is the man. He's so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings roles that Sam Levene of the Broadway cast never could (awesome actor, but the guy was your deaf ... go figure). I really enjoyed adding the song "Adelaide" ... I would like a guy to sing like that for me. Frankie's cool and clever behavior transcends the boundaries of this film. But more importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is only perfection in this role. From accent to her song "Adelaide's Lament", she is great. And she is also my favorite part of the whole movie. She really makes you feel for Adelaide ... especially when she cries just before, then again during "Sue Me". I have not decided yet whether I liked "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck" ... maybe I like them too. Anyway, she does a great job with them as well as "Take Back Your Mink". (I'm sad that they forgot "dutch" of the movie ...). She is absolutely wonderful, not to say hilarious, and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is their jargon. It's a mix of high class and street slang. They never use "it's", "I go" or "it's". It's always "it's", "I'm going" and "it's". Overall, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals of all time. This is a movie you should take the time to watch whenever this happens. My only complaint? No "Marry The Man Today". Now it's a good song.
