Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school student who discovers she has a powerful punch and begins amateur training at a Brooklyn gym. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, barely older than her, who also trains there. They meet after class, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex Santiago has been instructed to keep it for his next fight. <br /> <br /> They both participate in a "gender-blind" sports program that makes no distinction between men and women, a misguided attempt to level the playing field. . <br /> <br /> A conservative radio commentator recently announced - and I swear I do not invent it - "Let's face it, the president is black." I am here to make an equally insightful observation: "Men and women are different." In 99 cases out of 100, this has no impact on physical performance. But in the first percent - trained athletes whose skills have been perfected - men usually have the advantage. With their narrow hips, they can run faster. And they have greater muscle mass and the strength of the upper torso. These differences in body development allow women to give birth and raise children and men to catch and kill food for them. This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection. Without that, there might be no human at all. And it is for this reason, boys and girls, that they organize men's and women's events at the Olympic Games. I speak to you as your anthropologist. It will be ten cents, PayPal preferred. <br /> <br /> That's why I called this program blind blindness. As a talented boxer as Rodrigues, approaching the zenith of the game, she will eventually lose against a man. <br /> <br /> This is where the complication arises in this film. Rodrigues is finally facing his boyfriend Douglas. Neither of them wants to lose the wrath of the other, not to mention rotunda rights, but the pride of both is at stake, and the pride is both personal and gender. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what she considers to be his condescending attitude. It ends well. <br /> <br /> I did not really expect much from the movie. I thought it would be a scam of Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" until I discovered that it was published years ago. And I had never heard of the director or any of the performers. This kind of darkness generally suggests that the weeping men are badly made for television, etc. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised how well organized it is. The total absence of bathos left me speechless. It was the same for the minimal use of boxing clich√©s - the torn ropes, the blood, the swollen egg, the tired faces after the fight, the big and sweaty spectator who shouted "Kill him! nose, the sheaf of sweat from the battered head, the heroic music signaling the long-awaited apotheosis of the winner. None of this here - well, almost. The entire plot could be considered a formula. A tough kid finds an outlet in the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The impression you have left is that this is probably what these amateur competitions look like. Different from those we see on television and in ordinary movies. No ringing sounds, for example. Instead, a dancing and observing referee screams "Stop!" And "Box!" Competitors wear a helmet. The gym is populated not by a crowd of enthusiastic spectators, but only by a handful of people with a special interest in what is happening. It's a clean film, despite the rather sinister decor and unhappy family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez may look very mean, with her muscular mass and her eyes shining under her lowered forehead, but once you get used to the idea that it's a girl who can beat you forever, and once you hear the feminine contours of its supersegmentals, it is not bad. (A scene in which she beats her father on the floor is exaggerated.) It was a bit difficult to understand Douglas's restraint when Rodriguez crawled all over his bed. The director, Karyn Kusama, chose her talent with care. <br /> <br /> Show what you can do with talent, imagination and a minimum of money. There should be more movies like this. Take one of these multi-billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or spaceships and spread a little more generosity.
