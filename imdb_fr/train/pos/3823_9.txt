I saw this film in the worst possible circumstances. I had already missed 15 minutes when I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, I thought it might be a movie of the week, but I quickly became fascinated by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman whose kid had been kidnapped. The premise began to take turns that I did not see coming and at the end credits, I was going through the guide in flight to understand what I had just watched. It turns out that I discovered late Do-yeon Jeon, who had won the award for best actress in Cannes for the role. I do not know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema, but I go to the DVD store to find out more.
