An updated version of a story turned into a film in 1938 in England (Return of the Frog) concerning the police pursuit of a great criminal known as a frog because of his frog he gets up (eyes curved, etc.). <br /> <br /> One of the good Wallace movies from the 1960s is a real little entertainment. Clearly influenced by (or influenced) the resumption of Dr. Mabuse's films, The Frog seems to be more of a super villain than a big thief. Although it's not the best of Wallace's movies, it's worth a look. This would make an interesting double film with the excellent previous movie. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
