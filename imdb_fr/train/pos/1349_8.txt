RKO had the reputation of producing unique and familiar American pieces. <br /> <br /> Anne Shirley (in the role of Dawn O'Day) was in the movies since her childhood. In 1933, she was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and "flower girl" in "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembers Anne's work from a previous movie and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaking boat, the pin "stolen", the incident of "red hair". Anne was so right for the role of the talkative and comforting orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, her desire to please and her ardent temperament. O.P. Heggie was great because the understanding between Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley worked well as a Marilla company. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had also been in the movies as a small child was doing well like Diana Barry. Mrs. Haden proved that she could play with someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series, was Mrs. Barry.
