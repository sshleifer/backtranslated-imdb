The zenith of two brilliant quarries. David Lynch, better known for his less accessible materials, composes a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely places. A man travels to see his separated brother. Having no other means of transportation, his trip took him for six weeks with a lawn mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, delivers a surprisingly layered and nuanced performance in the lead role. Extremely beautiful in its exultation of little things, Straight Story is a classic cinematic experience not to be missed. Sissy Spacek is notable as the daughter of Farnsworth, a middle-aged, underaged woman who lives with the loss of her children.
