Note that all those who did not like and appreciate this movie commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand this type of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and storylines, the movies last about 120 minutes. However, the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio and imaginary. I do not care if a movie is as good or in fact resembles the book it is based on. We do not care? I judge him for what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. An old story and often seen, prone to clich√©s, it could easily have been embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves are doing. A critic found Riffen very old. I never knew she was 40 when she made this movie. To her credit as an actress she played incredibly well for a girl aged 23 to 24. I also think it's the best thing Reeves has ever done. The story could have been stronger and I agree that the scenario could have used the "tightening". Nevertheless, it is worth looking at; This is clearly not a powerful love story, but rather a charming love story that will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and that good overcomes evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the mandatory word f # $%, bare buttocks or hours of swinger kisses. <br /> <br /> Finally, the score is excellent.
