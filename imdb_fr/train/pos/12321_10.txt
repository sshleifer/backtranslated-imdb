I saw this film in my childhood. And after 10 years, I could not remember anything of this movie but I discovered it. I do not know how I discovered this movie either. It's my life. My favorite movie of all time. My words will lack true meaning what I have inside for this movie. I am this movie. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, scary and martial arts. The story of the power of love is very touching and warm. It is a masterpiece of Hong Kong cinema. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman is without doubt one of the best ghost stories ever transformed into a movie. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, A Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin, played by Leslie Cheung, is a lucky young man who sets off in search of a monastery to find shelter in the woods, a place where villagers seem to be very afraid to approach. The trek alone is perilous with the wolves and a mad Taoist monk lives in the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple. She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress, but when she meets the innocent Ling Choi Sin, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a kind of fool, but his heart is in the right place, While Tsing tries to protect him from other spirits in the woods, he tries to protect her from the monk who tries to kill the spirits in the woods. There are great martial arts, even a monk who begins to sing drunk when performing ritual forms of Taoist sword. The film makes a lot of old traditional acrobatic martial arts movies, magical and flying in the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long dresses and scarves, but the film really flows and everything is effective. <br /> Tsing must be married to an evil monster, who can not be good, and we feel his lot in his house where we meet his sisters and his mother-in-law who is really not nice. <br /> <br /> Finally, they must fight a witch tree with a deadly tongue and go with Yin to the bottom of hell to fight a millennial evil to save their souls and bring back the ashes of Ling home to be buried as it should be. a chance of reincarnation. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really pays attention to details. We are touched in many ways by this movie, you will laugh, cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. And although in the end, Yin and Ling Choi Sin escape under the morning sun under an enchanting rainbow, we never know if Tsing was able to afford a reincarnation, but we know it.
