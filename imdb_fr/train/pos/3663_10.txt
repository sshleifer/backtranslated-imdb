Perhaps the latest film by Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based) should you like? It's a neorealistic fantasy, a kind of oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage field and raises her as her own son. After a few years, the baby is a boy (named Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying. He goes to an orphanage and, at age 18, he leaves. Immediately, he finds that he does not have a house. Toto is optimistic, however, and will not let him down. A man steals his suitcase and instead of getting angry, Toto becomes his friend and will stay with him in a small slum. Toto takes initiatives and organizes the many homeless people living in the area and builds a better slum. Soon, the owner is trying to sell this piece of land and the slum citizens must protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner formed a police force to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a fantasy in its own right (previously, it was a more comical / fantastic melodrama in the manner of Charlie Chaplin). This kind of thing is so strange and shocking that it is probably better for others to see it for themselves. It's pretty amazing and very funny. You can certainly raise objections about the plot of Miracle in Milan. Fellini and Visconti were sharply criticized when they began to move away from neorealism. I think I read this was widely criticized at the time of its publication. At this point, though, it's so nice - I loved it. This is perhaps my favorite of Vittorio de Sica's movies, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Raiders are very close. 10/10.
