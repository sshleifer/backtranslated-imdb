In 1967, I visited the Elsinore Lake sailing harbor and piloted a yellow Pratt Read glider. Back in Germany, the above series was broadcast on television. One segment involved high-altitude glider flights in California in the early 1950s. (The real pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played it in the series) It turned out that the glider in the movie was the same (same number N) as the one I had flown to Elsinore Lake. Since I've seen this segment, I'm looking for it and I'm wondering if it's available. (The other segments of this grave were Baker's ejectable seat, an instrument for tracking down avalanche victims, and so on.
