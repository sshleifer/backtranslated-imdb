Hayao Miyazaki is second to none when it comes to using a hand drawn animation as a form of narration. Still, he is often compared to Walt Disney. It's so unfair, because it becomes obvious when watching Miyazaki's films that he is the top artist. He really has the gift of thrilling adults and children, and Laputa is indeed a fantastic ride. <br /> <br /> But where can I begin to describe a film so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's work never ceases to amaze me. Laputa is a large-scale adventure and I wonder how a film can be so rich in detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child who dreams of an adventure of such magnitude and magic, what would it look like? The solution would be to sit in a seat and watch Laputa, because it's really a fantasy of childhood come true. Every minute of the film is rich and captivating ... from the train chase to the astonishing sequences of flights ... and the magnificent view of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score of Joe Hisaishi! All you possibly want from an adventure movie is here.
