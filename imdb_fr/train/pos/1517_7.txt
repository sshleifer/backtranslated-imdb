In the spirit of Robert Bloch, famous for "Psycho", four stories of ominous terror appear in this anthology film from Amicus, which, while not as entertaining or frightening as I would have liked, nevertheless offers decent entertainment of gender. . <br /> <br /> This is related to the recapitulative story of a very skeptical Scotland Yard detective (John Bennett) investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor; he told us that this case was related to some other business by the house where they took place and that our film was launched. <br /> <br /> "Method for Murder" by author Charles Hillyer (still ravishing Denholm Elliott) haunted by his latest fictional creation, which apparently came to life. This sequence has some good moments surreal and quite suspensive, and is crowned by a revelation and a quite fun ending. <br /> <br /> The horror icon of "Waxworks" stars Peter Cushing embodies the retired stockbroker Philip Grayson, who, along with his old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) is obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a museum of macabre wax. The dream sequence is the most effective in this episode, although it's always nice to watch Cushing. The final images presented to us in this story are quite shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweets to the Sweet" stars another beloved horror star, Christopher Lee, in the role of John Reid, who does not treat an adorable moppet child Jane (Chloe Franks ) with too much kindness, and it's up to the new girlfriend Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to find out why. The mystery of this episode is perfectly managed. Filmmakers wisely do not bend their hand, so it's a real shock when we get the whole truth about this unhappy family. The "dying" moments are particularly horrible. <br /> <br /> "The Cloak" is the purest comedy of the four; Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors who has played the role of Dr. Who over the years, is very amusing as a vain and capricious horror movie star (in fact, he is the highlight of this story) who, exasperated by the lack in his latest low budget film, goes out and buys his own coat. This cloak has strange powers, which I dare not reveal here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as a companion to Pertwees; A wonderful example of humor here is a catch-up to none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The recapitulative story ends predictably but still effectively as Detective Inspector Holloway learns that he should have taken all the warnings that were given to him more seriously. <br /> <br /> Underlined by Michael Dress's unusual, striking and disturbing score, "The House Flowing With His Blood" is an entertaining mix of stories; Although I do not like it as much as, say, "Tales of the Crypt", it's still fun. Perfectly directed by Peter Duffell, he slowly but surely advances toward each of his disturbing conclusions and is certainly a good film of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
