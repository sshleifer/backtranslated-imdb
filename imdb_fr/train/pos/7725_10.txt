I saw this movie for the first time when it came out. I was about 9 years old. old and found this film both very entertaining and very scary and unlike any other movie I had seen until then. <br /> <br /> BASIC INITIATION: An expedition is sent from the Earth to Altair's fourth planet, a large main sequence star in the Aquilae constellation to find out what happened to a colony of settlers landed twenty years earlier and which we had never heard of since. <br /> <br /> THEME: An inferior civilization (ours) comes into contact with the remnants of a very advanced extraterrestrial civilization, the Krell-200 000 years removed. The "seed" of destruction of one civilization is transmitted to another, without his knowledge. The theme of this film is very good evil against evil. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time with my brother when he was originally released. I was only a boy and the tiger scenes really scared me, just like the battle scenes with the invisible force of the creature. I was also amazed at how much the film looked like reality. <br /> <br /> What really catches my attention as an adult is the truth of the film about "forbidden knowledge" and the relevance of what we will do when we do it. (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (extraterrestrial) civilization much more developed than we are now. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work ourselves to gain the knowledge and wisdom of how to use advanced technologies. This is, in my opinion, the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned at the doctorate that "to know is power", it is at best, in fact, a mistake! Knowledge is a "potential" power depending on how it is applied (... if it is applied at all.) [It's not what you know, but how you use what you know!] br>> <br /> The impact of this film could well materialize in the future of humanity. It is knowledge in itself that is not enough, we must, we must have the wisdom on which it depends to control our own destiny, otherwise we will find ourselves like the Krell in the film, just close your eyes. <br /> <Many thanks to those who responded to previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very appreciated !! I hope this story will entertain you as much as I have in the past 40 years .... <br /> <br /> Note: 10 of 10 stars
