The cast is different and now they have taken a different approach, we have the street team "Networth" vs. the supposedly professional team "Magna" but if you think the smart street team would have a hard time getting you right. Even though the Magna team sometimes struggled, the street team simply disintegrated week after week. <br /> <br /> First, some things to reiterate regarding "Apprentice 3" continue in the same absurd Trump mentality) and play in this series: if you are a good project manager but you lose, the team will attack you and you will be fired, while your teammates are often the ones doing the job. Quite simply absurd, this game show that claims to hire the best candidate "eliminates" the best while dysfunctional candidates stab themselves until only one candidate remains and the latter is the best. lol <br /> <br /> This season, all players have witnessed insulting and abusive gay stereotypes as teams attempt to run campaigns. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far Cast Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, these three are the only people who, in my opinion, were unjustly dismissed by Trump, the others really brought in because they only incited conflict, anger, and pain. It's just amazing, as one candidate, Audrey Evans, said that her girlfriend was fired and some of her worthless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's the game, it's "The Apprentice". where manipulation, stabbing and the popular mentality of "everyone fighting against the project leader" are still popular. <br /> <br /> This has been a fun adventure, however, candidates are awarded a wide range of assignments, ranging from photo shoots to building mini golf courses, to building new apartments. <br /> <br /> Even if it's still the apprentice, you just have to laugh all the time, because madness and chaos creep in until the lucky person is the winner.
