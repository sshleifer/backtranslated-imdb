One of the biggest movie I saw this year. Last perhaps before sunrise, which we see also late at night, alone in the laboratory. I like the idea of ​​the film, which suggests the free will of man and our weakness against destiny. With the time spent James and Kathryn are doomed to failure and an indescribable pain comes. I like the end. but a big question comes too. The virus should not be released again, should it? <br /> <br /> In the last scene of the airport. Jose is referred to the meeting of James by future scientists. When he told her that the scientists had already received her message and knew that someone else would spread the virus. And together they meet Kathryn when Kathryn tells James that the real man is DR. Assistant of Goines. So, it is clear that Jose also has the real information about the virus (James watches him at that moment, do you remember?) And he has teeth. So why has everything happened yet ?? Why do future scientists do nothing after the truth is revealed ?? My biggest question after the movie ...
