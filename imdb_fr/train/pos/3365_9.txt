A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> From time to time, you come across a film that really touches the nerves. This one offers a very simple premise, almost flawless in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It is surprising that Etore Scola's "Una giornate particulare" is relatively unreported, even disliked by some critics. Time Out calls it "garbage" and Leonard Maltin, a little softer, "nice but insignificant". I do not agree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but in his simple story he shows us more information about everyday life in Fascist Italy than most of the films I saw . The cinematography is clearly imperfect, even a little bland, and the scenario is simple, which could explain the relative unpopularity of the film. Considering that the great Italian films did not spoil the public at the end of the 70s, it is even stranger that it did not really catch the attention of the critics. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a 10-minute archive collage of Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. In this context, we meet for the first time Antonietta (Loren), a woman of solitary and torn hearth of love with six children in a Roman building. One day, as her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be one of the few not to attend the ceremonies. He is well educated, cultivated and soon she is attracted to him. Throughout the film, we hear the fascist rally of the janitor's radio screaming in the yard. Scola uses the camera in a fun way to integrate us in the procedure. After the opening scene, the camera crosses the courtyard of the modernist apartment building (hypermodern at the time), apparently in search of our main characters that we have not met yet. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two main roles, all the more surprising because they are totally counter-typed. Canada's John Vernon plays Loren's husband, but he is on the screen only in the first and last scene. I think his voice had to be doubled because he is not of Italian ancestry and has never lived there, to my knowledge, so I can not imagine he speaks Italian. If his voice was doubled, I did not notice it at all. On the contrary, he is completely credible as an Italian, even more so than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are exceptional, the end is perfect and the framing is not as pretentious as complete, but works perfectly. Do not miss this one. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
