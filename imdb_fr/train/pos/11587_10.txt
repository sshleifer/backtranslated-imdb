I love this movie and I really wish I had it one day. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, I loved it and would like to see it again! I do not remember much, but I think that a Native American boy lives in a pretty village with his family, and I do not remember what's going on, but he's supposed to go out alone in the desert. His sister brings him food and he leaves. While outside, other Indian boys escape and put feathers on him. He turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you see an eagle wearing a Turquoise collar, it's the boy. I have always been fascinated by legends, especially Native American legends, and I would like this DVD to be released someday. PLEASE RELEASE IT, whoever is concerned!
