I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat this sentence and remember how it is a show. I am a big fan of science fiction and this show has the reasons to be the most important science show (fiction?) From the history of film / television. There are so many theories in this show about the universe that I could found a religion. It's amazing, season after season, the show continues to improve. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 years old (19 years old) and I find it so ironic that my two favorite television shows of all time Richard Dean Anderson. It's also interesting to see how each character is practically the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> When I first saw Stargate, I immediately appreciated it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi movies. The television show was going to turn. I was really excited, but I was not introduced until the fifth season. <br /> <br /> Although I'm disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a film trilogy, the studio opted for the series instead. <br /> <br /> I would say, however, that it went well. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is amazing and I hope it will never die. Atlantis here we are!
