I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is rather widespread ... the federal government has planned to install a tracking device in the jaw of a small thief to attract a more dangerous thief / hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man to whom the authorities have "proposed" to be implanted the device, is a very nice person and it is very fun to be in his head for a while. Alvin is proving to be much more than a good-natured but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not as easy to manipulate as he looks. It's really worth a look.
