Love Trap is not a short film, it is obviously a feature film with a duration of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> As I write this story, I might as well talk a little bit more about Love Trap. I'm often asked what differentiates Love Trap ... Here's how I answer this question: 1) It features characters - one in particular - who have never been seen before in a movie, period. <br /> <br /> 2) It reveals more truth about love and deepens the very concept of love that no other American film has ever been made, IMHO. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as on the way the story is told, it does not look like any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It offers an extremely timely insight into various cultural issues, both inside and outside the black community. <br /> <Over time, we will come to see Love Trap as a work as original as possible at this time, deliciously refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare piece in terms of morality, full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information on this film.
