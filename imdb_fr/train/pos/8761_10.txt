I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale is incredibly immature in her role. The film is only flawed because it seems that the two defendants seem to be in a monastery, working as monks in the grass and subject to strict discipline close to the martial arts. The acting, the filmography and the astonishing colors of what is supposed to be Thailand catch the eye, but Claire Daines steals the whole film and is of an unexpected depth in her learning of the hard lesson of life up to in the end, in unprecedented and totally unexpected unselfishness act in the real world. The flaws are minimal and I recommend the film, which seems buried forever for rare TV shows. For my part, I want the film for my collection - a collection of only 10 rated movies. Look, you will be very touched.
