This one is hard to watch - as a previous reviewer says. It's incredible considering the terrible movies that came out just after the Second World War, especially the "liberation" of Dachau. It is clear that from the middle of the war we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows a "transport" is striking, almost as if it was based on a real news movie (the Nazis liked to record their atrocities). Knox like the Nazi is brilliant. He traces the course of a Nazi career. This mapping is particularly revealing when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans, first mocking Hitler, then incredulous and ultimately defenseless. This contrast, however, allows us to believe in the "conversion" of a young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi position. This happened, as evidenced by numerous attempts against Hitler, including the Staffenberg plot that took place at the time of the film's release. A powerful film, effectively using flashbacks, accurately predicting the traces of Nuremberg and others that would occur once the war ended.
