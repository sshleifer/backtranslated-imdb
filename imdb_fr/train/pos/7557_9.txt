Gender Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turns out it's both. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in the clay <br /> <br /> Then they all left <br /> <In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great episode of season 1. I like this one because the story is the kind where you're never really sure what's going to happen then. It's totally original. The teaser is very fun with the close-up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. I really need to learn this thumb trick that the genrebender does. I really like the atmosphere in the small village of Kindred and Mulder and Scully who sneak in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. It's one of my favorite episodes of season 1. I think what I like about it is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and crop circles on the left. Many people see this as an extraterrestrial episode related to mythology, like "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think it could easily be seen as a mythology. Maybe the sexuality looked like the alien bounty hunter and could seem like anyone. Huh? Anyway, I give the episode a 9 out of 10.
