Musically, Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another more than perfect musical after Top Hat, if that was possible. Although in this case, as in the case of Jerome Kern, Roberta told Follow the Fleet, Randolph Scott was retained by another singer, Harriet Hilliard. ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget Ginger Rogers, his former partner. But now, both are on leave. Fred and Ginger sit at the place where they stopped and Randy accidentally meets Ginger's frumpy sister, Harriet, who blossoms into real beauty. But Randy is a typical lover and let them sail. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving Berlin has written a score full of hits that tightly supervises production. Ginger makes some really remarkable vocalizations with Let Yourself, with whom she and Fred dance later. But the real success of the series is Let's Face the Music and Dance, a number played during a Navy show. Sung first by Astaire and danced by the couple, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the greatest romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dance on this one is an absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who they are. But they'll know right away when I mention it with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson. That's right Ozzie and Harriet. I do not understand why Harriet stopped singing when she had just become David and Ricky's mother on TV. Again, she did not even keep her own name. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on TV. Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really wear a melody. She sings Get me behind me Satan and the moon and I'm here, but where are you, both full of feeling and class. I recommend you to see Follow the Fleet if for no other reason than to hear an incredibly forgotten Harriet Hilliard dimension today.
