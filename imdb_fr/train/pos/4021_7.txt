A complex story posed on the background of Bharat's score. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl and an educated Hindu who burns a Muslim man's crop - but eventually you end up loving them both. The story is powerful, but the scenario and the unfolding are hesitant. Partition of background music and songs are outstanding. Then comes the memorable role of veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography captures very well the weather, violence and flavors of rural Punjab. Other actors have either acted badly or have not had the opportunity to act. Management is really the weakest link. The characters were not well developed. Not crisp, unlike "the Earth", where even a 5-line character leaves a mark. The end is very interesting. This story could have many different purposes - and all could have been equally good.
