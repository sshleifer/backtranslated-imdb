Despite a beautiful and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of the least inspiring Disney films I've seen, and I do not often slap Disney movies. Spirit is a wild stallion who is regularly captured, whether by the cavalry or the Indians, who both try to "break" him. The mind ends up creating a link with the Indian, and that's in a word the story. With the exception of the beautiful animation of the horses, neither me nor my five years were very inspired or excited by this film. It's ironic that this is called "Spirit", as spirit what this movie could have used a little more. An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was nice, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this film is rated G, you will probably end up explaining what "breaking a horse" means for your five-year-old. I did it. <br /> <br />
