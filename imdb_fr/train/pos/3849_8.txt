This last Verhooven film in Dutch made me laugh. As a film buff in search of small details and cross-references, etc. in any film, I can assure anyone interested in cinematographic art that this piece amuses all the senses. I have not read Gerard Reves' book, on which the film is based, but I still believe that we get a frank image of a pretentious poet / writer who takes his picture (in a certain way - without spoiling right here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters with ambiguous intentions, as he did. All this in a superbly packaged cinematography, Paul Verhopven manages to transform the Dutch scene "gesellich (?)" By the way rather cute into an impressive black film, impressive work!
