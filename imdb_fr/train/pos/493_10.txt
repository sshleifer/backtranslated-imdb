I've been a fan of Star Trek for as long as I can remember. When they announced the planning and the premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of Enterprise was well worth the wait. It was well done with the perfect scenery and the acting work done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula was simply superior to Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a remarkable performance as a sub-commander T'Pol. Only two people of this wonderful new crew will take us boldly into the great story of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise should be a good series to watch, and I recommend that. Look at this.
