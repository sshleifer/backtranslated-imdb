I met this film at the local video store during the annual sidewalk sale. While browsing thousands of videos in the hope of finding some cartoons for sale, I came across this film. I read the back of the film and I knew it was the hand of God at work for me to buy this film. You see, I have a group of brothers and sisters of three adopted (and soon adopted) children living with my family. Immediately, my foster children formed a bond with the three children of the film. The film helped them to better understand their own circumstances. Also for the first time, the eldest sibling (7 years old / female) decided to tell me a bit about her past and the traumas she had suffered. She fought against the whole question of trust. It was also the first time I saw her crying. After watching the film, I asked him what it meant for a child to be adopted. She replied, "It means being happy." A must for families adopting children and considering adoption. This has certainly opened the lines of communication with us.
