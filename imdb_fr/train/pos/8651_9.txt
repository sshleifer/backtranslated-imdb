Kalifornia was released in 1993, when 3 of the 4 main characters lived up to the glory they had in 2006. This is a beautiful psychological thriller that should please all fans of David Duchovny because of his dry skin and smart. stories that end up in his work, as in most of his episodes of X-Files, Playing God, and Red Shoe Diaries. <br /> <br /> People who have been shocked by Brad Pitt's strong southern accent and Juliet Lewis's characters have obviously never spent much time in the south. For each "Brian and Carrie" in the south, there is an "Adele and Early" and in 2006 is the real horror of this movie. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I think the film was written with a cult movie intent - as with Carrie's photography, it's not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of it in your personal library, I think it says a lot about your taste for weird movies.
