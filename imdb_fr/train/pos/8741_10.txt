"The life of an insect" is like a favorite treat. It's full of small pieces that add to something really tasty. <br /> <br /> The story could not have been better; he is intelligent, has "heart" (emotion) and each character has a beautiful "bow" (a growth or a change). In comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" to have a "bow" are Buzz, who is learning to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment towards Buzz. There are tons of laughs and cute moments in "A Bug's Life". The voices of all the actors are excellent and the animation, both in terms of movement and details, is superb. <br /> <br /> This great movie lover does not throw all around "10", but this film deserves the "10" I gave it.
