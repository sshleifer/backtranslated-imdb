Do you remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy who was host on Terrytoons, then on Paramount Cartoon Studios, after that he was a director on Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, it's Coonskin. And it's actually pretty good. Racist, but good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights (No, it was a title that works.) But with a turn that turns into a lampoon of a Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /> <br /> This is Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and end up in a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Randy involuntarily listens to Pappy (Scatman Crothers), his escapee, as he begins to tell Randy a story about "three guys I knew, just like you and your friends." The story of Pappy is told in an animation featuring background images and images in real time. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (voice of White) and Preacher Fox (voice of Gordone) decide to pack and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their house and sells it to a man who turns her into a brothel. Arriving in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear and Fox realize that this is not all that is claimed. They meet a scammer named Simple Savior, a bogus revolutionary leader who claims to be the "cousin" of Black Jesus and gives his followers "the strength to kill whites". In a scenic performance in his "church", Savior avoids being brutalized by symbols of black oppression - represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for "donations". <br /> Rabbit faces for the first time Madigan, a racist and homophobic white policeman and the man at the Mafia barracks, who testifies to his scorn for African Americans, particularly his refusal to swim before meeting thinks they are not worth it). When Madigan discovers that Rabbit has paid for his winnings, he is taken to a discotheque called "The Cottontail" with his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby. <br /> <br /> A black stripper distracts him as a cube of LSD sugar falls into his glass. Madigan, while under the influence of his alcoholic beverage, is then transformed into a sexual affair with a stereotypical and effeminate homosexual man, then pushed into clothes that represented women of the racist archetype, adorned with something racist and finally expelled from the back. of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /> <br /> Then, as he was recovering from his delirium of being drugged, he fires his weapon at random and is shot by the police after firing <br /> <br /> The rabbit, the bear, the fox and the opposing boxer rush out of the boxing arena as they explode. The story ends with the escape of Randy and Pappy as they are shot by several white police, but manage to escape alive. <br /> <br /> This film was controversial at the time of its release. several editions of the director under the title, Street Fight, which is obvious, since Street Fight is a 2005 documentary on racism in the streets. In fact, this film has the same subject as the documentary. <br /> <br /> This caused the closure of Bryanston Pictures, the distributor of this film and the classic classic Tobe Hopper, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but because of racism, Bryanston took over Bakshi's production. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, the show was worth it. The entertainment was great at that time, the plot makes sense and is actually fun too. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERSION: 9/10
