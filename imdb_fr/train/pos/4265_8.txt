If you have not seen this little dark charmer, you should look for him. This is the story of Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray), a man in the middle of the war who is classified 4-F every time he tries to join a branch of the army. He finds a magic lamp that of course contains a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genie is even more rowdy than MacMurray, sending him through time to serve in all the bad times and places that he wants. He is cute, happy and pure, and you can not help but love him. The scenario is very much like a Disney movie, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) both made many Disney movies in the 50s and 60s, but not together. Needless to say, everything ends well for everyone and the viewer goes pretty well.
