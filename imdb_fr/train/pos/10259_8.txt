Many people play unfairly on this series, but many of the videos of the guinea pig are quite funny. Devil's Experiment, in particular, produces truly fantastic effects - not only the infamous eyeball scene, but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a broken hand with a hammer are very realistic - especially for the vintage and the small budget of the video. <br /> <br /> Let me start from the beginning for those who do not know it: this film is an "extreme" film about torture and fake snuff that surfaced in Japan in the midst of The plot in the state is simple: a girl is held by some men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where is its breaking point. This involves brutal violence - all the truly realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful application of the hot oil on the captive girl's arm and the placement of maggots in the subsequent squamous wound . <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men slam the girl in turn while her head falls and a second sequence where the three men kick the girl. and pushing it to the ground. These two scenes are obviously staged and undermine the realism of the rest of the procedure. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of "the experience" is convincing enough to have back pain and takes a lot of abuse and rude stuff in front of the camera. Her reactions, because she has the headphones attached to her head and the loud noises that are played for hours are scary. Among the other abuses she suffers, she is suspended in a tree net during the only times she is put to rest. There's also a disturbing scene where the kidnappers chuckle through her guts and another disgusting and shady scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she vomits. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this show, I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give that episode a shot. 8.5 / 10 for the devil experience.
