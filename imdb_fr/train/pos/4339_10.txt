It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am very touched by the theme that the film intends to convey. One phrase that constantly comes to my mind is that "history repeats itself". Life is what is shown in the film: when people are young, they seem not to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have every excuse for not sharing the most expensive time with their children before too late; people must always work hard to provide for the whole family, but may neglect the subtle feeling of their partners; people always change their points of view at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their hearts are full of love for their beloved; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people share in this world, and it's never too late to talk with people about how they feel in their hearts so they can understand each other better. To finish one day, people should not feel sorry or regret because they have kept their words and there is always hope - a new life. Actors and actresses are fantastic. They perfectly understood the intention of the director. The charm of the film lies, in my opinion, in the effect of bringing to the audience a clever and splendid fusion of cries of joy and tears.
