Last year, the South By Southwest Film Festival (SXSW) in Austin was a huge success. The film is composed of an excellent cast directed by Gloria Reuben, of E.R., and John Glover, who tears the landscape. Although shot on a budget in New York, the film is fabulous and takes us behind the scenes of the rehearsal and editing of what the actors call "The Scottish Play", in reference to the word "Macbeth". thought to bear on the old curse of the room. The theater company presents all the emotions of the play, the desire, the jealousy, the rage, the suspicion and a little pleasure. Games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced (in the main role) by a well-known "pretty face" of the televised soap opera scene in order to attract larger crowds. The green-eyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds well. Soundtrack, and good performance all around. The DVD includes the director's comments and some deleted scenes.
