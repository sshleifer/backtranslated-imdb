This 370-minute film was broadcast by Italian public television in the early seventies. He tells you the myth attributed to Homer of Voyage to Odysseus after the Trojan War. It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, told 500 years after these events, around 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is a movie dating from 1969, so if you buy would find that the sound is just mono and there is no language other than Italian, even the legend is in Italian. Pity. Many people would like this masterpiece if it had at least the list of English subtitles. But if you do not mind, I highly recommend watching this movie.
