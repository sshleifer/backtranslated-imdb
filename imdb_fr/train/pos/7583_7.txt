The final chapter of the Hanzo the Razor trilogy offers a fitting conclusion to this entertaining series of samurai exploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) as director, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps thanks to producer Shintaro Katsu, with the exception of the titular antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo discovers a female ghost who keeps a hidden treasure at the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he is not afraid of being a ghost. So he proceeds to rape ... uh, interrogate her using the now well-known rotating network device. The plot goes through a series of blind monks who also serve as lenders, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's senior officer, Onishi, and his two employees provide the typical comic notes and, as a general rule, the activities go on as usual. <br /> <br /> Nally much less complicated and easier to follow than the first one (which is everywhere and a little mess), less elegant, dramatic and bloody than the second one (undoubtedly the best of the Hanzo series), but still fun and worthy of the name. Complete with trademark training sequences, mandatory rape, sword fighting and a mystery that Hanzo is called upon to investigate, it will eventually satisfy the fans.
