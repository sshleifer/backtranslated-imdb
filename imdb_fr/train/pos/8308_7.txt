A musical Sunday is appropriate to make your heart flutter, and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could sing the drawers of the ladies and set the rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Speak to Leon for a definitive description, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> It was a fascinating biopic when we saw Little Richard struggling with his father, with his church and with himself about who he was. He won the battle and no one else has his voice or his style.
