Born in Berlin in 1942, Margarethe von Trotta was an actress. She is now a director and a very important writer. She has been portrayed, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensitivity to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. "Rosenstrasse", which garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most aggressive reviews I've ever read in this article) is not a perfect film. This is a good film that testifies to the rare successful opposition against the genocidal Nazi regime on the part of all peoples, generally powerless Germans who demonstrate in a street in Berlin. <br /> <br /> The co-writer von Trotta uses the Real Incident Rosenstrasse in the context of the search for information by a young woman about the life of his mother in the German capital during the Second World War. She never revealed her son's life. <br /> <br /> Ruth Weinstein's husband (Jutta Lampe) has passed away. and in a surprising return to an apparently unresolved orthodox Jewish lifestyle, Ruth not only "sits at shivah" (the week-long mourning ritual), but she is keen to follow the strict prohibitions of her faith. His apartment in New York is testimony to the wealth of work of his deceased wife. Hannah (Maria Schrader), her daughter, born in the United States, and her brother are a little shocked by the hypothesis of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices imposed by their mother, but they participate. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis may well break out when Ruth warns that she will disavow Hannah if she does not abandon her beautiful, handsome Luis. Stay tuned. <br /> <br /> A cousin comes to pay homage to him, but also leaves clues to an interested Hannah about a war mystery relating to the childhood of her mother in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she questions her mother who resolutely refuses to talk about this part of her life. It's very very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, in general but in part, fled the Holocaust. So those days were just not discussed. <br /> <br /> Hannah, having learned that a Gentile German had saved Ruth's life, fled to Berlin in the hope of finding the savior who still breathes. If it were not the case, it would have been a very short film. But, claiming to be a historian, Ruth finds Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), 90, a widow. While Lena tells her story, shattered by repressed memories, the scenes take place smoothly between Berlin and the capital of the time. <br /> <br /> The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was an excellent pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime, he was forced to use "Israel" as his first name, just as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names (by the way, I wish IMDb did not give the name of Fabian on his list of characters with the fake "Israel" included - he simply perpetuates a name used by the Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation). <br /> <br /> While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, people married to "Aryans" were exempted. For a while. Until 1943, when the regime decided to take them too (most were men, a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity. <br /> <br /> Young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she knows, as well as many other women, is that they are confined to a building in Rosenstrasse. The crowd of worried women is being formed, some pitifully seeking out German officers who, as might be expected, refuse to help and verbally abuse them ("Jew-loving whore" being one of the names). As a sub-parcel, Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth, who was hiding when her mother was seized (remember, Ruth is now sitting at Shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is captivatingly portrayed by Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the more and more angry protests, women finally win. Men and a handful of women are released. As in real history, the Nazis gave in, one of the few, almost unprecedented, when fools recognized defeat in their homicidal program (another was the end of the euthanasia campaign aimed at ridding the Reich of the defectives mental and chronic invalids, but that's another story). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta reinforces the tension and the story of each woman is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to shake up old Lena who, little by little, begins to suspect that she is not dealing with an ordinary historian, but rather with someone who needs to get to know the girl she has saved. child whose mother was murdered. <br /> <br /> The contrasts between the Rosenstrasse of 1943, a whole, and today's busy, reconstructed and unified street in Berlin, are a recurrent theme. Today's Berlin carries the legacy but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta says it very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband, though strong, is also shown to be totally helpless in the trap of detention with a prospect of probable expulsion (which is clearly understood by all the characters - including the local police and army - as a one-way trip into oblivion). . Old Ruth is forced, in a catalytic way, to face the demons long repressed in her happy life in New York. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers the need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although Times criticism does not seem to know it). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hand is safe but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a party with Lena's violin sound is useless and distracting. The suggestion that she could have gone to bed with the minister of propaganda, the most fanatical Hitlerite faithful of high caliber, to save her husband undermines the marvelous accomplishment of the wives and parents who were demonstrating. Most of the German officers are from the central cast and are shaped by Erich von Stroheim's "copy / paste" school, a school of Teutonic malice. But that's understandable. <br /> <br /> The history of Rosenstrasse has been the subject of books and articles and some argue that this is a case paradigm, according to which many more Jews could have been saved if more Germans had protested. Unfortunately, this argument is absurd. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and naturally very interested. Most Germans were on a dividing line between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. This is why the Rosenstrasse event was practically unique. Whether one buys or rejects Goldenhagen's thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices to murderers, one can not deny that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism has turned into a virulent strain from 1933. <br /> <br /> Elderly Lena remarks that what women did was "a ray of light" in bad weather. Most men and women on a near-death journey survived the war. So, "a ray of light" was and von Trotta's film is a beacon of enlightenment showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and that for every life saved, an opportunity to celebrate exists . And always. <br /> <br /> 9/10
