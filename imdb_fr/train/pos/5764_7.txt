Originally, I had reviewed this movie on Amazon about six or seven years ago and I did the operation. I think I called it "miserable" and a "turkey". Ok, well, by most standards, it's still a turkey. It has almost no production value, the little land there is almost meaningless, and the game of actors is at the level of a game of third year. That said, over the years, this has really gained momentum as a camp classic. In fact, every film by director Todd Sheets has had this effect. In this respect, they are almost like Ed Wood: watch them again and again and spot fuzzy lines, continuity errors (even zombie, two different places!) And other flaws. <br /> <br /> Let me say this: Sheets is a very nice guy and, even though this is one of his first productions, it's not so great, he's improved. And I must add that the only really decent actor / actress in the film is Kasey Rousch, although I am biased because I went to school with her.
