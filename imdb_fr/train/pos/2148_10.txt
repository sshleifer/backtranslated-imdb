I'm always looking forward to seeing this movie when it's on TV. I must have the DVD, I guess. The range of different types of people is great. It tells me that anyone can be a dancer if he makes enough effort. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so weird but full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with a wonderful dance. Unfortunately, we never have the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would do for the perfect sequel if they had. But I guess that leaves to your imagination everything that could happen. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I did not see the Hollywood remake. I do not know if I want. I do not really like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere is more like the original than Lopez. I feel that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
