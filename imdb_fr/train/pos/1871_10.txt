I was adopted at birth and I certainly did not have Antwone Fisher's problems in the film, but I still share some of the emotions and this film really helped me to bring them out and force me to manage them. I even realized that I had a "missing piece" and that I will now look for my biological parents. <br /> <br /> I cried almost a day after seeing this for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with her birth mother, juxtaposed with the reaction of her father's family to her sudden onset, is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our biological parents. And his self-confidence and his assertions about his mother and the aggressors of his past were so powerful. I could really relate to that and my need to tell people, "Yeah, my parents put me aside when I was born, but another group of parents came to pick me up and love me. , I succeed!" > <br /> It also helped my wife understand us, our adopted children, who had tragic experiences before coming to our home. And it helped me realize how disruptive our social system is. If you remember reading last year the story of the foster child in Florida who had been "lost" AND the story of "Miranda & Ashley" in Oregon City where SCF ignored many complaints of sexual violence in About the man who finally killed them AND the week of the film was released, yet another story in New Jersey of three children who were ignored by the system. One is dead. The state apparently thought that the house they were in was ok because the guardian was employed (as a stripper) and used "only occasionally" heroin! <br /> <br /> This film contains so many problems - and they are so well treated by the screenplay and acting that Antwerp Fisher should be a "Best Film" candidate for sure. It does not matter whether you're adopted or not, it's a puzzle that can not be ignored by anyone who is concerned about children in our society.
