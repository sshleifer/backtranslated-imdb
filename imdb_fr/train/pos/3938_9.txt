Henry Fonda captures brilliantly what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was. He's a fool. Thanks to Fonda's performance, we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a crazy country. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the judicial proceedings, you can see that under the outdoor posters is a brilliant man who masters very well what is going on around him and how to influence the people who l surround. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good understanding of how to present humor. This is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes, his timing is perfect. There is a sequence in the trial that made me laugh hard enough. It shows again this gift in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The end of John Ford is absolutely brilliant, Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and far away a huge symbolic storm of war Secession. . He advances in the story. The film is a fiction but Lincoln's vision is extraordinary. Well worth a visit.
