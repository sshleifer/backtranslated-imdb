This show is quite to see. He has the best talent casting I've seen in a long time. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I guess ABC executives are not used too, because it was not another reality show). However, this show was credible with nice characters and wonderful stories. I'm probably not in the age group they expect to like the show, as I'm in my forties, but many of my friends also liked it (late 30's - mid 40's) and are dying to produce quality shows with talented cast members. I do not think this show has had enough time to win an audience. I think if we had more time, this show would have worked very well. Again, ABC gives no chance to a show with real potential. With so many shows given luck after luck and not worth it! They must give the quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and win an audience. I really liked the characters and was eager to watch every episode. I watched the episodes on ABC videos and the series continues to improve. Although I think they still owe us an episode (number 13?). We want to watch what we can! Bomb ABC with e-mails and letters and see if it's possible to save this show from extinction. It certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are worth saving and this show is certainly one of them. SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION AT ABC AT: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
