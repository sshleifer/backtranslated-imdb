Greta Garbo's American cinema debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept away by fate and our actions, like in a torrent, causing us to lose part of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant woman in love with Ricardo Cortez, Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by her domineering mother. Leonora ends up homeless and goes to Paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation of being a cowardly woman. In reality, his attitude is partly due to bitterness in the face of Rafael's abandonment. <br /> <br /> She goes home to visit her family and finally faces Rafael. Surprisingly, no one knows that she is the famous La Brunna and Garbo plays her diva role as she truly was and she is rewarded with such proud freshness in her subsequent performances. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez recalls a lot of Valentino apparently in this part, and he was prepared to be a clone of Valentino by MGM, although he never thought he could be in the reality and he was right. He is credible in an unpleasant role as a mum boy with a weak will and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the film. He fails to win Leonora when she returns home and later, when he follows her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This film is superbly shot, with brilliant sequences of storms and the sets illustrating Spain at the time are authentic. looking. There are also some great side performances from former players Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. <br /> <br /> Although it's a story of lost love and missed opportunities, I do not think Leonora and Rafael would have been happy together, because he needed a more traditional wife and that she was a career woman, and I do not think she would have been happy in a small village. The end is true and not unanimous. <br /> <br /> See this one as Garbo's first American film and a precursor of upcoming events
