How could I miss the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not, so I rented this clutter of a movie. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I discovered about this young man's legend. I was also surprised by the mediocrity of this film. Maybe it was very, very late and at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon, or maybe because it was really slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it's slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I allow myself to recommend this place not to be missed, it is a beautiful history of Australian history (given the youth of the country, it is very rare and it is appropriate to appreciate it) and the film contains good sequences of actions. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see it for its historical value .... (yes, that's right ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
