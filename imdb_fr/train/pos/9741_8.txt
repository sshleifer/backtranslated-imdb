I was pleasantly surprised to find that How to lose friends and alienate people was far from being a comedy as disgusting as what the trailer had brought me. I quickly absorbed myself in the unfolding of the story and I remained absorbed. The stimulation of the more visual humorous content was, I thought, on the spot. (I mean, I felt like Pegg's attempts to restore lost control a lot "in real time", so to speak.) At other times, it was time to share the thought of its main protagonists how events affected them and what led them to where they were now. All the characters were well melted, to a certain extent interesting in themselves and generally very friendly. (Any seemingly ruthless ambition displayed tended to be tempered by a corresponding resilience.) An entertaining, cleverly scripted, brilliantly directed and superbly played movie that I would highly recommend.
