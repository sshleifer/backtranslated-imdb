I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the movie) felt the need to use so many blasphemies for no reason. Maybe it's his idea of ​​"adult" movies, lots of nasty words with bathroom humor? I thought better of him and I thought less about him for this film. <br /> <br /> Falk acting and a few moments of humor and perhaps some important themes have made me give it such a high score. <Br /> <br /> This could be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh at their own people and their weaknesses. But the lack of consideration for the families of the public seriously harms what could have been a family film but fails. Certainly not worth spending money, although it may be worth a free watch on TV.
