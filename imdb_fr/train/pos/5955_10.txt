As creator of "This Darkness", I admit that we have neglected 3 very important thanks in our final credits. Omissions were a control that could not be corrected once committed, nor did the parties involved - who saw the film - talk about it at the time. On behalf of the excellent actors and the film crew, I apologize to them. Obviously, some critics posted here are stern given the fact that their credit is accidental. Our production values ​​were negligible and our "special effects" were quite special, but the plot is very strong and the cinematography of John McLeod is superb. We hope that you, the readers, will enjoy "This Darkness" and the efforts of those who have devoted themselves for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
