I saw this film for the first time at the cinema at the age of 8 and it always makes me crack. The Muppets are so cool and they approach the world of the show with a refreshing naivety. My favorite scene is where the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit in a fancy restaurant. It's a smart and fun movie for kids and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
