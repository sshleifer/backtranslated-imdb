Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who finds a boy in a box in front of his apartment. She decides to have him come and repair his cuts. She then gives him a note to eat the food she has prepared and then goes home because she has to go to work. When she comes home, she finds that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live with her like a brother or a cousin. Desperate to send him away, she told him that if he became his pet, he could stay. And as a pet, she says he would have no right and would do anything she told him. (Not in this perverse way!) To his surprise, he accepts and from that moment he is known as Momo, his pet.
