Jackie Chan is considered by many moviegoers and martial artists to be one of the biggest stars of the action to have been awarded the big screen and Police Story has consolidated his reputation as a likely successor to the great and late Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon revealed the so-called mark of Lee's greatness in the 70s, so do Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Forget the trilogy of Rush Hour, or any of his efforts in the United States - the film that truly characterizes Chan's excellence, not to mention the kick-off of his kung fu talisman status kicking and breaking bones, as well as that from his film career was this, Police Story - the first in a series of successful cop movies, taking place on the mainland, today in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of his efforts - along with the American Rush Hour, The Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo in the name - and frankly many of them pale in insignificance compared to Police Story. In these films, we saw a less muted version of Jackie, for which she did not have the opportunity to use her combat abilities to the fullest, not to mention that the combat sequences were not as good. only those in which such efforts as Drunken Master, police history to name. <br /> <br /> The cascades of this film are extraordinary and are best described in all action movies. The shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and we have to believe it: flying shards of glass, Chan, who hangs in front of the bus only by his cane while a madman is frantically dragging through the streets of the city, and Chan has successfully used all kinds of inanimate objects and propulsion devices as weapons to fight the wicked. <br /> <br /> Considering he is known to have injured and broken all the bones of his body and put himself in danger, Jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself in not not relying on it, bears witness to his reputation as an expert in kung fu. Especially since he has the blues to show. Thus, he proved that he was not a pony in his turn when it came to designing and proposing varied and intelligent movements. <br /> <br /> At the level of history, there is not much to discuss but what it lacks of narrative, it composes with its sequences of action and fight from end to end. As for the dialogue, it's not a really huge aspect of the film. That's why most Jackie fans and martial arts movies are more interested in action than in story. <br /> <br /> Matrix, there is no son or CGI, nor any form of computer deception involved. What you see is what you get and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic, full of action and thrilling stunts. It's a lot better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all his other American efforts. <Br/> <br /> Police Story is an excellent movie that I would definitely recommend to any novice Jackie Chan fan, but do not know which one to watch first.
