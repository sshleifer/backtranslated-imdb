He was a favorite of my childhood - I remember seeing him on TV and being pleased to see him every time. Now that I have grown up and have a child of mine, I wanted to introduce him to this classic film. We watched it last Friday and he loved it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand approached and took hold of mine - he was really scared. "Will he beat the spider, Poppa?" Look, you'll see. It does not have a historical reference frame (eight years), so Baghdad, under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid, could as well be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he especially enjoyed the heroics and the maneuvers were perpetrated by the boy thief and not by the adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct the story a little bit, the king is the thief's companion, not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying for the imaginative and adventurous young boys. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a vintage piece - I think at the age of eleven or twelve, my son will find it "corny" or whatever word the next generation will use by then. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as one cynical friend put it: "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the story demands it." Abu's willingness to put himself (repeatedly) at risk for the deposed fallen king is equally unlikely. But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, thirty-meter geniuses and the temple of the eye that sees everything would be ridiculous to the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy at the climax of the film is huge, as is the last shot of Abu flying triumphantly on his magic carpet (stolen), looking for "something fun and adventure finally!"
