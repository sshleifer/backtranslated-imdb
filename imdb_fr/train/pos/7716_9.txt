There is a good reason for Walter Pidgeon to warn Leslie Nielson and his crew of the relief ship, things he does not dare to dream about. <br /> <br /> As Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that took place on this planet 20 years ago. Since then, he has married another member of the expedition and has had a daughter, Anne Francis. These are the only remaining humans on this planet that was once the birthplace of an ancient civilization known as Krell. <br /> <br /> The recordings deciphered by Pidgeon indicate that the Krell has reached a cataclysmic end of unknown origin. The machines they left are still working. <br /> <br /> Maybe they work too well if the members of the rescue group start dying and in a horrible way. <br /> <br /> I see all kinds of speculations on a remake and it's a film not to be redone because it's as fresh as in 1956. The terms would change, we would now say "speed of chain "instead of" hyper drive ", courtesy of the enduring popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We could not see the men participating in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like a spaceship. It may look more like the Starship Enterprise or the 2001 ship, a space odyssey. It's interesting to watch science-fiction films of different generations and see how the conceptions of the future are changing. <br /> <br /> The story of Forbidden Planet is a timeless story where mortal beings try to play God. <Br /> <br /> You can not write about Forbidden Planet without commenting Robby the Robot. This mechanical wonder, developed by Pidgeon with the knowledge gained while studying Krell, was a real success. He had a new life in the sixties with the robot character of Lost In Space. His scenes with Earl Holliman, who plays the cook on board the spacecraft, and his acquiescence to Earl's request for some spirits of the house are very amusing. <br /> <br /> Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but were lost The Ten Commandments and the separation of the Red Sea. The misfortune of Forbidden Planet against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> The classics among you will recognize that Forbidden Planet is a futuristic rehandling of The Tempest which, when you think about it, could have been Shakespeare's. to venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite among the actors is Warren Stevens. His sacrifice allows Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he is dealing with. <br /> <br /> Never miss this one when it airs.
