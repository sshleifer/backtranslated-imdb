Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film, but it left a bitter taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the other hand, is slightly less polite, but by far a better movie. It is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historical values, while Braveheart gives a dreadful contemporary brilliant to an ancient tale. What makes this film is the casting. Liam Neeson plays the hero in a role that he essentially resumed (dilutedly) in the Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demoniac of lovers. Admirable but human, he controls the screen. Against him, a selection of equally human opponents, including odd but brilliant Tim Roth's Cunningham, and John Hurt's morally bankrupt laird. Jessica Lange, Rob's pragmatic wife, also deserves praise: strong and noble too, but 300 years of a modern heroine, who is only what she should be. This is not the most original movie you'll see, but it has the courage of its own convictions, and the strong performances make you attentive.
