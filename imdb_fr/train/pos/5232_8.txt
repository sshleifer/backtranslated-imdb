This film is a journey in the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the still illusory question of who am I and what am I? It is a courageous and stimulating venture. There are a multitude of beautiful images, paradoxes inspired by dreams and resembling Escher, which recall the fact that the hand is drawing or rather fades. We are following more and more the writer in his agony on what to say and film, we see him calling his wife who went to Peru, leaving him to take care of their baby, a task he accomplishes with less attention until he is so absorbed by his dilemma that he hardly looks at the child anymore. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him to cross the last threshold until he fades. Riddled with attractive and destructive images, the story is primarily philosophical. These are the veils of Maya, the world of illusion. However, the paradox of the film is that it takes a lot of talking and thinking to prove that the reflection must stop. For more than two hours of provocative beauty and philosophizing quickly, the film made me aspire to silence or a shorter film. If that was the goal of the manufacturer, he was very successful.
