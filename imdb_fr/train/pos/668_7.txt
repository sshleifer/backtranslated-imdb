I just watched "The Last Wave" in my school's fine arts library. It's intriguing, like all of Peter Weir's articles, but it's not always as appealing as I would have liked. I was fascinated by the ideas that were thrown at me (because they are very well managed by the director Weir) but, at the same time, they did not stimulate me enough. AKA I got a little bored in places. <br /> <br /> The plot quotes an Australian lawyer obsessed with certain dreams that binds him to an Aboriginal group he defends. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense meteorological sequence and has very impressive mood effects (including the weird sound, a "belching sound") and a strong direction; but that just did not entertain me like Weir's latest movies do. However, I may just need to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Good movie about obsession and mystery. In the end, the mystery between whites and aboriginals has very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> God bless Peter Weir, however. For him alone, this film deserves to be watched ... director very bio. As an Australian answer Malick! I would give him a 7 because he has enough good ideas to overcome his boring moments.
