So, being a fan of horror movies, I have not seen one that really made me jump (or move nervously). <br /> <br /> I will definitely have it on DVD when it comes out ... much better than the ring. The only thing I do not understand is that so many people we talked to after the movie thought it was awful, well, if that's what you think, then be it .. I know what I liked and it takes That's enough for me to be really scared, so I have to say that this one deserves to be watched. Now, you might be disappointed with the story if you need everything in an orderly and orderly line, because the plot goes back a bit forward to help build the story (I think if it was shown in the chronological order would have ruined everything.) <br /> <br /> I'm really happy that this movie contained very little bloody damage ... maybe the rest of your studio writers and everyone will realize that you will not have to splash red content to scare people.
