This Biograph short film was so much fun to watch. The second on D.W.'s record One Griffith's "Years of Discovery" DVD kit (highly recommended) contains three excellent interpretations of the main actors. It is also interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) incarnated as an eye-giver (and other things). <br /> <br /> The Countess's husband is unleashed at his wife's betrayal and has her partitioned in a small room with her mistress. It's a bit incredible not to hear the wall rise, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here, Mr. Johnson (mum Raymond Hackett's father) wildly gesticulates, which adds to the melodrama, but quite comically. The best moment comes in the end. As the lady faints with fear and shock, once she realizes that she is doomed to fail, Henry picks up her instrument and "supports" it over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and strangely sexy, and I just lost it and laughed. The expression on his face! From that moment, I was charmed by Henry B. Walthall.
