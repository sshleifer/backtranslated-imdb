An opium den, a dirty little boy (actually a dwarf), prostitutes galore, a violent crash in a dive, a motel for sexual scheming, girls dressed very lightly with a cleavage, a boozer falling in the air. stairs, a mixed clientele in a bar with Asians, Africans and Anglos treated the same way, does it look like a film that is played at the local mall? False. These are all scenes from a 1933 musical. <br /> <br /> The first half of "Footlight Parade" is the preparation of a musical show that will occupy the last part of the film. Chester Kent (Cagney) is about to lose his job and loses his wife playgirl as a result of breakdowns of photos featuring musicals. His producers take him to a popular talkie of the day, John Wayne, in "The Big Trail". Before each screening of the film, a dance number is presented in the form of a prologue. Short films, short stories, series and cartoons will be used later. Kent has the idea that a chain of prologues would be the way of salvation for the falling music business. Kent is essentially an inspired man of choreographer Busby Berkeley. Could it be that Cagney's character is inspired by Berkeley? Could be. <br /> <br /> In anticipation of prologues, Kent learns that his ideas are stolen by a rival. He discovers the traitor, pulls him, then, without his knowledge, a new escape is created in the form of a dazzling temptress. Her assistant, Nan Prescott (Joan Blondell - soon Mrs. Dick Powell) loves everyone for Kent and is determined to reveal the tricks of the temptress. A new singer from Arkansas College appears in the form of Scotty Blain (Dick Powell) which turns out to be a real find and is paired with Bea Thorn (Ruby Keeler). The three resulting musicals, which could not have been featured on any of the day's movie theaters, are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were seventy years ago: "Honeymoon Hotel" , "By a Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil." <br /> <br /> Note the song and dance of the sturdy James Cagney. Like Fred Astaire and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Cagney's dance seemed natural and not apprehended, although hours were devoted to practice so that each step was perfect. Not as good a singer as Astaire, the song of Cagney, like that of Astaire, seemed natural, unlike the singer so popular at the time. It is amazing that a person can be as talented and versatile as James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Most critics prefer the "Shanghai Lil" segment to the other two. Yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of "By a Waterfall" is amazing. How Berkeley was able to film underwater ballets and create the string of human snakes had to be difficult because it never happened again. Close-ups mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must. Black and white photography is much more artistic than if it had been shot in color. <br /> <br /> Although not as socially conscious as "Gold Diggers of 1933", "Footlight Parade" is one of the most amazing and scandalous musicals ever on the big screen.
