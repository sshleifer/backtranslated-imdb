I did not know the real events when I sat down to watch this, just the fact that it was based on a true story. After the death of the girl's father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Désirée (... I did not know anyone who actually named their offspring) to cope with the loss. This is really done for children, as is often the case with "family" movies (that said, go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing, even if I would keep teens away, except if you are sure I will buy the concept), but that does not minimize the impression that the death of a parent is dead, and it is not really unobtrusive. The plot is interesting enough and is moving pretty well. The actors vary, the excellent Burstyn surpassing most other members of the group, Mathis following him rather well, and Ferland and his peers (with a few exceptions) are the least convincing of the group (and frankly, they are irritating; I'm not really in the target audience for this thing). Editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that. Although humor is limited to a handful of fun lines, the tone is not unpleasant. There is an intense scene or two in this. I recommend it to fans of these types of movies. 7/10
