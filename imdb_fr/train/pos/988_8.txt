I liked this film. When the guy who stole $ 40 million from a bank dies, his cell mate is used as "bait" to drive him to his tech partner, the mad killer (using a surveillance device implanted in his jaw to his blind). ). It's an action and spy movie with enough comic scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of Enemy Of The State. Well done and pretty good plot.
