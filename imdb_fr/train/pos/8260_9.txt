The French and the Germans have a long history of not loving each other. It is interesting to note that the translation of Kamerdaschaft or camaraderie took place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler besieged Germany and began his plans to conquer the world, France losing its ambitions. But these are moments of serenity compared to the future. A group of miners on the border trying to move to France to find work. They are repulsed and later in a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster occurs in the mines of the French and a well-designed and written scene, a troupe of German miners decides to come to the rescue. A simple story is not it? Pabst was a silent film poet and I'm not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is to be discovered. He is not fussy but brings brutal realism to the test. There is even a turning back on a World War II event that draws attention to the meaning of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the film organizes events with pride and candor. Sometimes that's what a movie has to be.
