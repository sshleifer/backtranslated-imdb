I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most was the music. It worked both ways: in the first hour of the movie, it gives the viewer a period of time. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now perfectly matches the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> I did not just enjoy the music, but I also enjoyed the casting. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a surprise to me. He offered a first class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie about escaping from the already prepared life twice, and both times I had a lot of fun.
