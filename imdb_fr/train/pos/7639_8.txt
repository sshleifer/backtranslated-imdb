It's not a big movie. The acting is not surprising (some sublets are even badly played), the film is not beautiful at all. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like big movies, this one is not for you. yet he has a big - really bigger on the story. Larry's story works because we know this story of our own lives. The girl we did not ask for an appointment, the test we failed, the friend we dropped, are all part of our story. This film works because it touches him. It's a beautiful story because it's a small one. This is the life we ​​all have, with the regrets we all have, and yet the message is valid: every life we ​​could have lived would have had its disadvantages. The first time I looked at it, I was 15 years old. We showed it at a party at my school. 16 years later, I think about it from time to time, and every time I see it, it makes me smile. Look at this. It will do you good. You will be happier with what you have.
