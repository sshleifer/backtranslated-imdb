It's an excellent modern film noir ... "excellent" in that it's interesting from start to finish. There are some holes here and some wacky parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ..... but I have not found anyone who did not let themselves be trapped in this story. The film has the right amount of action, suspense, twists and interesting characters. In addition, it has nice colors and cinematography and a good soundtrack for guitar. <br /> <br /> I called this crime movie a "black film" because it's gritty and all the characters are not good. Even the only supposedly good player, played by Nicholas Cage, gets into trouble by lying and has a quick deal that he should not have had. He's also doing something in the end that's wrong, but I'm not going to ruin it by saying it. Suffice to say that the rest of the characters are so bad that they make Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys", does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not a lot. At least in the "disturbed" category, it's hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a variety of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another excellent supporting performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that never got much publicity, but it should be so. You will have fun watching this. By the way, try to pronounce the name of this film aloud three times faster without spoiling it!
