Since the beginning of the show, Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her ?! The show is not the same as before. His situation is worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes have been with Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! It's like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! This is not true! The niece who replaced her is right, yuck! Terrible. It does not fit the scenario at all. She was one of the main characters and the niece can not replace her. She was a great actress. Much better than the niece. Collect it or you will lose a ton of viewers.
