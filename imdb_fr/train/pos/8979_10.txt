I loved this film. At first, the smooth graphics seemed strange to the grainy film, but I quickly plunged into it. There must have been thousands of hours of filming and I really admire the work done to reduce it. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be the film, but great characters (and real snipers). Technically, I liked that a lot too, they had to have used a new deinterlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the movie looked so dark anyway but I was not bothered by the usual artifacts seen in film transfers. (Open Water has driven me crazy, mainly because there are cheap progressive cameras and I see no excuse not to bomb one if you intend to go to the movies). Sorry it's my own little speech. I definitely recommend this film if you have already been involved in the music scene, it contains tragic moments but most is hilarious, I could be accused of laughing at other misfortunes, but it is a classic.
