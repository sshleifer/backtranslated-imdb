Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh are starring here. Cage and Boyle are doing well, but what gives his neo-black juice is the scary and violent character of Hopper and the stealthiness of JT Walsh. <br /> <br /> A vagabond takes himself for a hit-boy and tries to make a little dough out, but gets over his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this film, when Cage enters a Wyoming caravan to do some drilling with the help of his friend. and the opening scene of Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But this is another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... daring, naughty, ruthless, boiling and fiercely explosive. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as a man with a dark past who tries to live legitimately (well almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real characters to note here, with the exception of hard-working assistant in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first turn comes early, and from there, it's a beautiful neo-black adventure in a sleepy little town. Satisfactory. 8 pts.
