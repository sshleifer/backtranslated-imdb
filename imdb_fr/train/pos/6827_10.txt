I spent 5 hours soaked in this movie. Nothing I've ever seen comes close to the delicious funk that this film has left me. No matter, women, the dilemma of advanced aging, human fear are hiding behind the screen for your viewing. Taking a personal commitment to the ninth degree, the film invests one with an undeniable sense of sharing our lives. I enjoyed this allegiance with a raw bile hurt from the inside. It allows a garment shared in the history of human encounters to delve deeper into the pain, isolation and skewed vision of oneself and others. The result forgives our lukewarm bridge formation away from the muddy mud of deaths we must encounter. Birth in the search for real people is a happy pursuit. The effort of realism cuts across the dark background of our failing culture.
