It's an exquisite movie about finding happiness in everyday life. The rhythm, the work of the camera, the emotions, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this image make it an essential place. It's not easy to understand for the immature or the worst emotions. The only flaw I can see about this movie is that it was not captured in a more technically perfect movie format. He deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the beautiful sound format available. (An intimate film can be shot in seventy millimeters). beautifully seen and heard. In the current state of things, it still deserves the attention of a small film sweet and moving. I can not help but watch him every time he arrives by satellite. The transformations of the content characters, tight and suspicious is always a pleasure to watch and I should recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> The cast is perfect, the atmosphere is perfect, the acting is blameless. It's a film about the average age and the choices people make. It is deep and thoughtless without overpowering the viewer with manual heaviness. Look at him in one sitting and let him act. If you do not get it, you may not have enough experience or something else is wrong with you.
