A charming and funny film that gets a solid note all around. I saw a movie from this movie recently at work. It was so nice to see this movie in contrast to all the shitty horror movies I see every day. So much so that I thought of writing. I do not know if this film will be screened in theaters, but I hope that is the case. It's a beautiful movie to do with friends, it's a charmer, and it has some funny jokes. The acting was great (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf) The staging was pretty good (not a movie that deserved to be over-realized) What really sets this movie apart, I think, is the It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish and the joke between the characters is smart and has a good pace.As a budding screenwriter, I notice these things! (I'm a dork) In any case, a movie really cute that I recommend.
