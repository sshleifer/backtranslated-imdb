At first, I did not really know if I wanted to watch this movie when it appeared on my guide. So I consulted on IMDb and found that the cover looked pretty cool. So I decided to try a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> Once I passed the fact that I'm supposed not to like the character of Alicia played beautifully by Busy Phillips, I realized how good this movie was doing to establish the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so mean to Deanna played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the film, but we finally discover that despite their polar opposition, they have one thing in common: being present during filming. They share the solitude and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> I have to say how much I liked this movie and was happy to see all the positive comments that were made about it. I could not even cross Elephant because it seemed to exploit the Columbine tragedy. This film was convincing and realistic. Busy Phillips acting is out of the chain! This is a good thing and I would like to see her evolve into more mature roles.
