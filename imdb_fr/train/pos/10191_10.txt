What's in this disc is a first-rate show by a first-rate band. This disc is NOT for sensitive souls, the music is incredibly intense and VERY cool. What you learn from watching this movie is why the Who was so huge for so long. It is true that their records were excellent, but their shows were at the top. In 1969, when this concert was shot, the gaudy teenies who threw jelly beans at the Beatles had disappeared and the bands (and audiences) had become used to long and astonishing musical virtuosity - something that few viewers have intellectual curiosity continue in the era of canned music by Britney and Christina. What you are learning here is the incredible things that can happen when talented musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
