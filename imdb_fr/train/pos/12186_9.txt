It's not a movie as great as many people think (including my deceased aunt, who said it was her favorite movie). But because of the best sections of this film noir, especially its famous "fun house" final, THE LADY SHANGHAI has acquired a position that far exceeds its current value as a key to the saga of the failure of Orson Welles to conquer Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In 1946, Welles' position as a Hollywood figure is mixed. CITIZEN KANE has not been recognized as the big film that has been seen since, because of the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by the Hollywood insiders themselves. Welles' attempt to totally control (direction, production and play) of his films seemed to threaten the entire system. His best work in this period was that of Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE, who would have been shot by Robert Stevenson, but which was also shot in large part (with Stevenson's blessing) by Welles. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a movie with a postwar interest in fleeing Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood, it was hardly a good record. <br /> <br /> Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to regain her critical abilities through the production of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. Despite the assistance of Mike Todd and Cole Porter in the composition of the score, the musical was a failure. His failure occurred just when his wife, Rita Hayworth, was on the rise with her portrait of GILDA. So the wedding was going as bad as expected. <br /> <br /> Welles had to make money - her Broadway production had led to her personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest for possible film rights on AROUND THE WORLD to Todd (which he would end up by street), and also sold the idea of ​​a film about Henri Desire Landru's career to Charlie Chaplin, who was supposed to be realized there (and that turned him into MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> It is said that Welles, with a tax bill of $ 10,000.00 to worry, called Cohn and offered to make a film with Rita for a down payment. Cohn was willing to do it, but of course, he asked what the film was. It was a wise question. Welles was on the public telephone in New York at a pharmacy that had a book department. He grabbed a book with the title "THE LADY OF SHANGHAI" and said he was delighted with the quality of this thriller. In a way, Welles convinced Cohn, normally astute, that he knew what he was talking about. Cohn stated that he would seek the rights and sent Welles his $ 10,000 deposit. After Cohn hung up, Welles bought the book and read it - and found it really bad. He spent time rewriting a treatment and script that would reinforce Rita's character Elsa Bannister. <br /> <br /> The development of the plot is curious. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / longshoreman. He rescues Elsa Bannister, while she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a crippled criminal and renowned. She convinces him to hire Michael as skipper of their yacht. The cruise also includes Bannister's grim partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia), who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to monitor Elsa. When they can, Michael and Elsa are trying to find time together, but Broome or Grisby continue to appear. <br /> <br /> Grisby makes an offer to Michael - he wishes (for reasons related to his so-called fatalistic vision of modern society) to give up pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plot becomes obscure here), he can still recover his life insurance (although deceased?) And use it to flee to the South Seas. He will pay Michael $ 10,000 if he claims to shoot Grisby. This includes actually signing a document attesting the murder (Michael does not realize that such a confession would erase the need to produce a corpse if all other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead). <br /> <br /> Of course, Grisby is killed, and Michael is arrested for this, and for the murder of Broome (shot with Michael's gun). Michael is judged by Bannister who defends him, and discovers that he is doing a second-rate job because he wants Michael to be sentenced. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the real murderer and manages to escape just before the verdict of the jury. He is stunned and put in an abandoned carnival, which leads us to the famous sequence "Fun House" and the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly confusing film (as I had already commented). . That does not mean it's not worth seeing, it's striking. Attend the fight between Michael and the police at the trial judge's premises, where he puts the bailiff in the judge's library, breaking the glass. Or the intelligent use of photography to capture Hayworth diving into a rock, as evidenced by Grisby's lush twins. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, especially Sloane (probably the best role in this movie). Glenn Anders was a major Broadway actor. He rarely made films before THE LADY OF SHANGHAI, and his lank Grisby is unforgettable. Ted De Corsia also works very well with Broome - a detective who really looks for his own interests, at his own expense. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, she turns into a performance that differs from most of the previous (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN, and THE BLAISE STRAWBERRY are exceptions), and that's a memorable siren. Welles' O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a friendly but naive man who has trouble learning not to believe what he secretly wants to believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, but it's a good movie for all of this.
