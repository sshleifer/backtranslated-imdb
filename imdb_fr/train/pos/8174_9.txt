I love that movie. As a child, it was one of the first films I saw that made me flinch. Of course, it's sweet now, but at the time it was great. Dentists are one thing that so many people fear, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's nerdy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's great. And I have always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone to perfection, no one could have done it better. And for a low-budget horror movie, the effects and the like are pretty good. And I also like the theme of music, it's fine with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) also plays a curious cop and does a great job. There is a good amount of blood and scenes of torture / death really cool. Check this one!
