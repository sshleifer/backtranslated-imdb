I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was great, as the plot Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized. The only part of this film that I would like to change was the end. The creature's death was way too horrible for the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this film. Jeff Combs obviously played a figure of the Messiah and the creature (or the shark if you prefer) represented the anti-Chirst. Some particularly scary scenes have had the sensation of "end of the world". I only noticed it after my third viewing of this classic creature feature. I know that many people will not get the references to Christianity, but if you look at them closely, you will get them.
