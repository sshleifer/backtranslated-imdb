This is a very moving image of 3 best friends in their forties in a small town in England. We find passionate love and a new beginning with a young piano instructor, When tragedy strikes and hearts change forever. Certainly a movie to have a box of tissues with you! A powerful job. It's certainly one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOIL ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is portrayed by her young and seductive piano teacher and a passionate romance blossoms. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature joke that quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends all at once. At the end, an unexpected surprise brings them together (in my opinion, his forgiveness is not justified)
