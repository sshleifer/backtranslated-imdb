I come from Belgium and my writing in English is bad enough, sorry for that ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those little known films that only goes on television once which seems to disappear in the air. . I was browsing my old collection of VHS videos and I came across this title. I looked for it and the IMDb score exceeded 7/10, which is quite correct. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this is a very good set up movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director ...? How come he did not make a lot of movies after this one rather good ...? Someone who has so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ah ah ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would really like him to pull himself together and do another good movie like this, please .....?
