Here, on IMDb.com, I read an opinion that Gray Owl is the best Pierce Brosnan character ever played. I do not know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was really exceptional. <br /> <br /> The other thing - the director's impressive hand. I give my respect. The serenity, beauty and spirit of nature were illustrated in a truly exclusive way. I had never encountered such proximity in any movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing that stays in my mind after the movie - it's the closest movie to the original books and their atmosphere. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I pay tribute to the original Gray Owl.
