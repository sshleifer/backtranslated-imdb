This film is close to being my favorite piece of celluloid. There is really not much to say or say here. Except perhaps "See this film" and "Enjoy the excellent work of Daniel and Pascal", which transports you through this neat, funny and heartbreaking story on the theme "Spend your eighth day", your day! <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie made me think about how I spent my eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we should do. Whether to please a career or simply to consume TV shows and baseball games. What we usually miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - making a difference. About taking up space and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW! (the eighth day) ... At least, that's what I got in "The Eighth Day".
