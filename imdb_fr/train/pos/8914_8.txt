I grew up in Royersford, Pennsylvania. The city where the Jerry market was. I remember all my family who went to watch the shoot. I remember a guy who showed us the "Blob" with my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share the fact that my mother was in the movie. Her hair was the same as Aneta Corsaut's and she was sick one night. They saw my mother and he asked to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for injections from behind. They paid him $ 25.00 and told him a story until his death last August. My mother was not a teenager and a few months after giving birth to my little sister.
