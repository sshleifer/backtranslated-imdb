This film about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great! <br /> <br /> This is not an idealistic film, I would say it shows life as it was or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place. The characters are very nice but also have "dark" sides, which makes you think that they are real people. Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion" as the main character Gigi would say.
