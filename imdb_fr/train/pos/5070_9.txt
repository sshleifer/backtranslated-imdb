Recently, I was looking for the recently released FLY AWAY HOME widescreen DVD, and I came across an interesting track I had never heard of before: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a film by Richard Attenborough caught my attention (he was responsible for films as refined as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the screenplay was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "special edition" was full of interesting sound materials and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I bought it by chance. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan embodies Archie Gray Owl, a real-life trapper in the 1930s, who came to love, respect and work to protect Canada's wild lands. Brosnan (who played in a James Bond movie) gives a shady, warm and powerful performance, just like Annie Galipeau as a young woman who loves and influences her feeling for the creatures of the earth, especially the beaver. A beautiful score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and a beautiful photograph by Roger Pratt add a lot to the effectiveness of the film. AND the extras of this DVD are something else! Includes two short films made in the 1930s with the real Gray Owl as well as audio commentary tracks from Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 featurettes; and many more PLUS additions for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM capabilities. GRAY OWL was published directly on DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to the lack of interest on the part of Hollywood to distribute something that is not loaded with violence and sex. It is a film that not only informs and entertains, but leaves you to think. I had a very warm feeling at the conclusion of the film - and a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie - to check! It is a project that I hope to share with others.
