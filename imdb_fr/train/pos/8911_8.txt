I've seen The Blob many times and it's one of the best low-budget extraterrestrial invasion movies of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteor is landing just outside a small city ​​and an elderly man is going to investigate. A strange substance-like jelly is then attached to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor arrive in time and takes him to the local doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass grows. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe the young couple and do not accuse them of having invented everything. They end up believing them when the mass, now enormous, is presented in the cinema of the city and that everyone runs in the streets screaming. He then attaches himself to a dinner with the young couple and some others inside. The Blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers and it freezes, which is its weakness. It is then flown to the frozen Arctic waste and disposed of there. But this is only frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This film has a typical decor for its time: teenagers and a small town. The Blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the film is still atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The rest, Beware! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake was released in 1988, but this is the best of The Blob movies. <br /> <br /> The cast is directed by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the film that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I do not know any other stars. <br /> <br /> The Blob is a must for all science fiction fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
