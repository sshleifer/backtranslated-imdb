Sumptuous production values ​​and solid performances in this direct adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between 18th century English classes. Northam and Paltrow form a salutary mix as friends who have to overcome jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a lasting virtue that largely explains the accessibility of old source material (which has been somewhat mitigated by its severe skepticism). I liked the look of the movie and the way the shots were shot, and I thought it did not depend too much on the succession of shots in the head, as do most of the other movies of the '80s and' 90s Very good results.
