Jeff Wincott is not only a handsome kid, he can also kick his ass! This film contains some of the best martial arts movements I have seen for a very long time. Ok, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would hire to play a ruthless politician, she did a great job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this film starring martial arts / stunt expert Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock, Who CARES ?! She is just as good, if not better! (watch his fight scene at the end of the movie, a word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this film as soon as possible, because if you have not seen it, you really miss a good action in martial arts.
