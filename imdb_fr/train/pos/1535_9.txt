Fortunately, as a student, I have been able to attend "Diagnosis Murder" for several years now. This is essentially a doctor who resolves murder with the help of his son LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM has provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What differentiated him from many other police programs and deserved to be watched several times was his cast and the quality of his writing. The main cast has performed well and the roots of Dick Van Dyke's performer have come with magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were the fast pace, the witty scripts and of course the hit score. Unfortunately, this was unfairly compared to "Murder, she wrote". The DM is far superior and offers more mysteries difficult to solve and more variety. Now, television is a worse place. The time of friendly cops and family cops is over. Now, there are only degrading "gritty".
