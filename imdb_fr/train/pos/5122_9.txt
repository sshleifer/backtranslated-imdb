No. 3 in the trilogy of young John Travolta's blockbusters. He dances at disco, rock'n'roll and country. He goes to Houston to find work and love. Gilley's is the hotspot, and it's time for the mechanical bull. Not to be outdone, I rode the bull at a club in Nashville. I recently saw this film almost forgotten on TV and I remembered how good it was and how good the year 1980 was. I wore a black cowboy hat this year, just like Travolta. Debra Winger was at its peak. She looks gorgeous in her red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem like the ideal couple, even if they are badly ordered. They are separating just because it feels good to get back together. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We hear Lyins 'Eyes from The Eagles and Johnny Lee's Lookin' For Love.
