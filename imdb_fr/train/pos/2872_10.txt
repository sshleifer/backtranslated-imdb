In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the mother-in-law (voice of Lucille La Verne) was really diabolical. You will have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housework, Cinderella (voice of Ilene Stanley) was a very beautiful lady. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the distribution was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before closing, I would like to say that everyone involved in this film has been very successful. In conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to anyone who has not seen it. You like to have a good time, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
