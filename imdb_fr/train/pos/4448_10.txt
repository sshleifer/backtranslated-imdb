I saw this film yesterday for the first time and we enjoyed it very much. I am a screenwriting student and I loved the way the minor characters came in at the very moment when something crucial / climatic was happening in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very lively and the story was rather shocking - at one point Barbara Stanwyck flirted openly with her daughter's boyfriend; AND to revive some passion in her husband whom she has not seen for ten years; AND with the shot signal 'two shots, then one', she connects with her former fellow Dutch shag (the reason she left town in the first place!) ALL AT THE SAME TIME! The moral majority must have been totally angry when they saw this movie in the 50s. <br /> <br /> Love the costumes, the cinematography and the dialogue that comes directly from the hip - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Co. doing the 'Bunny Hug' is reason enough to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies of this period that I have seen for a long time.
