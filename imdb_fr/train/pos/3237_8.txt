After my experience of Finland for a little over a week, I would say that this film describes very precisely the nature of Finnish society. The phenomenon of young couples with a baby who have serious problems is very familiar to me, I witnessed the same thing in person when I was in Finland. The relations and problems of the people, the fragility of the marriage institution, the culture of consumption, unemployment and the problem of growing money, are all very well formulated, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are certain points in the movies that are not necessarily easy to understand and relate to each other, but the overall vision that results is nevertheless rewarding. Each of the news is not exciting or profound, but as said above, the overview does not fail to deliver the feeling of "real life" and captivate the viewer. I have been thinking about calm: what's going on in the lives of all those people on the street? Well, that's what's happening. Movies like this are good for nourishing your imaginative power. It would be safe to assume that this film could apply to the life of many countries, but it particularly reflects Finland as it is and very well. <br /> <br /> A comment on the actor: Being a fan of Finnish I'm in the cinema, I've never seen any of these actors in any other film, but I found the acting in this feature film next door, perfect overall. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good test of the whole team. I will keep an eye on future releases of the director and cast. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
