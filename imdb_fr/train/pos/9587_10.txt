Fifteen years later, Paris Is Burning is still in flames. It's a classic black gay movie, just like the other honorary black gay movies, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This flagship work captures the culture and gay community of black and Latin underclass (ie "underserved") like no other work before or since, including all the retrospective and sentimental interpretations of Harlem Renaissance. They're good, but c I say the only "real" film you'll find on the subject: it's Relentlessy Cunty (the classic invention of house house) coming to Hollywood, a hilarious and nonstop camp (as we just do it) and unfailing social criticism. All this by a white director (who obviously had to be Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a previous life.) I could go on, but I think you've understood the point now: I love this movie!
