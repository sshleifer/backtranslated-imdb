Eliminate any discussion of the use of non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The film is 67 years old. In 1937, the studio leaders felt that any actor could / should be able to play any role. The actors were under contract and did not always have the choice of the role they played. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a very beautiful epic story of love, human rights, social strata and men / women. The centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer, who is about to take a wife (Rainer). From the beginning, he treats her with respect, at a time when women were considered mere help. Without revealing the film, they go through the ups and downs of all relationships. Although the story takes place in the late 19th / early 20th century, the story and much of their feelings seem credible. <Br/> <br /> Besides the fact that the film lasts about 5 to 10 minutes longer than necessary, and that the Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly performances are typical 1930s cartoon characters, it's is a truly wonderful film that, unfortunately, has become a victim of politically correct. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
