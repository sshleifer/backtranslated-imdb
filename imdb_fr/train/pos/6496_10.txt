Here's an example of how a documentary from the Second World War should be made, using firsthand accounts of soldiers and civilians involved in this appalling conflict, as well as archival footage collected at that time. A year and a half ago, I did not really know World War II at the time, but it enveloped me and I now consider myself a World War II buff, watching and reading everything I can find out about it, but nothing approaches this historical documentary, it's really worth buying the box set of ............. <br /> <br /> That's all simply a documentary of very high quality.
