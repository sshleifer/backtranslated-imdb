It was another great film by Tom Berenger .. But some people are right it's like it's another character of SGT BARNES, but it was still great .. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the Panama jungle! Like Ryan's Private Ryan's Cpl Upham, Billy Zane was at first a little whimsical, but he became a little more aggressive at the end! Sniper was great and action buffs should watch it .. I remind you that it would not have as much action as a regular action movie ... I also have this one on DVD and it is excellent!
