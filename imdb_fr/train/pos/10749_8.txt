I rented it for my son who recently became interested in 9/11. He was a gardener at the time and had no idea what was going on. I liked the way it was said to be a "documentary". If there was a film that I would recommend to see about 9/11, it would be that one! Normally, you see a movie whose actors are well known. This film had no one known. In addition, you see a movie on 9/11, you learn that a firefighter or two firefighters have lost their lives, saving lives. I did not think it was that! I only rented this movie and would certainly consider adding it to my collection! Very well done indeed! My thoughts are with the survivors and families of the victims of 9/11!
