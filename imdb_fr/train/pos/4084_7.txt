I guess this is supposed to be some kind of editing or updating of "Beauty and the Beast", but I can not say that I've ever watched a movie that started with minutes of sex with horses. Sensational. Anyway, it seems like a young woman and she..aunt? Have traveled to this castle in France where the woman has to marry the son of the owner of the castle, who is the man who takes care to ensure that the horses recover their stones. There seems to be legends in this area of ​​a beast that was rather agitated, I suppose, one might say, with the ladies, or at least one of them in particular. There are all sorts of hidden references in this regard, but every time the bride, who will soon be blushing, will have her curious little hands on one of the hands of the husband's father, it will escape her sight. Anyway, the bride goes to bed waiting for the family to wait for a cardinal to go to the wedding (a family member, I guess) and dreaming, she dreams of a beast in the woods go with it. The effects in this game leave a little to be desired, and any attempt at eroticism (even if I do not know much about it) is quite laughable, especially when some appendages are as realistic as a post or a baseball bat . It has a pretty strange and abrupt end, but it's twisted, with not really clues or a lot of emphasis, but it was quite appropriate and it certainly was not what I expected. I do not know, it's a little difficult to do but it has its moments and it's really weird. 7 out of 10
