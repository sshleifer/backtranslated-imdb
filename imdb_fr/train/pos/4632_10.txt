Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox, scriptwriter / director of the much-loved 2002 feature film "Yossi & Jagger" (2002). This comparative epic, at one hour and 53 minutes, is another romantic drama in which we face tragedy and celebrate beauty and joie de vivre. Westerners, especially urban gay men like me, need to be moved out of our safe haven and informed about real life and the struggle for death elsewhere to be able to enjoy equity. <br /> <br /> While "Yossi & Jagger" "Ha Buah" is centered on a group of civil, heterosexual and homosexual friends, who share a unit in the heart of the tolerant gay Israeli community, but not about Israeli military service. always gay-friendly, capital of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> "Ha Buah" opens on a scene of dramatic border control in which Noam (Ohad Knoller (Yossi) of "Yossi & Jagger") meets for the first time a beautiful young Arab Ashraf ( Yousef Sweid). Romance soon blossoms ?? but in this political climate, opportunities must be seized quickly or totally lost. <br /> <br /> From here we follow a complex interaction between members and roommate lovers and the inevitable effect of the very conservative family of Ashraf. If you follow the dialogue of this film with enough attention, you will have no reason to be disappointed by the end. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of "Ha Buah" is bright and the graphics are both beautiful and striking ?? that is, real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> English subtitles are very easy to follow and allow you to relax quickly and enjoy the best of world cinema.
