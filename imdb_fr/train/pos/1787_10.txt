The Danish character finally allowed Buddy to know the terrible truth. "Leave me alone, kiss men if you want," she screams righteously in front of everyone, thus destroying the man who has loved her for so long. Pretty girl. It may be the perfect place to reconsider everything A great reason to feel sympathy for her, lying down and dying, but hey, remember, there's no mistake except maybe to be seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute, this irony is planned! It's actually an ironic masterpiece, yes! But I doubt that this is what the authors of the film had in mind, unfortunately. Maybe there are some mistakes, after all.
