This luck-inspired 1939 military swashbuckler, based vaguely on Rudyard Kipling's memorable poem and his novel "Soldiers Three", is considered first-class entertainment about the British imperial army in India. 1880s. Cary Grant strikes louder with his fists in the air than in all his films. Located in far-off India, this six-fist wire is based on the exploits of three robust British sergeants and their native water carrier, Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who face a bloodthirsty Indian cult called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Victor McLaglen, Oscar winner of "The Informer"), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of "The Dawn Patrol" ) form a competition trio. from Alpha who drink, drink hard, and love fun and whose fun-loving years are on the verge of becoming a story, because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and embark on tea. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney invent various plans to derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors order their return to combat with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney, drugged Higginbotham so that he could not accompany them and Ballantine must replace him. Half of the fun here is watching the directors try to thwart themselves without hating each other. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure with style and magnitude as our heroes mingle with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August has been nominated for the Oscars for his remarkable black and white cinematography.
