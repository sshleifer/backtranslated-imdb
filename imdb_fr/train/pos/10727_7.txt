This is a family film that, for some people, turns off automatically. It seems that too many people do not want to see movies that are not cluttered with missing arms and legs, free violence and explosives to fill the New York phone book. This film is none of this. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. This does not require you to think, it does not require you to accept the film as a reality. This is just what a good movie should do, namely to suspend voluntarily disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The casting is good, but not excellent. As another speaker noted, John Williams' sound note was, as usual, excellent. And the fact that much of the film was shot in Huntsville during the real space camp made it even more believable. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the film's release was delayed by a few months due to the Challenger shuttle disaster, which may have played an important role in its original theatrical opening, but the film has finally helped to refocus the dreams of many young people to the space and the possibilities that are there. So sit with your kids and get ready to enjoy them.
