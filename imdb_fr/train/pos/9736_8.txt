Pegg has had some success in recent years, beginning with "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004 and then with the movie "Hot Fuzz 2007". In early 2008, he came out with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now comes, "How to lose friends and alienate people" which is in many ways one of my favorite comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a failed magazine that makes fun of celebrities because he is not one of them. Be that as it may, one of the most successful magazine owners (Played By Jeff Bridges) invites him (Out of nostalgia) to work for his magazine. Sidney is naturally enthusiastic and goes to America where he meets a girl who is currently writing a book and hilarity ensues. <br /> <br /> This movie is great and I hope other films will be like this one in the near future. Pegg has once again offered everyone another good movie and I can not wait to see the third part of the trilogy of blood and ice cream "Paul". I give this movie 81%.
