This fabulous film must be seen, knowing that millions of people have raised 10 cents to see it and forget the dark economic conditions that were experienced in the 30s. Remember that 10 cents bought a loaf of bread at the time, which was therefore a minor luxury for many people. It's a testament to how Hollywood has done its best to make the United States feel a little better about themselves. You will notice that with the Hollywood studio system at the time, many actors and actresses were typographed in similar movies, for example. James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee. In addition, branches of the US military have always been respected with enthusiasm and patriotism, as evidenced by the use of military precision in the end by the great choreographer Busby Berkeley.
