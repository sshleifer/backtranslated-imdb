At 35, Groove Tube looks a lot like today's TV! Special niche networks (nudity sports), a television show about stoner drug traffickers called the Dealers (ala Weeds, and even prior to Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke of 1978), strange beer commercials (Butz Beer, no less weird than Bud Bowls), dirty Koko (the shades of Pee Wee Herman), a cheerful clown, or even Chevy Chase to make silly humor (a violent barber vocal duet) a year before his debut in 1975 with Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned Groove Tube an initial X-rating, I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking of naked hippies dancing in hitchhiking - --- For similar fashionable sketch films, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Beyond the Fringe of Monty Python, Dynamite Chicken and all you know that is wrong in the Firesign Theater .
