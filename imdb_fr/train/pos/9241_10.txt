Hi people, what's up. This is me guy, the one and only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ... you can not really write a review about Sakura's script because we did not have one. As far as I know, the story was invented as and when. I had the best time of my life doing this movie and I was so smelly that I ran out of Jism ... so glad you all enjoyed the movie. I really did not have to do the fights I had envisioned. Every time I organized movements, the director of the fight changed them constantly. Still, I had a blast and met really great people. Especially the purple Ninja woman who seems to be falling off the film scene.
