I thought the kids in the movie were great. I deal with children in this age group and I thought their behavior was very credible. I had a problem with the reference to private parts made by the 5 year old. I did not think the commentary was necessary and, in fact, my opinion of the movie has decreased slightly <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is a rising star. I would like to see more of him on the big screen. I appreciated his reactions to the situations in which he found himself. Often children in this age group do things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors have done it throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I also think that the message of bullying should be more taken into account in the films of this age group. This is a major problem in schools today. <br /> <br /> The end was pretty unexpected. Billy's thoughts on whether he won the bet were very surprising. How he handled this situation was excellent. Too often today, children are not willing to compromise. The actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
