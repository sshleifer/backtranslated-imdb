This stoner Alec Guinness is a very good political satire of the corporate world and a slightly eccentric study of the characters. <br /> <br /> The pace is a little slow for a comedy, and none of that really turns - on the funny type ground, except maybe the sound effects for the experiments. But he has his fun moments and he is very skilled in his execution. The segment of big explosions is probably the most wacky element. <br /> <br /> Trade union procedures are quite lamentable and are reminiscent of those of I 'ALL RIGHT BLACK; especially the female socialist with a slight romantic crush on the Guinness character. Political machinations actually carry history. Ernest Thesigner is very remarkable as heavy. <br /> <br /> I do not think it works as well as THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even the light comedy Ealing is better than nothing.
