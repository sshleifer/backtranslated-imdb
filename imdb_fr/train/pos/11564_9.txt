I have seen this movie many times and I like all the bad teachers who want to give ten out of ten, but I think it would be unfair for other good movies. However, I think it's one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. It's one of the greatest comic movies of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and incompatible. The script is so precise that you have to stop the bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other reviews. The two leaders give extraordinary performances, the girls are superb and the situations are very funny. Not a single word in sight (note that Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you must be witty) and the transition from the stage to the movie is fluid. They do not do it anymore. Timeless.
