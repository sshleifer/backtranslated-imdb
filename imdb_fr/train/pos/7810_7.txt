What does "Cry Freedom" look like? It's simply a great and unique experience of doing South Africa and the way Blacks in this country have been repressed by whites. The main character in the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, where he speaks critically about the views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Woods will soon meet Biko and he will change his mind about him. He will also begin to understand what the authorities are doing to blacks in South Africa (from the top, even from the chief of police). When Biko dies in custody, Woods decides that he has to write a book about him and whatever he has to publish it. But Woods must escape from his country for this book to be published and he must also place his family in second place, so that the world can discover the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough has managed to make a good movie about people, with The main message is that black and white are the same because we are all people. The story takes us to South Africa and this film is a great way for the world to learn about what happened in this country and I am disappointed that only 3,200 people have evaluated this film. It's a film from which we can all learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story could not be presented more briefly because the director wanted to show us how difficult it was for Woods to publish this book after the death of Biko. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Biko was also highlighted, as were the families of these two people and all the problems they face. But sometimes sacrifices have to be made (Biko's death) for the truth to be revealed (Woods book).
