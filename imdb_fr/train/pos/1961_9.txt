I just came back from the first broadcast of Basic Instinct 2. I thought it would be a bad idea, based on the reviews of the previews, and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original basic instinct, I think you will enjoy as much, if not more, the No. 2. Beautiful story that keeps you thinking and thinking. The music is superb, taking the theme of the original. Do not wait for the Oscars material, go see it for fun and fun. That's why films are designed - escape. I can not think of a better way to escape than to flee with Sharon Stone, who is as sexy as she has ever been. I think to see him again this weekend. Go see him!
