Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and other popular adventures during the eighties. Wayne Crawford is played by Jake Speed, an adventurer who always fights evildoers wherever he goes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), they travel the globe in search of action (and decent scenarios). The duo meets a young woman, Margaret (Karen Kopins), whose sister was kidnapped by a wicked white slave dealer (John Hurt). Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her rescue her brother? <br /> <br /> A shabby and nerdy movie that does not pretend to be something that it is not. I must give a recommendation to this one. This is the case if you like movies that like to have fun and those who do not take everything for nothing. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
