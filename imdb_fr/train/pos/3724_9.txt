Tigerland follows the life of a group of newly recruited men in the military who are expected to fight in Vietnam in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this point, the United States knows they are conducting a lost battle and the director takes us through a 16mm documentary pocket documentary about the lives of several recruits in the "Tigerland" training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The film is more of a character study than a plot, a character Roland Boz, a man both dissociated and intelligent, who only wants to escape the camp. Several characters from the unit wait for us while waiting for the story to unfold. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it's a beautiful story about Vietnam and, more importantly, about the army in general. and very memorable. In addition, the film and style used by the directors work so well, because they look a lot like the old movies you still see in Vietnam. It's great to see how the film shows that all the internal conflicts and all the problems were so important for the fight. The particular scene where Boz moves away from a training mission where an instructor shows how to use a radio as an instrument of torture sums up almost everything about the war in one word ... and its futility. <br /> <br /> Fantastic film. Not only about Nam, but also about the people who have to decide what is morally right by being "in the army". <br /> <br /> Rating 9 of 10.
