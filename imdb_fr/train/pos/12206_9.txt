Among all the black films of the 1940s and 1950s, it must be one of the strangest and most entertaining to watch. I say this because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but the last two have made this movie so entertaining for me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby", is one of the strangest people I've ever seen in a movie. His voice and some of his words must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blond hair, but she's still Hayworth, which means a lot to eye if you're a guy. Welles is still fascinating. Tip: If you have the DVD, turn on English subtitles. His character in this movie is Irish and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also made the film, which means you have excellent camera angles and beautiful close-ups of the face. You also have a unique end, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great thing! As weird as this movie was, I always thought that the carnival atmosphere resembling a jester at trial, towards the end, was too strong and would take away the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, nothing to complain about. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent entertainment, it's the name of the game.
