What I expected: a representation a bit lame and too stereotypical of a guy crazy about sport and a representation equally lame of the young man who likes him but suffers while being the second support banal his support too zealous for his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: An unbiased story in which a man and a girl end up admitting - between themselves and themselves - that they all have passions in their lives and that everyone can to forgive each other to save the love they share. . <br /> <br /> It sounds sappy, but with non-stop humor and extraordinary performance, this story works! Barrymore is a Barrymore classic: this perfect mix of sweet, strong and adorable. We are waiting for her and she has delivered us. <br /> <br /> But Fallon is the beautiful surprise of this film. He brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nuts, coupled with an appreciation of the natural things of life, like caring about children and his girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with a subtle perfection. He may be considerate ("You just crossed the field for me!") And be blindly blinded by his love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel? A little spongy?") At the same time . Fallon's portrait "makes" the film. Let's hope this film marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something that goes beyond the absolute sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (ie Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In short, a film that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male and female characters who have exceeded this limit and provided flawless humor lines, most of them delivered with a subtle subtlety by Fallon. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw that with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved him as much as me. This is neither a "Guy Flick" nor a "Chick Flick". It's a fantastic makeup film. Go see him!
