THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the hilarious adaptation in 1975 of Neil Simon's play on a retired vaudevillian team, performed by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter break and were invited to meet once again. more for a special television show or something else. . The problem is that the two men always hate each other and do not want to have anything to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as the nephew of Matthau, a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this meeting a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a beautiful valentine for a forgotten entertainment ... vaudeville and works primarily thanks to one of Neil Simon's best scripts and the remarkable work of Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for that, but I think Matthau is leaving with this film with his hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthau has been nominated for Best Actor but has no chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST; however, another year was a performance worthy of an Oscar. Matthau controls the screen and there is no wrong note in this superbly timed performance. The scene where he is auditioning for an advertisement on potato chips and can not get the name of the product is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning comedy by Neil Simon that shines with unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
