I first bought this movie on VHS that I just had to buy it on DVD, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book, but I really think the movie is a lot better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam because Mr. Knightley was a great choice. He was brilliant! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
