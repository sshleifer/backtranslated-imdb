Police Story is a great series of plays allowing Jackie Chan to show off her talents and courage. Some of the waterfalls here are some of Jackie's best and most dangerous. The whole bout of the fight at the mall is probably Jackie's finest fight sequence, more brutal and less comical than Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight, you can almost feel the pain of impact. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, the rest of the film does not stand up to this quality because it is a rather formal crime thriller with some comedy elements. I always prefer JC in films such as Project A, where his natural comic talents shine through. In the serious confines of some Police Story elements, it just does not work for me. That said, even though it's still one of Jackies' best films because of his incredible stunt work and his amazing show. <br /> <br /> As usual with Hong Kong movies, avoid the English version dubbed on DVD because it is really horrible. subtitles. <br /> <br /> Excellent stunts, movie OK, a good starting point if you've never seen a JC movie and deserves a visit by all movie fans 7/10
