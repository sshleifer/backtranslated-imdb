Telemundo should definitely consider creating a DVD collection of the novela Xica! I know tons of people, including myself, who would like to buy Novela Xica! It is a very entertaining novela that takes place in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city in which the novela takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of this period. I would like Telemundo to televise again, even though it was 2 o'clock in the morning. I would highly recommend watching Xica if it happens again on Telemundo. I have already sent a million times by e-mail to Telemundo to show him the novela again, but my requests fell on deaf ears. The only caveat about Xica is that it sometimes contains difficult scenes, so I would recommend to children under 14 not to watch Xica. Overall, Xica deserves a 10 out of 10!
