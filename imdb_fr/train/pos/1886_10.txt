I love this movie since its debut in 1981! I forgot how many times I saw it! He never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if I feel depressed. The three tracks are fantastic and the scenario is priceless. How not to be nostalgic to hear the theme? I think I'm quoting this film without realizing it. I basically know the script in its entirety. Therefore, when someone looks at it for the first time, I have to stop myself from saying something about the funny of the next line. I can not even say it, although Sir John's character probably gets the most memorable. The famous "I'm going to alert the media" when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath is priceless, but the list is really endless. The scene at Arthur's soon to be the home of the fiance's father is a cry, especially his interactions with moose. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!
