For those who wanted to know exactly how humanity had come to hide in big red pods that made me want to make grenades, here is the duet of the shorts "Second Renaissance". I do not know exactly why they are divided into two parts, especially since they are credited as one on the DVD (and these shorts are they seen in another format than the DVD?), But they are informative even if they have some gaps. <br /> <br /> What really distinguishes this first part, the second part as well as the rest of the animations, is the parallel that shows between the uprising of robots and civil rights. Graphic tributes to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are associated with verbal references to the Million Man March and the divine complex of humanity. In fact, these short films never really refer to "God", they are replaced by "the image of the man". <br /> <br /> As for the short films in the collection, "The second rebirth, first part" is by far the most effective way to bring out the emotion. It is a painful and disturbing vision of humanity's potential to become "the architect of its own destruction". Some concepts may be thwarted by some of the concepts in this short excerpt from the established science fiction literature, but again, that's essentially what most Matrix series have done, and that's what motivated its success. <Br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
