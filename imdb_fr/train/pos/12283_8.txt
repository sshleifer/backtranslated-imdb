The photograph of this bid-budgeted production is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brownish and the photography is very neat. The production and editing are often quite simple and look like TV movies. * And * at the beginning, the film only seems to want to torture its audience with dark images of sex and violence. The score of Hans Zimmer is also a typically simple and bland work of this surrealist composer without talent. <br /> <br /> But if you want to watch the movie further, you are rewarded with a very moving family story, a kind of epic giant version of Edna Ferber's family. While at first you wonder why Clara married this silly man, even his character acquires more depth and more depth to judge him. Clara delivers the film's spiritual lesson, a moving and moving statement against the terrible events unfolding in her country. His daughter, whose anime is Antonio Banderas early in his international career, understands this lesson and tries to live it. The way the plot was built with the ending reflecting the beginning was excellent. The actors all do a great job too. I was wondering "Who is the actress who plays Blanca?" All the time, but of course, it was a very young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> In the end, this film really made me want to read the book.
