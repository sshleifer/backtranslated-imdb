This is the first movie I saw last year! It's awfully funny, incredibly original, incredibly beautiful (they opted for that super-cool technicolor look that's awesome to see) and it actually has depth in character and in what it says on the society. It's a really smart satire that covers everything from homeland security to race issues, while letting you laugh and realizing how scary life is in the world. Carrie Anne Moss turns in a comic performance that I never imagined coming from her! She is sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as a Fido who can only groan and moan! And Dylan Baker as a dad is priceless. In fact, the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as a villain, Tim Blake Nelson as a sexy and sexy zombie girlfriend neighbor (you get the idea now?) It's funny, provoking and just amazing! Check out this movie! It does not look like anything you've seen before.
