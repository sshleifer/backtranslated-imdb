When I was a child, I loved computer animation even though it was extremely limited and the tools were almost non-existent. This film, as I watched the amazing images and the almost hypnotic music, shaped my desire to create moving things in the computer. This is a global contract, between music and video, that really gives a shot. If you know a kid who wants to get involved in a computer animation, it's a MUST HAVE. <br /> <br /> Nearly 20 years later, I still consider this film one of my three favorites. I think originality has still not been overtaken by most of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits. I am currently trying to find out if I can do it myself; if the imitation is the most sincere flattery, then this film deserves a ton of imitation =)
