OK, I slightly overestimated it to compensate for at least one of those grumpy criticisms. But I liked it. I did not burst out laughing, but it held my interest and trained me without letting me down at any time. The story built. Yeah, you knew it would have a happy ending - that kind always has. In the meantime, it was weird with visual gags that you might miss, so be careful when you look. Stiller and Black delivered again with expertise. Good team. They should work more together. I did not know it would be a cult classic, but it was certainly a fun ride. Not as good as ABOUT BOB, or SOUNDRIGES ROTTENES, but what is it? It's always worth going out of your way to watch and watch this movie.
