"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime of Rumiko Takahashi, this woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, it is not only a comedy, but also an action anime.The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome A teenager who is also a martial arts expert Ranma is betrothed to Akane because of an arrangement of the two fathers, who are great friends and have been training together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the youngest and most violent sister of Tendo: Kasumi is the oldest and is very kind and Nabiki is in the center and likes to make money, anyway. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane are fighting all the time, especially because both have a very bad and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when she is splashed with cold water and that her father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations are starting to happen, they are discovering also the reason for the transformation: during the fight, Ranma and his father fell into a cursed river. But it's not just them who have had this kind of destiny ... <If you looked at '' Ranma 1/2 '' and liked it, I would also recommend '' Inuyasha '' and '' House Ikkoku ", two other good creations from Rumiko's hands.
