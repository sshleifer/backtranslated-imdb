A beautiful shorts Shirely Temple. The children actors shouting their lines seemed to be the norm for this day and this hour. Perhaps it was "to be seen and not to hear". Apart from that, it's fun. From the point of view of the cinema, certain aspects of the thing, from a social point of view, seem to me very progressive and liberal. I will not go into those, I would rather not spoil it for you, but let you look at it yourself and see if you spot those elements. From this short film, it was easy to see the fascination that was already developing for Temple. It is worth watching if you are a fan of Temple. For others, it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your glass of good night's milk to warm up on fire.
