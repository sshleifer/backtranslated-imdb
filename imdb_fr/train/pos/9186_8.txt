Adrien Wilde, a photographer for troubled men's magazines (well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan), has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murdered his models. When the beautiful ladies begin to be dead for real, Adrien fears he is the killer. Screenwriter / director William Byron Hillman tells the captivating story at a steady pace, creates reasonable tension, delivers some terribly effective moments of fierce misogynist violence (a woman who placed a plastic garbage bag on her head emphasizes refreshing on loyal and endearing characters, faithful to reality, animates everything in a plausible world of everyday life and overcomes everything with a beautiful nuance of tasty feminine nudity. excellent casting helps a lot: Joanna Pettet as sunny, a charming lover: Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as the macho twin amputee brother of Adrien, Seymour Cassel as anxious psychiatrist Adrien, Dr. Frank Curtis, and Don Potter as the feisty Adrien's Gay Assistant Louis, Pamela Hensley, as Detective of the Brave Homicide, Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as Police Chief The intransigent, and Misty Rowe, the sweet and bubbly Bambi. Refined cinematography by R. Michael Stringer impressively uses breathtaking panoramic shots. Jack Goga's sinister score is also good. Robert Tessier is a pretentious bartender, Sally Kirkland, a sassy whore, Kathy Shower, a fierce wrestler with whom B. is struggling, and Frances Bay, one of her old woman roles. A solid and pleasant image.
