An imagination is a terrible thing to lose ... especially when you have talented actors. Screenwriter / director Jones does not waste time dealing with the viewer with his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Everyone who shared an apartment with a slob will cry out laughing. Anyone who has arrived while a maid on the meter places a ticket on your windshield will just cry. We all wanted to tear a terrible toupee off a man's head. These are just excerpts of what awaits us as we watch "Cross Eyed", a heartfelt film that should serve as a springboard for Jones and his twisted sense of humor in front of and behind the camera.
