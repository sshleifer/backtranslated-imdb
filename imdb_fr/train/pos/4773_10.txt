Nice piece of good cinema. It's one of those movies you see smiling and you do not know why. One of the reasons may be that we are in front of one of today's most surprising filmmakers and he is able to film emotions. <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie, you can feel what Mr. Straight was. Feeling when he made the decision to go visit his brother with his "wonderful" John Deere. What has changed in his mind? What has changed in YOUR mind when you watched this movie? <br /> <br /> A beautiful story of fraternal love.
