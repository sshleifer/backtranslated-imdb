This was the second time in the regular Columbo series, and it stands up well today. As I am able to watch this closely on DVD and see how it is built, I am very impressed by the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who directed the film MACHO CALLAHAN and countless TV episodes). the actions of the murderer after the murder are shown on a split screen on his two glasses, look at how the murder itself is shown as a montage, look at the point of view from the cadaver's point of view. In addition, the wild but impressive avant-garde musical score of renowned jazzman Gil Melle was incredible and helped a lot to create an atmosphere. And Brett Halsey's performance as a golf pro was fantastic - such subtlety and complexity in a role that would be nine times out of ten would be a one-dimensional cut. The "formula" had not been defined yet when shooting this episode. So there are some surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the actors of the highest quality and it is a pleasure to see them work. All men know many other roles but get lost in their characters here. All in all, this entry in the Columbo series - and MUCH of the others - is as well made as a very good feature film.
