I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue upside down - and yet I'm drawn to it many times. <br /> <br /> Located in Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the eligible single "Kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of the innocent "Klara" Margaret Sullavan. Kralik secretly becomes Klara's friend, and at work Klara confides in Kralik about the content of her letters (de Kralik). It is clear that Kralik is fascinated by Klara - but he is unable to make known his feelings while he is competing with the "pen-friend". Confused? Well you will not do it - this story has a sweet end, almost sweet - but we all know it's the end we all want. <br /> <br /> Other characters to note are Frank Morgan who plays his usual role, this time the owner of the store "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart in the role of "Pirovitch", the confidant of Kralik . Joseph Schildkraut as arrogant and arrogant "Vadas" - so well played that you can not stop him from hating him from the start. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy who manages to be loved by us with his overconfident confidence of a junior store "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently reconfigured in "You've Got Mail" with Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me, it's not as good as the original - although I suspect a younger audience I would not disagree. <br /> <br /> If this film is broadcast in your area at Christmas, I suggest you serve a good glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex.
