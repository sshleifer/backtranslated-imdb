This movie was very funny, I could not help but smile looking at this and had already watched it twice in two days! The film is distinctly unique in its humor and graphics. Both are great and equal with the other jewels of Natali's film (more serious), Cube and Cypher. I have become a big fan of Vincenzo Natali since I look at Cypher and all he has done is very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of sympathy with the music and the "losers" of Dave and Andrew, played by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), actors that I really like both. The X-Box Dead Or Alive fights (you can even see Dave playing Halo at one point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among others, are also interesting. <br /> <br /> In short, a great movie that feels good. about friendship. You must see that!
