One of my favorite episodes of Twilight Zone. And the next day we were at the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who was coming towards us in the driveway! Barney Phillips, but no hat - at least I do not think he has one. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye and he said something as if he had left it at home, and all those he met that day the had questioned about it. <br /> <br /> A nice guy. We used to see all kinds of character actors in Los Angeles at that time. <br /> <br /> By the way, I was a teenager and it took me a long time to overcome the "three hands" of the other alien! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Native of Hollywood and resident of 1947 to 1963.
