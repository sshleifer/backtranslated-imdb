The first von Trier film I have ever seen broke the waves. Of course, a good movie, but it stays in the shadow of Europe. Europa tells the story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the Second World War. He takes a job that his uncle reserved for him as a steward on a luxury train. Because of his work, he travels a Germany almost completely destroyed, meets the murder of traitors and hunts former members of the Nazi party. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle reduced his conscience by focusing on the work he also does as a commissioner on the train. Coincidentally, the main character got involved in bombings and terrorism from a group called "werewolves", who lobbied him to help them place bombs in trains. The atmosphere is incredible. The spectator is taken from stage to stage by a man who tries to put him under hypnosis and then counts to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe ïƒ— !!
