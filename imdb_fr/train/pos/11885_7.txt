This film, made for French television, deals with the tragic effect it has on a very close family. When we diagnose the AIDS virus in Leo, the young man at the center of the story, the announcement to his parents, they just can not believe it. The film is a character study of how this family treats its subject. <br /> <br /> We congratulate the director, Christophe Honor√©, for bringing this candid account to the screen. Nowhere in France, this story could be presented to the cinema because of the subject treated. <br /> <br /> The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the younger brother who learns what Leo has contracted, despite the parents want to protect him from reality. <br /> <br /> Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in describing the brothers.
