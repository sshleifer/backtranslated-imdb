Yesterday, I watched this film for the third time. It was recommended to me by a fried several weeks ago. I had never looked at it or even noticed it before, because it falls (so typically) in the category "Swedish Film" and those who have stood up (like me) with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical about foreign films. Hell, what a paradigm shift! The film touches me, because it only feeds my hope, that humanity can change to be better. The Swedish village is just a model for all parts of the world where people live side by side - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised brutality, but also the ability to have fun, to meet, to sing ... It takes a trigger from the outside to tear everyone's masks (who keeps one) and make them feel that we are all human beings who want to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing stories like this, because it supports my hope as described above. The five minutes that contain the story of Gabriella's song, including her performance, are one of my best moments of all time! Thank you Kay Pollak just for those 5 minutes, which made me happy!
