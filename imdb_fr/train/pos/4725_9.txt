Despite the lack of logic of the scenario, Kill Shot is an extremely enjoyable movie. Through a moving performance, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly describes the emotional divide between a rich and hard-working father and his lost son. Each member of the secondary cast brings a solid performance, highlighted by the lively play of a young Asian man whose name I do not remember. A shocking and tragic end may upset some younger viewers, but overall, Kill Shot is truly a deadly blow.
