Alain Delon is quick to revenge the family of the ruthless crime that has used it as a great success in the thriller "Big Guns" Duccio Tessari after the accidental murder of his wife and child. Tessari and the writers Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of "One minute to pray, one second to die", and Franco Verucci of "Ring of Death" evoke this actor about a career shooter for the crowd, to the end . Indeed, "Big Guns" is rather predictable, but it remains qualified solid entertainment with many wild and often sudden murders. Alain Delon of "The Godson" is rightly laconic because he methodically deals with the death of the heads of the families of the crowd who refused to let him retire in order to enjoy life with his young son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" plays the role of a Sicilian crime leader who wants to bury the hatchet with the character of Delon, but the rest of his hard-nosed associates want death. Like most thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" subscribed to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay. Interestingly, the only man who has nothing to do with the murder of the hero's wife and son survives, while another betrays the hero with extreme bias. Tessari does not waste a second in this 90-minute shoot'em up. Aside from the death of the mother and son in a car bomb destined for the father, the worst thing that happens is happening in a car recovery yard when a hero associate is crushed in a ransacked car. Apparently, "Big Guns" is a rather bloody exit, but it has a lot of bodies for a gangster melodrama of 1973. It is only at the last minute that our protagonist drops his guard and the artificial morality of the eye for eye remains intact. Tessari stages a few car chases and the death of a man on a train in a railway tunnel is as bloody as this violent wire ignites. The photography and the compositions are excellent.
