Dark Remains is a simple home run. The film is full of frightening visuals and scares that will blow the veteran of the most seasoned horror right away. The stairs scene in particular, these guys are good. Although they do not work with a huge budget, everything seems to be going well and the actors are doing it. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive endings that may be negative for some, but I guess that makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are perfectly placed for the mourning couple who are trying to rebuild their lives, "but some secondary characters like the Sheriff did not convince me. In any case, they are not so important. I give Dark Remains a rating of ten to be ten times more scary than any recent ghost / remake studio story.
