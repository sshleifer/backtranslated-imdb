Dan Katzir has produced a magnificent film that takes us on a real roller coaster through a true love story unfolding in the troubles of modern Israel. <br /> <br /> For all lovers, the film brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and the heartache that make love so bitterly sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that reigned during the difficult time in Israel at that time only intensifies sentiment. Instantly, you are engrossed in Dan's fate and you can not fail to be deeply moved. <br /> <br /> You can not write a drama and a passion like these: the contrast between the realities of Dan, desperate, grasped the relationship with Iris and the realities of a state in crisis make it eminently observable. If you have an ounce of passion and have already been in love, watch this movie.
