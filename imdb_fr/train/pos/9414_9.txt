Although most Americans know very little of his work, with the exception of Star Wars, Alec Guinness has produced an impressive amount of work - especially in the 1940s-1950s - from dramas to original comedies. . I particularly like his comedies, because they are so well made and seem so natural and real on the screen - very different from the usual Hollywood price. <br /> <br /> That being said, this film has sparked my interest for these films. The plot was so strange and cute that it was very unlikely that the film was shot anywhere other than in Ealing Studios, which particularly liked "little" movies like this one. <br /> Guinness is a nerdy little scientist who works for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create an indestructible synthetic fabric, although he does not work for society as a researcher, but for housekeeping! Thus, he tends to sneak into the laboratories (the day if no one suspects it, or at night) and try to invent it. On several occasions, he is caught (as after having exploded the lab) and kicked until the day he succeeds! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, it triggers a series of totally unexpected events, then the entertainment begins. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful satire that makes fun of industry, unions, government and people in general.
