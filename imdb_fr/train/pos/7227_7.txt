Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the replicas he interprets are good and give him a chance to get away from the drunken stupor. The charming Susannah York is a good stratagem for O'Toole's dramatic presence. <br /> <br /> The film alludes to incest - without a single explicit scene - but it is able to entertain the viewer in its noisy social commentary. Although this is not a major film, in any case, he will be remembered for his entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding the tragedy in silence. The possible weakness here is Thompson's casual leadership. But the film floats because of the actors and the scenario. <br /> <br /> I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years - both times under the name "brotherly love". "Country Dance" is a rather ridiculous and inappropriate title for this movie, no matter where it was released.
