Although this film has weaknesses, it is worth seeing. I chose it because of the distribution, and I applaud Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing different roles than they have in the past. Both represent very troubled people, with warts, but make them friendly because of their humanity. The story is touching, but performance is skyrocketing. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement, whose quest for romance has opened my eyes to aspects of disability that I had not thought of before, but that were also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended too abruptly, but it was better than finishing a long emotional manipulative end (see "My mother-in-law.").
