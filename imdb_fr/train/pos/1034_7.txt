I think this film was probably a lot more powerful when it debuted in 1943, even though nowadays it seems a little too predatory and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940 - just before the United States entered the war. Paul Lukas is the serious and honest leader of his family. It is a German who spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding being captured. Bette Davis is his very understanding and suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise children without him from time to time. At the beginning of the film, they cross the Mexican border in the United States and, for the first time in years, they will relax and stop running. The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent - making them an obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family with real problems. While this had a very noble purpose at the time, it just seems wrong today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by the children did not sound right. It was more like antifascist speeches than real children's voices. As a result, they were extremely annoying - especially the little one who sometimes presented himself as a kid. Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the foolish Romanian living with them (though he has no noticeable accent) were pretty much the only real ones that seemed true. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe the famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog box because it simply does not sound true to reality. The story was based on the play of her lover, Lillian Hellman. And the basic idea and the plot are good, but the dialogue is sometimes bad. Overall, an interesting curiosity and a movie with great moments, ... but that's about it.
