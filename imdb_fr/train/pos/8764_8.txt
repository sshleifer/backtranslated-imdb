Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been better friends forever and decide, once they graduate, to get a trip to Thailand. Due to an incident, they meet a mysterious and attractive young foreigner who invites them to accompany him to Hong Kong for the weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are confused with the heroine of drug trafficking and they are sent to jail. The time has now come for ultimate survival and true friendship. It was a very good movie, I have seen it many times and after a while, you will notice that they are a few holes in the plot, but the film still keeps you entertained. Claire Danes did a great job as usual, she is an excellent actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
