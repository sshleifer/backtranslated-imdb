Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she is attracted to her perfectly normal neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces her to drop her fiance and fall in love with her. Things are going pretty well until Gillian finds out that she really cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell him his secret. But how's Shep going to react when he finds out that he's been "trapped" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As for the light comedies of the 1950s, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. This is a pretty nice watch and should please almost everyone who is sitting with her. Just do not go into the movie hoping for the best thing since the sliced ​​bread. The film is cute, funny sometimes and touching at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks rather incredible in a discreet way. The cast of Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often funny to laugh and steals a lot of spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can not really decide what kind of movie they want to be. Is it a ball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If the director Richard Quine had opted for a single approach, the film could have been even better and more memorable.
