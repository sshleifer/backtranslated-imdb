"Show People" is an absolutely delightful silence directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What is precious in this charming comedy about a girl, Peggy Pepper, whose role is to talk about Savannah trying to get to the big screen. Although she succeeds in comedy, what she wants to do is make "art", so she moves to the High Arts Studio. Soon she will become Patricia PÃ©poire and become too beautiful for her friend Billy. <br /> <br /> Many Silence-era stars have cameos in "Show People", including Davies herself without hair or makeup. I'm sure when people saw the movie in 1928, they recognized everyone who participated in the elaborate lunch scene. Unfortunately, nowadays, this is not the case, even for moviegoers. In one part of the film, however, she meets Charlie Chaplin; in another example, the author Elinor Glyn is reported to him and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many other artists are among the stars of this show. <br /> <br /> Davies was adorable and an animated comedian. It's a pity that William Haines left the cinema - he was cute and energetic, rightly a huge star at the time. <br /> <br /> "Show People" is a simple story told with humor. It's also a look back on an exciting time in Hollywood history and contains the performances of two wonderful stars.
