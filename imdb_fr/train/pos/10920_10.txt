I remember seeing this movie when I was a child. I do not remember where I saw him. I must have been around 14 years old. I thought the movie was amazing and wanted to see it again. It happened once on the Kung Fu chain, but I missed it. I was really disgusted. It's the best Kung Fu special effects movie I've seen so far! I highly recommend it, and now that I've discovered where to get it, I can enjoy it again and for years to come. I must also watch this movie The return of venom that some have talked about so much.
