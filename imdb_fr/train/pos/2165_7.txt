See "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable films are a rarity, when one comes as "Impulse", it's something to embrace. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible performances. It might have looked like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any annoying "zombiefest", and originality shines through almost every scene. You have the feeling that something like this could have happened, even if the script is pure fiction. From the opening of the "grabber" to the credits, you will be fascinated. Very fun and definitely recommended. - MERK
