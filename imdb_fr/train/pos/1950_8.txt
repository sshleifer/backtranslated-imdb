Diane Keaton has played some "heavy" roles in her many years on the big screen, but she is best known for her "light and fluffy" films with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and no matter the competition, regardless of the year it was presented. Try to find a scene in which she does not appear. And it was a heavy drama, exhausting in its rhythm and which takes again, the action, all at full speed. Makeup made her as young as possible and she was in the 30-year-old category even in close-up, but she was playing at half age and at a very fast pace. The film, overall, was quite well done, staged, and well shot with a solid cast of support, but Keaton carried the charge.
