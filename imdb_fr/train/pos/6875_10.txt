When I was president of our college cafe, one of our tasks was to examine groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to come in 1972 was Groove Tube. The starting point was that Broadway was screened in theaters where television screens were installed among the public, so that everyone had a good place. The principle was that the skits would change regularly, like Saturday Night Live, to keep cool. They decided to make a film for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I think the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was shooting in a movie. Watch him run naked, even though the wood was a howl. Like a lot of critics before mine, it was Saturday Night Live before it happened. I highly recommend this vid. I talked about Koko the clown to my 13 year old son. He can not wait to get a copy!
