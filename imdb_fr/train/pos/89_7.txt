To be honest, I did not know at all what this movie looked like when I started it. That's how I watch movies whenever possible. No preconception. I thought it was going to be a movie about nails in the woods or something. I was wrong, a little. <br /> <br /> Loaded was pretty boring at first, but once it started, it really made me addicted. I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless, but doing things you do not want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented that this movie was stupid and implausible, but please postpone. This kind of thing happens. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing serious can happen and crazy situations are "unlikely". Really sorry but the reality of the WORLD is that they happen. The creator of this film as well as the actors did a great job in describing how things can go wrong and how people can make very bad choices. Sometimes things go well, sometimes they become bad and that is life. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
