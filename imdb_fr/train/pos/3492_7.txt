This movie is not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> It has a good distribution. It's nice to see Roger Moore come back to the screen and use other British actors. <br /> <br /> Would like to see more Olivia D'Abo in her future projects.May be in the company of her cousin the sexy Maryam D`Abo. <br /> <br /> A good use also of invisible places such as Luxembourg. <BR /> <br /> Let's hope we'll see more British and European co-productions like this one.
