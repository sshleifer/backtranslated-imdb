Peter Jacksons version (s) are better films globally from an objective point of view. That being said, these are not my favorite versions of Lord Of The Rings on the screen and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First, the game of characters on the screen is too ordinary and uninteresting with Jackson's LOTR. The whole distribution is too common. "Are you saying that those stupid cartoon characters in Ralph Bakshi's version are better actors than real people?" we could ask. Well, they're not really stupid (except for the Hobbits, later for them) and they certainly have more personality than Jackson's party - even with a much more limited amount of dialogue. And that's because of the superiority of Bakshi's LOTR voice. Take Aragorn for example. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic, imprinted with authority (Aragorn the Lord) and a seasoned rasp (Aragorn the ranger). This is due to the brilliant interpretation of John Hurt. Compare that with the rather high-pitched, soulless Viggo Mortensen, and the duel quickly becomes uneven: Hurt beats Mortensen hands down. <br /> <br /> And then there is Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the entire saga. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf (William Squire) is a true magician. And by that, I do not mean that he pulls bolts with his fingertips (he does not do it), but his presence is simply captivating. He is a mystic, powerful and can easily go from the sweet old man to a scary person. Add to that his looks: tall, old like old oak, long beard like his body, sharp eyes, crooked witch's nose and of course, the classic wizard's hat. A perfect Gandalf, as in books. Gandalf by Ian McKellen, on the other hand, is just too boring. He looks too human, seems too human, acts too human, and wears neither hat nor weapon. Yes a sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf kills two or three bloody orcs with his sword (as he did in the books). And these are elegant kills in slow motion. Gandalf is not a power with which one must play. And it must be noted that even though I am sad to say, the great Christopher Lee did not give life to Saruman. In this film, Fraser Kerr did it, even with a time and very limited screen lines. <br /> <br /> Before turning completely to the visual aspects of the film, it is worth mentioning that the voice play and the general presentation of the Orcs are also superior to Jackson's so-called mean villains. Bakshi's orcs mock their enemies (or each other) constantly with grunts, cries and nasty language. They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion. And finally, the black horsemen - or the Nazgul. The ultimate villains are scary ghosts in this one - not just some runners wearing black. And they speak with a haunting voice, mesmerizing their victim. My favorite scene in the movie is when the Nazgul chase Frodo near the river. While Peter Jackson could do nothing but show the riders to simply drive the party off, Bakshi is immersed in a nightmarish dream with cool idle scenes and a stormy sky. <br /> <br /> But I love this film as Jackson's, they are, even if technically, even better. And it's because of some key visuals. As you know, Bakshi LOTR presents a mix of animated characters (all hobbits and main cast) and real actors covered with paint. I do not really have a problem using real people in animation in this way, but they just do not fit well with traditional cartoon characters. This is especially true with humans (Rohan Riders, Tavern People, etc.) Orcs are a different affair because they are supposed to have a very distinctive look from other characters. Orcs, although played by humans with an animation mix, seem far superior to Jacksons' version. They have brownish green skin, bright red eyes, flat faces and sharp teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in the visuals of this film is the Hobbits. Although I prefer almost all the characters of the Bakshi version to those of Jackson, the latter clearly has higher Hobbits, but they are perfect. With Bakshi, you get irritating and poorly drawn Disney humanoid bamboos. And you have to spend a lot of time in the movies with them, so be warned. Again, the dubbing is acceptable for them too, but the actors' mouths can not save the "immersion damage" caused by these small weasels. Anyway, I never really liked these halflings. <br /> <br /> The general failures of the Bakshi script are well known. Limited playing time (with limited budget) and a lot of missing scenes. So, although this film covers almost half of the story, it does not have much detail compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> In summary, Ralph Bakshi's version of LOTR has a superior atmosphere: <br /> <br /> - a global atmosphere (it's like being closer to Middle Earth) - a voice overall - a music (I dig the fantastic score of Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (one of the most beautiful roles of John Hurt) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (This is not a hippie of fairy in this one!) <br /> <br /> While Jackson's version is better: <br /> <br /> -because it covers the whole story -visuals and special effects- Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, despite his well-known faults, is one of the best animated films ever made and he captures very well, if not perfectly, the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world. I'll give it a score of 8Â½ out of 10.
