It sounds more like a psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho sounds better as a header. The director of the film (the narrator if you want) describes the movies here in his own way. Most of them are classics, but they are all listed here at IMDb and I would strongly advise you to see them (especially the Hitchcock, Solyaris, Conversation and Lynch movies), as Slavoj Zizek will refer them! <br /> <br /> Or in other words, he could spoil them for you. I do not remember if he spoiled more than the ones I listed (I'm also thinking of Chaplin's movies), but as I wrote, it would be better if you watched them all in advance! In the IMDb list, I miss a movie that I reported to them, which could very well do it very soon. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a short excerpt, no big deal at all. <br /> <br /> The views and opinions of Zizek are crazy and fun to listen to, if you are open minded another perspective (even if it destroys your favorite movie a little bit for you ... that does not mean to say that it will do it, but it could do it)!
