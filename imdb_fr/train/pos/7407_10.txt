This film took me by surprise. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. This film has presented many truths. I also like all the characters in this movie. This film makes a lot of sense because as society "progresses more and more", what does culture lose? Do not appear predatory. I can really understand this movie from my childhood and lose my life that will never come back or that has never been the same. This film is in my top 5 movies I've ever watched. There is a truth so raw that I feel when I watch the movie and it's not the kind of truth you have to dig to see it in front of your face. The creators of this movie did a great job and I really enjoyed this movie. This film may not be for everyone but if you have an open mind, I think you will love it.
