I just watched this Japanese feature film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. the film actually shows the outside world how the rigid structures of the family, of employment (employee) and recreation still exist in Japan today. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter / Director Suo Masauki [I am Japanese customary to introduce last name (last name) first and last name (last)] uses unpopular theme of dance to show the structure of Japanese society. <br /> <br /> [By the way, I will not use film character names when readers around the world may not be familiar with the Japanese official names that can be confusing. I will refer to the actors <br /> <br /> by their professional actor name, as indicated in the database on the Internet. <br /> <br /> He calls for the help of his wife , his professional ballet the dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in his first and so far only a film. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. Yet her true ambition is to compete once again in an international dance competition she was disqualified from in the past. No, I will not say "why". Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the star of the movie. Veteran of almost 25 films since 1979, he brilliantly interprets a 40s company <br /> <br /> who has a charming wife, a teenage girl, and has just bought his friend's house <br /> <br /> ardent desire. <br /> <br /> And yet, something is missing from his own inner happiness. Watch this film to learn how he "gets involved" in ballroom dancing and secretly goes to <br /> <br /> lessons. Most dancing characters are released from the traditional Japanese <br /> <br /> hierarchy of social structures. They are friendly and warm and inviting. Of course, this contrasts with the structure of Japanese society and its philosophy of "place for everyone in its place". <br /> <br /> The film has so many fun moments. Nearly 1500 spectators dropped <br /> in a spontaneous burst of laughter during many comic moments. This proves <br /> <br /> that comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> The veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant, as well as Watanabe Eriko. They are two actors of funny characters. <br /> <br /> One can buy and read a college textbook on the structure of life in Japan, or watch this film and begin to understand how <br /> <br /> Japanese people grow up in a corporate structure quite rigid. Looking at the movie "Shall we dance?" is a quick immersion in further studies and visualization of other Japanese <br /> films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's charming, it will make you cry a little and it will warm your heart. <br /> <br />
