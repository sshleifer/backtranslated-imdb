I saw this movie on DVD yesterday and he was stunned. The unrestricted game of DDL just cut my mind, and I was surprised by the whole cast and by its superb role. All the characters were so authentic to me, I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for her mother. Go see him! You will cry your heart, but you will experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you an important lesson: determination is everything. You may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but you do not have a problem when you are stubborn enough. If you can only use your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing to do in case of a mental challenge is to feel sorry for yourself. It will not get you anywhere and the only person who will have pity on you will be yourself.
