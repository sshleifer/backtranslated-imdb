When I started watching "Fay Grim", I did not know it was a sequel to "Henry Fool". However, the latter was not a film that I envisioned having a sequel. But we have arrived, and it's pretty good. I suppose you saw the original, so I will not explain it. This one starts with Fay (Parker Posey) who lives with her son that she had with Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan), a bad thing. Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day, the son is deported for bringing a pornographic toy to school. But it's not an ordinary toy. This is a secret that largely explains what happened in the first movie. And this secret goes deeper into geopolitics than "Syriana". <br /> <br /> I must say that I am quite impressed by what Hal Hartley has accomplished here. Maybe this one does not quite reach the quality of the original, but you have to look at what is happening in the world. And the end leaves open the possibility of another sequel. <br /> <br /> Featured with Jeff Goldblum.
