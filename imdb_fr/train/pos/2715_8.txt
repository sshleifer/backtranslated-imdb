Q.E.D. It was a brilliant TV series and it was really one of the few projects that deserved to be programmed! I think that in this era of TIVO and recording devices, it would be much better than in 1982. I look forward to its availability on DVD! with other TV shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., of which I am a big fan, QED had a much more intellectual quality to it. However, it did not suffer for that - the dialogue was spiritual and the action was intense. The series was broadcast in the UK under the pseudonym Mastermind, and it had something similar to the BBC, but with better production values ​​than the BBC had generally at that time. <br /> <br /> This series started early and had too much to do in my life to take the time to watch. I remember, however, that my dear mother called me to remind me that Q.E.D. was on and we sat on the phone and watched the movie together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> In truth, Q.E.D. It's a sad loss, and if it could be done with the same quality and values ​​today, I'd love to see him make a comeback.
