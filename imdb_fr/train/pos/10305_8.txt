If you want to laugh seriously, watch this movie and the things Bruce inflicts on his comrade. Deleted scenes are priceless. I do not know why they did not include them in the original movie. It can not be because of the weather, because the movie lasts only 101 minutes. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, too long neglected. Jim Carrey needs medicine!
