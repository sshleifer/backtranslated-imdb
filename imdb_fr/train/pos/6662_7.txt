Gandhi my father is a well done movie. He nicely describes the life of Gandhiji's eldest son Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand alone, his failure, his ego. Akshaye Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. But not him, everyone did well. Darshan Jariwala is the best on-screen Gandhiji I have ever seen. But I will cut three points because there were few gaps. <br /> <br /> First, the film lasted fifteen to twenty minutes longer than it should have. Secondly, the film required more research on the character of Harilal. Somehow, the character seemed incomplete. In addition, his relationship with his brothers has not been shown. There was no mention of another Gandhiji child in the whole movie. I think the character like Harilal should also have at least some differences with his brothers, given the selfish nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite the flaws, I liked the movie.
