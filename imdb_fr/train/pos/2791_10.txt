This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind), there are only movies like The Lord of the Rings, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home series. <br /> I can really understand the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film, she's a shy girl with a strange background, who has a lot more friends than girls than boys. She really sucks you in her life. I certainly can not blame either the role of the protagonist or any other actor in the film. <br /> <br /> Football was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of ​​the rules. The film is never boring. The romance is really cute and did not make me blush too hard! However, the Indian factor made the difference. Jess's parents are Indian and there are many very colorful Indian conventions in the film, offering a very interesting cultural overview, as well as everything else. Indians are hilarious! It's basically an adult movie about choosing the path you want and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> Feel Good is becoming my favorite movie genre with this movie. They are funny, refreshing and they make you feel good! ^ _ ~
