I caught this on the plate last night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 times (adopting our 2 children). I can not understand exactly why I liked this movie, except to see "bad" turn "good" and "good" turn "semi-bad". I liked the look that Ben Chaplin had throughout the film. Like "I can not believe it's happening to me", whether it's good or bad, it looks the same (and works). Great end. 7/10. Praise him or catch him as I did.
