If you, like me, have a close and long relationship with the world of Tintin, do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life, which created Tintin. It's so great and a very cool production. All the background story about Hergé and its inhabitants, but also the many situations in which he has been influenced, for better or for worse, is incredible. There is a very close and obvious connection between comics and that. I will of course be in my basement to find the albums of Tintin. In addition, the film itself is very well said and has a great ambient sound. I really hope people will find this as intriguing as me!
