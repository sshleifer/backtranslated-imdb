I'll always have a thing for this Disney movie, another of their action / live action movie that was looking to replicate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never did. When I was in elementary school, we occasionally organized a movie day where the whole school gathered in the cafeteria and where a film was projected in the old fashioned way, with several reels and everything else. At the time, it was a memorable occasion every time that day came and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies I remember well. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's really charming. . Angela Lansbury never gave her name to a title that was not at least competent, and she wins here as a magic bed witch (boy, who could be misinterpreted, no?) Who could take her with a young couple children in magical adventures in far away places. Come on, what kid would not want a bed like that? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
