Like the great giants that make up the second half of the title, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and heavy. The last output of the producer, "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they did it. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy is his passable animatronix, which is always fun when it comes to wonderful worlds beneath the surface of the ocean. But even that was only passable. The lack of concentration in some scenes has made amateur production. With dolphins and whales, technology is all but wasted. Cloudy scenes and too close-ups of the film's giant subjects do not make it possible to exploit the superb 3D capabilities of IMAX. There are far too few scenes of depth and variety. The close-ups of these incredible creatures look flat and there is often only one creature in the camera field, so there is no depth contrast. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow in his father's footsteps, but when Shark-Week is broadcast on cable, his introspective and boring treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
