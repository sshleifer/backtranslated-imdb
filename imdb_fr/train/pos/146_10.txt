I arrived at the end of my sentence and I almost shouted: "No, no, no, no! It can not stop there! There are too many unanswered questions! The engagement of the dishwashers? The disappearance of Mona ? The success of Helmer? The "zombie"? Was little brother saved by his father? And the head ???????? ARGH !! Then I read that at least two of the cast members were dead and I must say, I know it probably would not be in line with Lars von Trier's vision, but I would gladly look at the replacement actors just to see the end he had planned! Certainly, it would be difficult to find someone to play Helmer as the character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have not seen a more egocentric character, unconscious and fair on the screen! But, I could forget a change of actor ... I just have to know how it ends!
