GOING !!! They did it on purpose !! Two of my current favorites on TV (Meloni of "Oz" and "L and O-SVU" and Janel of "West Wing") connect for a pretty little study of characters / characters. The plot is not extraordinary, but the acting is just on the mark. Tim Busfield presents himself for some interesting bits. Well worth a look.
