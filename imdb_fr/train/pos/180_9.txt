When Gundam0079 became the film trilogy we know for most of us, it was largely pure action. This OVA is a little the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it's not about action, but emotionalism. I think the two main action sequences are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many gundam series, movies and OVA, I was quite ready for a very civil movie. This movie did a fantastic job of that. This film stands out by the fact that it shows that both sides of the war have good and bad. It made the Zeons seem more human than the original films where they are described as the second rise of the evil Nazis. Most people who do not like the cartoons I forced to watch this movie (lol) liked it. So, I would recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story. If you are a fan of Gundam and have not seen this, you should not read it. you should already be looking at it right now.
