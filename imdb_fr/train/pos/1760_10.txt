THE 40-YEAR VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil and Kat Dennings. Funny comic hysterically funny about the incumbent Andy Stitzer (wonderfully portrayed by Carell, second perennial banana, in an incredibly comical performance that is sure to make it stratospheric), a technical services representative from a south electronics store California He discovered his secret identity by a trio of friends (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, all more rigorous than each other), determined to femininity, resolved to clear their friend at all costs. The following is an unlikely but very warm love story with a lively mother (the wonderful Keener having a lot of fun here) leading to more fuel for Andy's fires. A romantic comedy surprisingly serene and without excuse; the funniest since "There's something about Mary" with a cleverly watched scenario by directors Judd Apatow and Carell, which features surprisingly grueling sequences, including a scathing joke by David Caruso, a homophobic scathing speech and shipments of "date-a-paloozas" and demystify the war of the sexes with brazen aplomb. A real winner and an instant classic; the funniest movie of the year.
