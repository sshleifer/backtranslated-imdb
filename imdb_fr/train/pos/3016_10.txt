For those who love their mysterious murders, this is really the one to see because it is full of interesting and suspicious characters, most of them being rich socialist types of Long Island. As a star detective, William Powell is alternately staring and inspired, sometimes behaving as if he and his suit were going to the cleaner and hurrying. Mary Astor is very beautiful here. <br /> <br /> Powell had made the career of the main character, Philo Vance, a series of films shot in several studios for several years. Between these films, he became a somewhat offbeat romantic character, sometimes even trying to play the role of gentleman gangster. Already middle-aged, he was stuck in a kind of professional rut at the moment when he introduced himself. As with so many young walkie-talkie stars, it seemed like his time was over, that he was fine for the early films of the Depression Prohibition period, but that with the times he might be too mature and too dandyish to bear. <br /> <The case of Kennel Murder, headed by Michael Curtiz, a desperate criminal, is one of the last "old Powells", while next year will be announced in the first news, The Thin Man, whose success would catapult its main actors in the Hollywood stratosphere. In Kennel, we can see the movies always in a somewhat stiff and ritualized scheme, because the camera does not move much, the acting, like the presentation, tending towards the theater. There is no harm to this approach, however, which has its charms. This gives the film a baroque quality.
