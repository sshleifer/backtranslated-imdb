Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will sympathize with the protagonist of this independent film, a scared little boy who believes that a zombie is hiding in his closet. Does Jake (a bewitching Anthony DeMarco) simply "transfer" the trauma of two bickering parents into an understandable image? Or could the creature be real? Screenwriter / director Shelli Ryan perfectly matches both possibilities and lets the audience guess. His choice of using a single parameter - a suburban home - adds to the feeling of hopelessness and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as angry but loving parents. However, it is the frightening minor characters, Ms. Bender (Barbara Gruen), a helpless babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a shady realtor who hang out in the spirit. Jake's Closet is a dark portrait of childhood as a special hell.
