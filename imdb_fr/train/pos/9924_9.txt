Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new in the world of cinema. I really liked the movie because of the intricate plot, the varied characters and the intense camera effects. I've been complaining about the camera work and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, the bright and wild clich√©s were the culmination of mistakes made over time. All you see was the desired effect. Some may complain that something similar has never been done, although that is what sets it apart. In a deeper aspect, you see just how Domino sees things through his eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> Regarding history, I do not see anything wrong with that. Despite its "messy" nature, according to some, it would simply be a form of rapid narration. The plot is not so difficult to follow if you focus on what is happening. Maybe it's just me, because I see movies in different ways, like the actor, the plot, and so on. I'm not an "interpreter" or anything that distinguishes the movies, it's just for me. That said, I think the film is really excellent, despite its future classic cult, blockbuster or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, there is no doubt that the cast is varied. I think the actors are great because they all do a great job in describing their characters effectively, that's what makes a movie, ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and one advantage is that you can witness a small piece of each of their lives, differentiating them even further. Basically, I personally liked the cast and the characters. <br /> <br /> Anyone who criticizes and burns this film may not see it like me, or it does not appeal to them. It does not matter, it's a big movie in its own right, no, it's a beautiful film period.
