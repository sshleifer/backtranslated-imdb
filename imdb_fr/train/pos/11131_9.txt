I was browsing a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this movie had defeated Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for the best photo in 1969. After seeing it, I'm not surprised anymore. He was way ahead of his time in his style, cinematography and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in short film. I think Voight captured naivety and evils. The two scenes that really caught me were after he had a pipe at the theater and when the old man asked for it. I think when he looks in the mirror, he tries to see if it's really him who has done or is about to do something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to play this role. . Otherwise, it could have been cataloged after the graduate. Anyway, this was considered excellent for a reason.
