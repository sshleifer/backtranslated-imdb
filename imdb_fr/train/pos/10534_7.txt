Whether it's a good movie or not, I think such films have to be made. It reminds me of "I love Huckabees", an incredibly confusing film in which Isabelle Huppert is sodomized by a young American in a mud pond, in a joyful sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope that the director will continue to cross the border, as if I felt that Vincenzo Natali's choices were not always subtle (some scenes were unfortunately a kind of "cream pie", like a childish slapstick), speaking Scenario and cinematography? The color of "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprisingly, than the old Natali films.
