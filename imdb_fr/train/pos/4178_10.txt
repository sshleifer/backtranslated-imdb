This film is a true reflection of the Australian ingenuity needed to make this country what it is over the past 200 years. Not pompous like the British, not Gung-Ho like the Americans. If any of these countries had tried to do what this crew had done, it would have failed miserably. Either out of ignorance on the part of the British, or by too much confidence in a higher firepower on the American side. The "real" Australians (ie the non-importers) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
