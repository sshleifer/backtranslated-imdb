This movie was amazing. It's an inspiring piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth in which Lucy Walker brings the film. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for this special film that shows humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker presents the beauty of the landscape. This film is a true example of man against nature and sometimes of man against man. Inner turmoil and triumph are enormous in its subject. The subject of how the Tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film highlights a particular culture that has never been presented. Lucy Walker gave a voice to Erik Weihenmayer when he would not normally have been heard. Thank you Lucy for being faithful to your vision as a filmmaker.
