I have never been a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare away audiences, such as loud noises and terrifying children. They generally lack originality and contain a lot of things to do. The only horror movie I liked was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well played and had a beautiful story. Stanley Kubrick's film, The Shining, is arguably the scariest film of all time. <br /> <br /> The film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to monitor a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors that the place was haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced that everything will be fine and that he can use silence to overcome his author's blockage. After months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes cranky and violent afterwards. Is the cabin feverish or is there something in the hotel that drives him crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing aspects of the film is Kubrick's sense of isolation. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are huge but still empty. He is also strangely calm when Jack's son is cycling in the barren corridors. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his best, as it scares me and allows me to go out once in a while. My favorite scene is where he talks to a ghost from a built-in refrigerator. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, The Shining is at the top for horror movies. Witch project. It may be old, but it's really a goodie. 8/10
