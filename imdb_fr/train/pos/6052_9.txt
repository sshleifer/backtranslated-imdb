Strongly recommended !! <br /> <br /> A fun and well written film that will please everyone with humor !!! Go ahead, it's nice to see an independent British movie more than holding your own against the big established studios !! Worth to be added to any movie collection. There are scenes in this film that many people will understand, I'm sure. You will laugh at the antics and enjoy the soundtrack. I particularly enjoyed the version of Jimmy Cliff's Vietnam of Orb and that of the Tower of London on Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, you will not be disappointed.
