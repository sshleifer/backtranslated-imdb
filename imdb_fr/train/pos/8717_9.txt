I must admit from the outset that I am not a big fan of "family" movies nowadays. Most of them, in my humble opinion, are sentimental shit. But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous Pixar movie, is very funny. The two main characters were perhaps a little too bland (especially compared to the two actors of ANTZ, but otherwise, this film is better), but the rest of the film more than compensated. The animation looked great, the humor, though wide, was always good (I especially liked Hopper's sentence "If I had not promised mom on her deathbed that I would not kill you no, I'll kill you! "), And the actors doing the vocals, except the two chiefs, were all fantastic (Denis Leary does an animated film, which concept). And like everyone else, I loved the outings! I hope the video has the new ones.
