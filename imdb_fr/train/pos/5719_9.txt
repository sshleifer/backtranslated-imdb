As I have noticed with many comments on IMDb, some critics seem to insist that every film they see has smartly-crafted tracings that are lined with their intelligence. I am not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, shots and exploits. If I watch a comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You had the idea. Therefore, watching a horror movie, I especially want to be afraid. The Grudge is a very scary movie, in its well-executed "jumping" scenes and scary images. I've been a fan of horror movies for many years and I'm talking about masters such as Dario Argento, rather than horror film directors for teenagers on treadmills who have been filmed in recent days. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. Much more scary than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also consider an excellent film).
