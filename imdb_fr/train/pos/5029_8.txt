I went in this movie maybe a little tired by the hackneyed movies that are rife on the screen these days. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly punctuated by a dark and dark atmosphere. Even more surprising was the very limited amount of blood actually shown. As in most good movies, this one leaves something to be desired and Bill Paxton has done a great job as a director. The scenes were well shot inside the car and, after watching the episode "Anatomy of a Scene" at the end of the video, it was good to see some of the subtle and wonderful things that I had noticed were intentional and not just a type of direction "Oh, it looks good, keep it". It's a bad mood movie, filled with sadness. Nevertheless, for the dark subject, a considerable part of it is filmed in the light of day, even in some of the most disturbing scenes. The acting is exceptional (well, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never goes too far. On the contrary, it is very moderate, which works extremely well for this type of film. If a field is missing in this film, it's in the end, which seems a bit too artificial, but still works at a simpler level without destroying the mood or message of the film. What is the message? It's something that every individual decides for himself. Overall, on a scale of 1 to 10, this film scores an 8 for those who love the Southern Gothic genre (ie: "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"), and about 5 for those who't.
