A great thriller with a slow and awesome camera work that adds to the drama makes it a treat to watch and enjoy. The director-writer Brian de Palma makes a super imitation Hitchcock (many call it a "scam") with this film and the widescreen DVD 2.35: 1 is a must to fully appreciate the work of the camera (and several scenes with people hiding on each side who are lost on tapes formatted for television). <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of the film, at least for anyone with some sort of moral standard, is the general misery of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis NYPD (who has the hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene remains shocking with a scene of Angie Dickinson's shower quite long and explicit enough, even 25 years after its release. The film contains several erotic scenes like Dickinson (if it's really she who is on the big-shots) and Nancy Allen are not shy to show off their bodies. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the scene after the murder. The first 36 minutes are captivating and although the killer is obvious, the suspense remains fun and enjoyable to watch, especially for men nagging naked women.
