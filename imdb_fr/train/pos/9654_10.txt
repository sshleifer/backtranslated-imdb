Stéphane Rideau was already a star for his tour de force in "Wild Reeds", and he is one of the biggest independent stars in France. In this film, he plays Cedric, a boy from the region who meets Mathieu on vacation (the newcomer, Jamie Elkaim, in an astonishing, nuanced and ethereal show) at the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with his sick, demanding mother of his aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon, they fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The film's fractured narrative - composed of long rollbacks, bits of the present, and a move to the future in real time - is a little intimidating. Director Sébastien Lifshitz does not tell us what time period we are in and the scenario can be difficult to follow. But make no mistake: the last 45 minutes of the movie are so captivating that you can not leave the eyes of the eye. By turns heartbreaking and edifying, this film classifies the film "Beautiful Thing" as a cinema to see absolutely.
