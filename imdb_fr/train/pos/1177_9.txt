I've seen a lot of PPVs in the past, but it's the most entertaining and intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. The DVD bonuses are worth it because they give a different insight into how the wrestlers act after the show (like the interview with Chris Benoit), a glimpse of the days of Monday Night Wars, the first game of the winning title from Hogan Gold and some promotional speeches. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Team Match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 It was a very good and intense match to start the series. Not too much catch and just pure physicallity. Spike can manage in table games and Guerro and Benoit have given good skills of pure wrestling on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble with Nidia c. The crowd was not really interested in any of the wrestlers and was not interested until Kidman made the press on shooting stars. Usually, people expect a lot of flying high in a cruiser championship, but there were very few. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, nobody cared or knew it (it shows in the absence of blinking of the camera). The end was fast though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy c. William Regal 5/10 I never really liked the treat as a wrestler, it lacks intensity and style. Hardy was impressive but really did not have the chance to show his high thief status, although he still made some good counters and added that he needed a fast pace for the match. It ended quickly, which was perfect for this game. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena c. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's fun to remember Cena's first ever PPV, his demeanor, dress, and appearance (look at his interview, it's pretty funny). It was a good intense match with Cena showing a nice variety of shots, suplexes, counters and some aerials. Jericho was mediocre, but certainly helped Cena launch his career. Cena wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 It was a very intense and good match. Both styles of wrestlers marry really well on the screen, with the sheer power and raw energy of Brocks compared to the skill of DRV movements and its speed. RVD looked great in this match (better than later matches with edge and cena) and the whole game was fast. The end worked perfectly because it still preserved the undefeated sequence while offering RVD its right desserts in its home country. <br /> <br /> 6. No disqualification match: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked some intensity as a RVD match but which remained a good follow up. Although it started a little slowly (which is still the case for the big shows), Booker T was impressive and made a sickly gesture on the announcer's table. The finisher was great, the end was a big surprise and a big improvement for Booker T. 7 /. WWE Team Championship: Hogan and Edge c. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 It was a mediocre match. Hogan comes out as usual with a huge pop, but his variety of moves lacks intensity and energy. Again, Christian does not have exactly the best sports skills. This ended up being a mediocre match at best, but it was still acceptable for the PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Match three threats for the undisputed championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easily the match of the year. This is by far the best triple threat match I have ever seen. There were heavy falls, many finishers, stolen thieves, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. Nobody could predict who would come out of it. If you are going to buy this DVD, I will buy it strictly for this match. (Finishing - watch for yourself!) <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a solid pay-per-view network with many bonuses for you to watch over and over again. Although it's hard to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD), it's definitely worth it.
