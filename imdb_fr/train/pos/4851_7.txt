Ghost Train is a fun and entertaining film, typical of the best British comedy coolers of the '30s and' 40s. Comedian Arthur Askey's antics are not as fun as they once were, but you can overcome it by considering as a period piece or a curiosity. <br /> <br /> For a low-budget war production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective and provides real suspense. Very fun for a dark night (and, yes, stormy). Lighten up, take off the critic's hat and have fun.
