In one of her first films, Romy Schneider shines as young Queen Victoria of England, while she suddenly rose to the throne at the age of 18, learns to govern despite the machinations of politicians, and eventually becomes a lover and marries Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (though surprisingly true to real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. See this film about British royalty in German adds to its picturesque charm. In this respect, one wonders why an Austrian film was made about an English queen; but we remember that in 1954, Austria was still under occupation by allied troops, including British. Perhaps this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
