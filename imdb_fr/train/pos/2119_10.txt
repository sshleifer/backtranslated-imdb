"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films by director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he is filled with extraordinary actors such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. This is the kind of characters actors Hollywood does not use anymore. In fact, the film itself is the kind of movie Hollywood does not do anymore. (The makers of "You've Got Mail" claim that their film is a remake, but it's only praise.) Anyway, if you have a fondness for romantic comedies of the 1940s, you will discover "The Shop Around the Corner" to be simply wonderful. Just as well with repeated viewing. Enjoy!
