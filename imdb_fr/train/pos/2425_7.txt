I caught this film on IFC and enjoyed it, even though I felt that editing was a bit difficult, although it may be deliberate. I had a bit of trouble understanding what was happening at first, as they seemed to want a bit of a presentation of the non-linear Pulp Fiction style plot. It seemed a bit forced, though. I certainly think the film is worth watching, but I think it would have taken a bit of cleaning. Some scenes do not seem to make sense after others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the note here as low as it is. It is not exceptional, but there are no serious problems. I gave him a 7/10. The film shows at least that Laurence Fishburne can play whenever he wants. They just had to tell him not to do it in the Matrix movies.
