One of the things I've always liked about thrillers Robert Ludlum is that when you think you've understood it, it's going in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this movie that my neck hurts. <br /> <br /> One thing I also like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he was dependent on directing and, in this case, writing (with his brother Rick) a good story. <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even as they play characters they have all perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in people, and that will keep you interested and guessing until the end.
