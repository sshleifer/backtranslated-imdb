Of course, this film is dark and cute and full of clich√©s, but it's fun, and that's why I watch movies. For fun. Natasha Henstridge is beautiful, even with short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be disguised. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love him. The two of them seemed to really like each other in this movie. I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. I guess we see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even though Abo's British accent slipped into his supposed Bronx speech. To tell you the truth, I did not really notice it before reading these comments, but I went back to the DVD and her dialogue seems more British than American, but she was ideal for her role, with this exception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of two nice people who get married with other important people, but who find their soul mate in each other. It may be an unlikely story, but who said that the films are all supposed to be documentaries? It's no more unrealistic than one of the hourly dramas on the tube. That's why we watch them to escape a few moments of everyday life and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought that these actors had done a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who easily tears up. Do not get me wrong though, it must be a sentimental scene, and this film has had a lot of it. <br /> <br /> I give him 9/10 only because I keep my 10/10 for that however, a super beautiful movie, that I do not know, will come one day. If you see this being announced as coming on Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies, or whatever, make a note of it. I think you will like it.
