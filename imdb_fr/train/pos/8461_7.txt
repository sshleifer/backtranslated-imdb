The title being in English and IMDb indicating the main language of this program in English, I will focus on the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) presented in the DVD game published by Bandai. My current comment for the whole series is under IMDb's entry "" Shin kid√¥ senki Gundam W "(1995). <br /> <br /> Very little has changed in terms of Intrigue, writing and characterization It really depends on your liking to choose the language in which to watch this show Purists can stay true to Japanese, but for a more "realistic" experience, I recommend the English track, because all the characters, with the exception of Heero Yuy, are not Japanese (most of them are Caucasian with some non-Japanese Asians.) In the first place, the personalities of the characters meet more "directly" than in the Japanese version The contrast between the characters is even stronger, exceptional performances but a very well interpreted group of actors. <br /> <br /> Wing Gundam pilot, Heero Yuy, is a highly qualified soldier who suppresses his emotions but app slowly renders the value of his humanity. Exposed by Mark Hildreth, who stalled can be criticized as "bad action" but it fits very well with the personality of Heero. <br /> <br /> Deathscyle Duo Maxwell of Gundam, always cheerful in the face of death, receives an intensive class to cherish the value of life and his friends. He is perhaps the best-played character in the series, played brilliantly by Scott McNeil. He may look too old for his age, but Duo's English voice easily surpasses that of the irritable and nasal Japanese. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lost and lonely soul that has for the moment only been a fight; In spite of his inner desire to form bonds with his entourage, he knows only how to kill, not to befriend. Kirowa Morrow gives a dark but realistic performance in the role of Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> The winner of the Four Rebarba Winner is expressed by Brad Swaile who does not hesitate to express the affectionate character of his character and the din of his innocence while he lives the horrors of war and death firsthand. A huge advantage is that Quatre does not sound more like a girl (and yes, he is voiced by an actress in the Japanese version), but as a typical 15 year old guy. <br /> <br /> The impulsive but determined Wufei Chang voiced by Ted Cole may seem a little exaggerated but it contrasts radically with the more moderate roles of Heero and Trowa. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian sounds older in English, voiced by Lisa Ann Bailey. It may not appeal to his youthful personification at the beginning of the series but as his character matures in history, his voice has followed suit and fits very well with the development of the character. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise would be one of the most drastically altered voices compared to the Japanese version. The two voices bring out different faces of the same character. His Japanese voice is haughty, authoritarian and imposes respect, in harmony with his high status and charismatic character. Brian Drummond's English voice is more subdued, more sneaky, and "snake-like," underscoring Zechs' secrecy about his hidden agenda and unyielding beliefs in his ideals. <br /> <br /> OZ members are a really mixed bag. The voice of Treize Kushrenada, expressed by David Kaye, is more realistic and realistic than his larger-than-life style of Japanese speech. However, Lady One does not give her shared personality as contrasted as in the Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin just sounds ......... bored most of the time. Cannonfire pilots and military leaders are not examples. <br /> <br /> I would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic origins. The voices of Maganac Corp were generally not inspired, but could have been more interesting if they had received accents from the Middle East. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would also have sounded better with an elegant European accent that reflects their status as nobility. <br /> <br /> Despite the unsatisfactory play of the secondary characters, the main cast manages to bring the show and it results in a less realistic and more realistic interpretation of the Gundam Wing script. Very faithful to the original Japanese scenario, he keeps all the underlying ideas that generate ideas and themes on politics, war and human nature. Unfortunately, it also retains the flaws of the original Japanese script.
