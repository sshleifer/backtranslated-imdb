It's a bloody mess and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson is very much at the head of this film with his clever portrait of the appalling practitioner of mad control. Linda Hoffman plays his unfaithful wife and she is very easy to watch - unfortunately for her, the little "appointment" with the pool guy is a severe punishment that the good doctor knows best - too bad for that pretty smile! The last half-hour of the film is devoted to the total loss of Bernson's character. A young actress by the name of Virginya Keehne is in the spotlight. An extremely talented performer, she attracts attention from the moment the splints come loose. Beautiful legs too!
