The first time I came across Delirious, I only heard it. I listened to all the comic performance and I have never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint hilarious images in our minds and to make great imitations is captivating. When I finally saw him doing this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows his genius! As it is the new millennium, his actions in 1983 are just as amusing today as at the time. My parents loved it as a teenager and I (18 years old) love it too. From that point on, I had to watch other Murphy films such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
