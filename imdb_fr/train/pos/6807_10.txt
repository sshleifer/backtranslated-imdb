I have copies of these two films, the classic Robert Blake is a great actor. Most of the 1967 film, Blake, is shown next to a prison window recounting his childhood life, where he is since why he killed the Clutter family. showing a lot in the classic of what really happened does not tell us which one really did the murder, but it really catches the eye if you watch the 1996 movie in Cold Blood, the classic makes a lot more sense.
