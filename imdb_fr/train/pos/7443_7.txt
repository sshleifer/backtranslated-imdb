An old adage says, "If you think you have problems, visit a hospital." This has been updated in recent years for "If you think you have problems, watch a TV show ... especially that of Jerry Springer!" This film is one of those who is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave him a seven. Everything is fine, but not great. This is a great way to lose 95 minutes, just like the daily talk show is presented as "an hour of your life that you will never find!" All the familiar themes are here ... unfaithful husbands / boyfriends, the craziest public on TV, women showing Jerry, etc. The overwhelming looked at Molly Hagan, who normally plays sweet characters from trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly ("My name is Earl") as her equally trashy daughter, rendering sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they entered. contact. The men (including the producer) were presented as lunkheads who deserved what they had. I do not want to ruin or reveal everything, but the film unfolds like everyday life. Here in Phoenix, it is presented two hours in a row, then everything seems to pale. Again, I give this film a seven ... it's good but not great. It is best to take Jerry Springer in small doses of one hour.
