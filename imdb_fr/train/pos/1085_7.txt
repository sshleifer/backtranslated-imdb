This film was a pretty funny comedy about Murphy's law applied to property and construction. If a film like this was filmed today, there is no doubt that the family would be dysfunctional. Since it was in the "simpler" quarantine, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the time. Of course, Grant perfectly mixes comic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent distribution of support, underlined by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans make 90 minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
