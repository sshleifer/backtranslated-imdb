I've always thought that David and Bathsheba were a film originally intended for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck recounts well as King David, the wandering monarch. <br /> <br /> Many Bible subjects are covered in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what God expects from his followers. <br /> <br /> When you are king, even king in a biblical prophecy Kingdom, you certainly have many unopened privileges to the rest of us. King David has many women, including a very naughty one to Jayne Meadows, daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But his eyes see Bath-Sheba in his garden one evening. It turns out that she is as badly married to Uria the Hittite as David is to many women. Uriah is one of the captains of David's army. David brings Bathsheba and he is king, she rushes because she is watching him too. <br /> <br /> What's going on, an adventure, a pregnancy and a carefully arranged death for Uriah in a battle. But a deity who sees and knows everything has captured all this and punishes not only David and Bathsheba, but the entire Kingdom of Israel is punished with drought, sickness and plague. <br /> <br /> The sexist law of the day calls Bathsheba to death by stoning. David is showing weakness in his previous actions, but here he comes to the plate and asks that everything be put on him. He even puts his hand on the Ark of the Covenant, which was an instant death, as the film shows. <br /> <br /> My interpretation is that God admires the guts even if you make a mistake and lets David down. and forgive them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon, and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they are both conquered. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is an alley seeking Bathsheba taken in a love-less marriage with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that excites Moore is a good fight. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid back. <br /> <br /> No one can make the law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet is in harmony with the character of John Brown, he played in two films, same intensity. <br /> <br /> Then, when His own law called for death, why did God spare Bathsheba and keep David on the throne? Maybe it was the fact that he just did not want to train a third guy for the job. He had already replaced Saul by David. <br /> <br /> But I think the Christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the coming New Testament, that one could sin and receive mercy if one asked him penitentially . I will leave it to Bible scholars to submit their interpretations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and you could come up with an entirely new theory.
