Tenko is undoubtedly the best British TV show of all time, the performances, the staging, the casting, the suspense, the drama ..... everything is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Although the show fell a little later in its last season, this end film has taken the threads and woven a great story for fans of the show and beginners. I can not recommend this movie anymore, find it and watch it. But I advise to watch the series first, because the first two seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> Evidence (10/10)
