I had not laughed so much for a movie for a long time. The trash that Hollywood has put these days makes me hover a wall! This one was really fresh and spiritual. If you look at the demographic figures for the ranking, only a few women voted! I do not want to ruin the movie for you, but I'm sure all the guys who saw it ran to their computer to rate it and give it a poor score, why? Because film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this film because of its real humorous value and not because it is damaging to men ... it could easily be a movie rated "7"!
