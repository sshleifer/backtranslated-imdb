What is very French in this film is the time needed to establish the two main characters. This might require a little patience, especially since nothing is "attractive" in the typical Hollywood definition. However, once the "holdup" begins, the film rushes quickly, perhaps sometimes too quickly. But it's a real roller coaster ride and if you do not look too closely, it's quite believable. The kind of movie you know, Hollywood would have failed.
