Teen Eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated by his obsession with heavy metal music. One day, he discovers that his hero Sammi Curr is dead, allegedly burned by the establishment that wanted to end his music. But Eddie has his last album, never released, and when he plays it, he begins to receive messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors. Before long, Sammi announced his intention to return to local life at Halloween to take revenge on the city that had once mocked him. <br /> <br /> Filled with humor and jokes, this movie is extremely entertaining. Sammi himself is a nasty original horror film that plays on the obsessions of the "80s rock music evils." It's worth watching.
