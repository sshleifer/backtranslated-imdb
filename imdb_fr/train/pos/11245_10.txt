I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time in 1980 and I thought it would be one of the "movie classics". This film is a good overview of the music industry with excellent distribution. It's a film that should be in the collection of everyone and everyone who wants to get into the music industry. I can not wait for it to be available on DVD.
