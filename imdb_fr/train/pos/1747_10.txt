This movie was one of the best movies I saw this year. I did not see any cameos in the movie, but it's still pretty good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think it's a better movie. He does have a point. If you are going to see a lot of T & A, you will be disappointed. Just a movie well mounted !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or if you need a lot of humor, you will find that it is a very good movie. I really think that the criticism of this film by Ebert and Roeper is accurate. I mean, I do not really like Ebert in most movies, but that's the movie I'll agree on. The film contains a story good enough for it to be really credible that this type of people exists. There is certainly something to say about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yes, of course, we make fun of the discovery, but it still suggests that you were waiting. Steve did a wonderful job describing the person he did in this film and yet it's still funny.
