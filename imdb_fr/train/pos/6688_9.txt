"The story of comic-based movies," Mystery Men "is one of the most underrated, not a comic superhero movie, it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men "covers several aspects of superhero movies such as" Superman "or" Batman ", such as pithy sayings and questions about secret identities.Most superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but types of blue-collar workers with low-level jobs and neurotic lives at home, so it seems that director Kinka Usher turns heroes into something that the average viewer can understand.I found that "Mystery Men" was visually stimulating and very Even if it does not turn into a franchise, that's is a joy to watch!
