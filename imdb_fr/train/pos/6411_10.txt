It's one of the best military movies ever made. And it's great because of his interest in values. It's a beautiful story of human interest that is based on a commitment to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are excellent in the lead roles. It's wonderful to see the Master Chief's racism evolve towards respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, motivation and sense of honor. The title indicates the source of their link. I never noticed until this last time how Carl Lumbly's portrait of Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was brilliant. In a sense, this is the cornerstone of the film because it is the memory of his father that helps Carl through difficult times. <br /> <br /> I select the movies I buy. It's one of those few that I want on my shelf. We'll see many times in the future, I'm sure.
