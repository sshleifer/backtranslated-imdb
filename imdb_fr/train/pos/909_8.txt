I liked these movies. This is another Yash Raj movie that you know well on screen, all the characters are always nice or very nice, with one exception that will eventually hide ... Another principle of Yash Raj's film is whether it's a hero or a heroine; s has only one or no parent. Think back to all these movies. MPK Suman had no mother, HMAPK Salman had no parents, AND FINAL is that you are 90% likely to see Alock Nath crying ... <br /> <br /> The film is also good. It's a bit slow at first, but it's entertaining. There is almost no comedy but it often makes you smile enough. The little child (the nephew of the hero) is well placed and delivers very good liners. The actress is very pretty but shy, you will not get that in real life. this film does not have any luckily large families living in the big house, which has earned me a good idea and allowed the film to differentiate itself from other films. There will be many women who will cry at the end of the film. There is no strong message of this film but it is a good watch. If you are married (arranged marriage), the movie will remind you of what you have experienced. And if you are not, it will inform you and maybe scare you ... <br /> <br /> Overall, a very beautiful film. No big conspiracy or twists but a very soft film, very similar to the Bollywood classic.
