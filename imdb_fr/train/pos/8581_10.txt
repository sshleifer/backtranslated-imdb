It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. All those who consider this film as absolute are obviously not smart enough to capture all the subtle humor that this film has to offer. This shows us that real life and "fictional" action can produce a winning combination. In addition, as a romantic comedy, it offers one of the smartest ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all this and Donald Sutherland sing a song like "They'll find your anus on a mountain on Mars".
