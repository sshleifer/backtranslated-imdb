Until the sixth and final episode of the saga Star Wars, which finally ended in 2005, I always considered this entry of 1983 as my favorite movie of the long series. The varied action scenes and the really different characters (Jabba The Hut, creatures of the hairy woods, etc.) made it a particularly attractive film. <br /> <br /> None of the stocks has ever focused too long in one place. The last half-hour shows it well, as the scene passes every few minutes from the woods to the spacecraft battle and the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> Another nice feature of this movie was that the previous two was not the absence of infighting between two of the stars. The incessant quarrels between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford have disappeared. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was simply a wonderful story of adventure, more than anything else.
