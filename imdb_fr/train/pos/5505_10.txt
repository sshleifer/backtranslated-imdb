It's something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup d'etat and some Irish directors are documenting themselves. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages him to read the constitution is openly defamed by the private media as dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc. without repercussions on the part of governments (for example, by silencing them with bullets or other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, and they always claim that they are being repressed, of course. <br /> <br /> See how the media are bragging about their role in the coup on television after toppling the government with the help of redheads (how much can you be more stupid ?? ). <br /> <br /> And see how Venezuelans are walking towards the palace, holding the constitution in their hands and resettling their elected government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it happened for real, against the explicit wishes of the United States. The documentary is a historic masterpiece, drawn from the center of action, acute and totally embarrassing for the main supporters of the coup: the United States, good, democratic, freedom-loving and benevolent (who pay still large sums of money to the political opponents of Chavez). <br /> <br /> Also very entertaining and exciting. 10 points.
