I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma". I've seen it many times and I'm always looking forward to seeing it again. Even if it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the new plots and subplots have been developed satisfactorily. . All characters are well represented. Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel, without silly jokes, as in Emma Thompson's Sens and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of actors. The decor and costumes were beautiful. I find this version quite comparable to the 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice", but the producer and the scriptwriter were identical. Kate Beckinsale did a very good job in describing "Emma", which Jane Austen said would create a heroine that no one would like herself. She is snobby but has just enough youth and inexperience to stay friendly. Mark Strong was also very good at interpreting Mr. Knightley, a difficult part, I think, although he does not have the charisma demonstrated by Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice by Colin Firth. Even the ending scene (the harvest festival) that does not occur in the novel provides an appropriate end, except in the case that it shows that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill, whereas in the novel she was completely reconciled with him, even telling him that she would have appreciated the duplicity she had been in her situation. A strange departure from the fidelity displayed throughout the film. I find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations of Jane Austen's novels.
