This film shows life in northern Cameroon from the point of view of a French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official of the French colonial government and whose family is one of the few white families that exist. This gives an idea of ​​what life was for both the settlers and the natives with whom they associated. It is a feeling that corresponds to another film I saw about Africa at a similar time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or realistic it is. typical. It's not just an impression - things are happening in the movie - but the plot is underestimated. The viewer is free to draw his own conclusions rather than impose constraints on filmmakers, although the narrative of the story as a step back from the woman's visit to southwestern Cameroon to adulthood gives some perspective.
