A horror film is being shot and things are not going well. This is a masked killer. The director awards the killer in front of the actors and the team. He goes crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the film is never finished. Twelve years later, many film students decide to try to finish it - but there is a spell. People who try to finish it are killed. Students do not know it. Guess what will happen next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old, but it's not bad ... for what it is (a low-budget slasher movie). It's done well with a young and quite talented young cast. No one is great but nobody is terrible either. This also avoids mandatory (and unnecessary) female nude scenes. It moves quickly, the blood is nice and bloody and the script does not insult your intelligence. Molly Ringwald is also playing the lead role of a faded actress. <br /> <br /> No big shake but not bad at all. I give him a 7.
