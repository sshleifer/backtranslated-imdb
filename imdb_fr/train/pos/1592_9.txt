'What I like about you' is without a doubt a show that I could not wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show "The Amanda Show". She is a very funny person and seems to be down to earth. "Holly" is such a capable person and has an "out-there" personality. I liked the way she always seemed to turn things upside down, so she made a mistake from time to time. But that's what made the show so great. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the show when the character "Vince" arrived. Nick Zano is very hot and funny, as well as "Gary," Wesley Jonathan. The cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially liked "Lauren"; She is the best! She helped make the show even more fun and you never know what she'll do or say next! Overall, the show is really nice, but the reason I did not give him a 10 is because there are no new episodes and because the episodes could have been longer and deeper .
