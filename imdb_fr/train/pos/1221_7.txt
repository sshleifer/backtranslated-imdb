For a long time, I liked this film better than the original Care Bears movie. Last summer, I looked at the two together and decided that I was wrong. The first is a better Care Bears movie (as you might have guessed if you read my opinion about it). This one is not a bad movie, it's just ... VERY FOREIGN. <br /> <br /> Well first, as mentioned by a few people, he totally disavows any knowledge of the first film. I can not think of another sequence that contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the genres of certain characters and the way they all met). When I was little and looked at it, I was a bit confused and helpless. I felt the same way by looking at him as an adult! <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good (IF you dissociate it from the first movie). I can not think of another children's movie with a DEMON because it's a bad guy! Now, I'm not for a moment suggesting that the devilish demons who want to steal the souls of campers and Care Bears are good, I find it cool that there is a SUPERIOR BEING IN a movie for little ones children! It's like this movie "Santa Clause vs. Satan" from Mexico that we sometimes hear about. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the Bisounours in exchange for giving him special powers. Very dark for a child movie eh? And did I mention that Darkheart appears most often to the girl as a 10-year-old boy, WHINY VOICED 10? Bizarre! Meanwhile, other kids are taking care of BABY CARE BEARS in Care-a-Lot! Oh, man! Demons and babysitters in the same movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything clears up in the end (but not before we can see Darkheart trapping the souls of the creepy chandelere guardians in a [surprisingly] deeply troubling scene). But it remains for me to know if this film has found the cult audience that it deserves so richly. I could just watch it myself again.
