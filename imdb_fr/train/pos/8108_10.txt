I have "Things to come", on D.V.D. and it's very clear compared to my VHS version. The sound is right, but can sometimes be difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the film so much that I looked for a copy of the book and found it. He explained in detail why some things had happened. The best things about the movie are the little things I did not notice at first. John Cabal playing with a toy airplane at a Christmas party, as if it were a dive bomber, was coming out of the power of the sea by naming a battleship, "Dinosuar". Ships sunk by air power, an insidious enemy attack not declared by airplanes. Airplanes with flying wings swept. Strong rolls for women throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are more, see the movie to enjoy.
