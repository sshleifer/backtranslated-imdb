Cypher of the director Vincenzo Natali is a complex and imaginative thriller that, although requiring a suspension of his convictions and a lot of concentration, manages to be a quite entertaining experience. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a married woman with a domineering wife, decides to add a little spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as industrial spy in the high-tech company Digi Corp. His job is to attend conferences across the country (under the supposed identity of Jack Thursby) and secretly retransmit the speeches given to his bosses, via a clever little electronic pen-gizmo. <br /> <br /> In reality, speeches are really just a cover for much more harmful activities. Morgan, along with the other participants in the conference, is brainwashed. The drugged water they drink puts them in a temporary coma during which they are told to forget their past and to permanently adopt their new identity. Once they are completely convinced of being someone else, they are asked to apply for jobs with rival companies, where they can indulge in espionage of unsuspecting companies. <br /> <br /> But Digi Corp's plans are foiled. intervention by Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), a crazy rental agent, who opens Morgan's eyes to what is really going on. It gives Morgan an antidote to the mind to modify drugs so he can resist brainwashing techniques. She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects him of not believing he is really Jack Thursby, he will be "eliminated". Morgan plays the game and applies for a job with rival firm Sunways. <br /> <br /> However, arrived at his new place of work, he undergoes a polygraph test and is immediately considered a spy. Fortunately, Sunways officials see this as an ideal opportunity to provide false data to Digi Corp. Morgan becomes a double agent. <br /> <br /> From that moment, things get progressively complicated; the plot turns and poor old Morgan ends up being unable to trust anyone. In a thrilling finale, everything finally becomes clear (but only if you followed the events with the greatest attention). <br /> <br /> The director Natali manages the debates with confidence and certainly has a great ability to produce a relatively low-budget, elegant film. He managed to obtain excellent performances from his talented actors. Jeremy Northam, in particular, is fantastic. His interpretation of Morgan, initially somewhat nervous, is played to perfection. <br /> <br /> Cypher is another fascinating film from a risk-taking director and I can not wait to see the future. to his next projects, High Rise and Necropolis.
