Again, it seems to me totally illogical, at least in my opinion, that Arthur deserves only 6.4 out of 10. Steve Gordon's unique masterpiece is totally "unlikely" if not quite " impossible "of extremely disparate elements. The fact that he managed to make alcoholism a friendly laugh rather than tearing him up tragically is, in itself, wonderful. The fact that he has entrusted Dudley Moore with his best role and that all the other cinematic elements of the series have an optimal impact, including the score, seem to me obvious and obvious. I challenge everyone to sit in this movie and not laugh out loud. But apparently, almost a third of his audience has succeeded. For my part, I find and find Gordon's effort both ET laughable and likeable, and the likes of Geraldine Fitzgerald's great aunt and Stephen Elliott's killer, true absolute jewels of background characters. Even the black driver managed to escape the attendance, and the late Sir John Gielgud was right to accept his fees, but wrong to assume his role. "Arthur" makes no effort to "Underztand", let alone to rationalize the plague of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not an alcohol, it's another drug of choice, including methamphetamine, and addictions are just symptoms, not targets), simply observes in his own interrogative way.
