... So what's missing in those 10 missing minutes so horrible that you had to cut them off from the original movie? We were three years in the production code of the film ... Barbara Stanwyck had played in the original piece, but here Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-starring Fred MacMurray is probably better known for "Double Indemnity" with Stanwyck, as well as for his hit show "My Three Sons". Keep an eye on the young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and the fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who spiced up just about every movie recorded. Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the boat! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and joking at the beginning. Maggie's boyfriend Ella is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend of "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High", Maggie, the tourist, meets a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie misses her boat when he leaves the harbor and gets entangled with the soldier. Quinn, a 20-year-old munch, has a small scene at the Panama bar where Johnson (MacMurray) plays the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid meet to try to find a way back to the United States. Good songs of Lamour. CÃ©cile Cunningham in the role of "Murph", wise and helpful owner of the local show in Panama. While others lamented the seriousness of the situation, it was not so horrible and even a little exotic, with the false decor of Central America for the first half of the film.
