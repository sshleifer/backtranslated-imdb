I watched this show based on what I was told it reminded me of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show I love. The series begins to quickly introduce us the main characters and the pilot episode is for me rather exceptional. He is extremely dramatic and really comes out of all the bad side of the series, ready to progress throughout the season. My biggest criticism is that I felt a little disappointed with the show - probably not by his fault, as it was canceled after only one season, it seemed to show a lot of potential and deserved a much better treatment. The acting is excellent and this show contains some of the best characters (good and bad) I've seen and that are well developed in a short time. There is the weird cheese effect for the first 5 or 10 shows that is a little too dramatic, but that is rectified as the season progresses. It's really worth a look, it's really something out of the ordinary!
