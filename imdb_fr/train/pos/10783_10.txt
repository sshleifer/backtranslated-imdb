I enjoyed this movie. I have not seen Andy Griffith for a very long time and I think he fits this role perfectly. I associated it with comedy but I am happy to see that it is versatile. <br /> <br /> I am not troubled by the fact that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" may not have been written verbatim in a psychiatric manual. There are zillions of phobias and neuroses, which can take a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive with extra-sensory powers as local Indians understood, but not by any Anglo. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although it is considered a "family film" light, it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Plus, Hiram's twist at the end was a pleasant surprise for me and linked all the previous actions in one package. It's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual direction.
