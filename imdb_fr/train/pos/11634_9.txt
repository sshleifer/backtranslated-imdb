I have just returned from an advanced projection of Redeye and I must say that I have not had so much fun in front of a movie for a long time. WES CRAVEN is at its best. He brings us an incredible end-of-summer thriller that I so desperately wanted. It's the thriller of the year .. no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are extraordinary and the action is realistic and fun. The F / X were great. This regularly built suspense. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. It's been a long time since I've heard an audience applaud and applaud and be excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for excitement, action and a good scenario this summer, REDYE meets your expectations. Go see him!
