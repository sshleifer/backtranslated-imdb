I'm a fan of ART, I love everything about Art, paintings, sculptures, etc. This film shows it, so I like it a lot, it shows that a woman wants to paint anything about Art, especially naked bodies, but she can not do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the film, she painted herself nude, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not let her paint nude men because it's against moral. Even though Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that he is absolutely in love with her too, so in the end, he sacrifices his freedom for his own by lying. He said he raped her, but it was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says that she is going to suffer a lot, because in the trial in which Artemisia, her father and the art teacher, was, someone was hurting her to tell the truth. I think it's a very good movie about ART and an artistic love, it's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she behaves very well, I also like her performance in Pansy Osmond's "The Portrait of a Lady". 8.5 / 10
