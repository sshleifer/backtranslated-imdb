To write something authentic and true is a challenge. Knowing how to photograph and assemble it without making it trivial is even better. Ishai Setton's film is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by "The Big Bad Swim" and from now on, I will promote it as far as I can. It's just a shame that I can not show anything to my friends (you know, like a DVD ???), because speaking is good ... but giving something to see is better. Everyone can not go to festivals to discover pearls like this and this movie is definitely worth it! A big THANK YOU to the staff of this masterpiece and I am waiting for it to be distributed.
