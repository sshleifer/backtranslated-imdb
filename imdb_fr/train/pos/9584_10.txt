Yes, this film is at the top. I can not recommend it anymore. Gay or strait, it's an excellent doco for all those who love cinema. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never boring. Excellent access. A film made with passion and interest for the subject. Some of the performances and just amazing. If you only find this film on VHS, it's still worth watching. Awesome. 10 of 10. I saw part of this doco about ten years ago and I did not understand what I was watching. The interviews are very revealing about the egos of the performers who are like heavy boxers trying to get out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a beginner so what an exploit. Cool. Hunt it.
