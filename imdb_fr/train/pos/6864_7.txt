I saw this film for the first time drunk in a motel in Canada. While browsing the channels, the Easy Lube part appeared. My friend kept spinning but I told him to come back. Something in the name Easy Lube did not sound right. Watching the rest of the movie it was damn funny. Take some generic names and go home to search for it. It turned out to be the first Chevy Chase movie. I did not remember it. I did not remember much, so I rented it and gave it a second view. It's quite funny and graphic enough. It's like Kentucky Fried Movie, except it's not that funny. I love fingers, the easy-to-wear lubricant and the role of the president. The dealer skit is pretty cool too. I give him a 6.5 or 7 out of ten
