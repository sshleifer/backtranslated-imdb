I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and I have never forgotten it. The film shows the horror of the war in a way that Hollywood usually conceals. The relationship between the soldiers of the two belligerent countries is evidenced by the differences in culture and the fact that we all know that in the end we are not really different on the inside. If you can find any type of copy, buy it or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just impressed.
