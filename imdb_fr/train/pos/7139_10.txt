John Thaw, Inspector Morse, plays the old Tom Oakley in this film. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and at the beginning of the Second World War. A little reclusive, Tom has not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son while serving in the First World War. If you can imagine that Inspector Morse is old and retired, twice as worked as when he was a policeman, then you have the character of Tom Oakley. <br /> <br /> Yet this flint heart is about to melt. The children of London are evacuated before the blitz. The young William (Willie) Beech is lodged with the protester Tom. Nick Robinson plays Willie wisely. <br /> <br /> This boy needs care with a capital C. Behind the school, still wet the bed and unable to read, that's the least of his problems. He comes from a horrible background in London, with a mother who can not cope, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Slowly, but still, the man and the boy are warming up. Tom discovers again his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See Tom and Willie building a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. See Willie's joy at his very first birthday party organized by Tom. <br /> <br /> I do not want to reveal the end, but Willie is adopted by Tom after many efforts and the couple begins a new life much richer. for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this film, Thaw and Robinson follow a long line of films where the man meets a boy and develops a mutual love. See the fire Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "It started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Brave Captains". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "The Faceless Man". <br /> <br /> Two points of interest. This is the only appearance of Thaw I know where he sings. Only a couplet of a hymn, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Second, the young Robinson also starred in a second movie starring "Tom" in the title "Tom's Midnight Garden", which is based on a classic children's novel.
