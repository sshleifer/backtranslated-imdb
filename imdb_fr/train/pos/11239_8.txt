Hidden Frontier is known to be the oldest series of Internet fans based on Star Trek. Although the quality of production is not up to fan productions like Starship Exeter or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier focuses primarily on the story, and in this respect, it is doing very well. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier does not have physics. sets; instead, the actors are filmed against a green screen and the backgrounds are digitally inserted. One of the greatest achievements of Hidden Frontier is the amount of work they have produced. One way to do this is to insert virtual sets at the time of shooting, rather than post-production. Although this saves a lot of time, it should also be noted that the quality of the resulting sequences is not as good as if they had been produced in post-production, although they still serve their purpose. <br /> <br /> Although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Hidden Frontier is definitely worth it, but you'd better start watching season three, because that's where it's all about. that producers really start to hit stride.
