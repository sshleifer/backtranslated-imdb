I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the talented Jack Wild. Now, my daughters also love Jack Wild fans. This movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertaining. This film is not limited to children either. Much of the dialogue is directed towards adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this film was perfect for Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a fan of Jack Wild, I would never fail to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack has now makes this movie even more wonderful, especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It pauses me in loving adoration of him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that I now pass on to my children. Let's all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun! And keep the memory of Jack Wild alive by transmitting Pufnstuff to others.
