"Der Todesking" is not exactly the type of movie that makes you happy ?? The second consecutive cult monument of Jörg Buttgereit, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", exists in seven short episodes ?? one for each day of the week ?? on the suicides of unrelated persons. Between these episodes already very troubling, Buttgereit inserts really horrible images of a male corpse in serious decomposition. Not all episodes are so powerful, but "Der Todesking" is high on the list of the most depressing films of all time. In particular, Wednesday's episodes, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a stranger in the park, and that of Sunday, centered on a young man who is being mutilated, are extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this film, or any other shock like this, is questionable and I'm not sure if Buttgereit had a message to communicate here. There is a vague mention of a strange chain of letters that encourages its readers to commit suicide, but we generally remain uninformed about the motivations of these people to end their lives in such a dramatic way. Unlike what I expected, "Der Todesking" is not an exploiting or repelling graphic! On the contrary, I could never have hoped that Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful about the representation of pure human misery. The episode on Thursday is a perfect example: it shows elegantly different points of view of a famous German bridge, while the names, ages and professions of people who have jumped appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably low and the editing often lacks professionalism, but that's not what really matters in this type of cinema. The subject is strong and forces us to meditate on the less gay ?? but also indispensable ?? aspects of life. Excellent use of tragic music, too!
