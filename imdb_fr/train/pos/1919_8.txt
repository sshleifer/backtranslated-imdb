I did not read the book on which this was based / inspired. This being a few (the others are movie roles) the last work of John Ritter (RIP), we hope it's hilarious. And it's. In fact, almost every time, he is present. Most actors, whether supportive or ordinary, play well against each other and the material tends to be excellent. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical guy of this age, Kerry, the average depressive child who fights for causes and to raise public awareness, and Bridget, the popular saying and in love with the fashion. Sagal again becomes the main woman of a sit-com and her character is very far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed somewhat after Mr. Three's company disappeared, and for a moment they did not seem to be able to make up their minds whether they wanted to have laughs, or be poignant and make sure they were respectful. One wonders how and why it lasted so long after that: it could still be good enough, some additions were lucky (if you like David Spade, most of his role is that he does his job ) and had things to say. . My favorite personal episode is in the last season. Humor is a good mix of jokes of "stupid people" (mainly related to high school students), nonsense, dark comedies and raw materials. It dealt with sex and other adult topics, but never graphically. The tongue is soft and sometimes moderately strong. I recommend it to all the fans of those who did it. 8/10
