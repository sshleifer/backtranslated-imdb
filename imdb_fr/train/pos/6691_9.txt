This movie is very funny. Two things are particularly interesting: it's the simple way the characters adopt stereotypes, with discussions about their costumes and their super powers. The parody is very attractive and imbued with great sincerity; the second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special attention as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There is a lot of talent here. I realize that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is very entertaining and quite nice.
