It's very very funny. You know, as a comedy is supposed to be. It also looks very very good, like a Hollywood Spectacular. So, what more do you want? Howz on a very good Sally Fields. She's so much better here than in everything I've seen her before, and she looks so good. This film is all you need to understand why she is a star. Those eyes! Like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, all eyes are so good. I pretended to be a bad soap opera actor with my girlfriend. We would do this thing where you look very quickly from one eye to the other of your partner. They do not do it at all in a soap dish. Awesome. The eyes have it! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many fantastic performances that her pleasure is waiting for each one of them to reappear. With Kevin Kline, there is a whole workshop on how to over react in a very subtle way. Got that? Yes, he's damn good. The same goes for Robert Downey, Jr., who has since embarked on a career playing in Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, while not the most talented actress, is so charismatic and so captivating, especially when she is angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, his natural timing here gives a somewhat flat delivery to Zing. OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I hear you. <br /> <br /> And then, there is hair. The soap dish was made at the end of the BIG Hair Eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a big character in themselves. They become bigger and more stupid, just like yours. Yes, we have pictures. <br /> <br /> A soap dish is better than I thought, better than I wanted it. I'm tired of movies telling me that I'm supposed to be interested in the egomaniacs, egocentric and semi-talented, that is to say. Soap TV actors. Soap dish seems happy just to make me laugh. Thank you.
