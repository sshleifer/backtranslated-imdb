This film has problems in its presentation, can even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural fidelity, but it invites the viewer to think about a variety of problems. One of them is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-Traitor relationship is developed and maintained through the film. The passion of Judas is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas commits suicide, the viewer can feel anguish. Peter's denial and guilt, as moving as they may be, are not as powerfully described as the drama of Judas. Chris Sarandon proposes an innovative and provocative Christ, credible or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even on VHS, to use in study groups or discussion groups.
