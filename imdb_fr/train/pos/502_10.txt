Ok, so it comes with a few weeks late, but it's here. This is mainly due to statements of different negative natures. Starting with technology. When Star Trek: TOS was running, the special effects technology was extremely low, and even more, the crew had very little money to make the appropriate models. In the 35 years since TOS was founded, the Star Trek crew has become an expert in economics. <br /> <br /> In the end, they rightly decided to give up the look of TOS and TNG reverse engineering and everything. What if they decided not to confuse the carrier with gold flakes or bring the guns closer to those of Star Trek II? With regard to the slits chosen at the time of first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed that, according to Kirk and Riker, the Earth would not have met the Klingons until 2200. Nothing was firmly established. <br /> <br /> The company gives us the most promising exploration site we've seen in a while. That's what Voyager could have been. No series can evolve without some inconsistencies, but know that Star Trek has so little. So, stop taking it and enjoy it.
