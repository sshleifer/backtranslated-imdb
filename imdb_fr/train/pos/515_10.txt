I remember the first time I saw this movie - I was in the office working on weekends and the TV was on for background noise. But I gradually found myself more engaged in this film of which I had never seen or heard until I was completely absorbed. A question of life and death (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the United States) is a delight, a charm, a fantasy and an emotion, all in a superbly written package, well played and perfectly directed. This is a classic that really stands out as Casablanca, It's a wonderful life, carried in the wind, Citizen Kane and Chariots of Fire. WHY has it never received the same public notice and visibility as video clubs? Fortunately, some critics warned the ONT put on their list of "100 best of all time". There is hope - Fantasia of the 1940s was not a success until the 1960s, and the Wizard of Oz was a box-office failure, but was a resounding success on television. Buy it - rent it - look at it - ask for it! You will not be disappointed!
