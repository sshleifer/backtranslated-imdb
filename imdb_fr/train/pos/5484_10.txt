This film is essentially a documentary of the series of chronological events that took place from 10 to 14 April 2002 at the Venezuelan Presidential Palace in Caracas, Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The pathos of the film is real. and we feel the pain, the sorrow and the joy of the people who lived through this failure of the coup d'Ã©tat of President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this film shows that Hugo Chavez is really a great historical figure. The character of Hugo Chavez alone has led the Venezuelan people to overthrow the military junta installed three days ago and to restore the government of Venezuela democratically installed. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the film footage that George W Bush helped and encouraged the Venezuelan coup. The fact that mainstream media have aided and abetted George W Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> What is amazing is that few people have seen this film and that few people are aware of the total corruption of the American mass media. Ronald Reagan's elimination of the doctrine of fair play in 1986 took only 20 years to turn America into a blind, rudderless state. <br /> <br /> Let Hugo Chavez open the eyes of patriotic Americans on the truth and beauty of the true American vision.
