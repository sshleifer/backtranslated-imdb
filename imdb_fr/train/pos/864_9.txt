It is surely one of the French films of the decade so far, an atmospheric and tense thriller taking full advantage of the auditory impediment of the main characters to use the sound in a way rarely explored in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos gives a truly amazing multi-faceted performance, sometimes devious and manipulative, sometimes open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offers coming from France.
