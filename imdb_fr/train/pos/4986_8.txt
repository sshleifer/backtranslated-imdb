Lensman is an anime jewel a little less known from Toho and MK studios. It is vaguely based on the novel, but it reminds me more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, check Japanese version with subtitles or just Japanese. The version copied in English was almost truncated and modified to death. <br /> <br /> There is not much new, although it's the first animated feature to combine CG graphics with hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch , However.
