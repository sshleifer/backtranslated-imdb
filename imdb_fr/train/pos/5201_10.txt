The Human Tornado is a 70s Blaxploitation film, featuring nightclub comedian Rudy Ray Moore in his most endearing role to date. The film tells the story of Dolemite, a pawnbroker who gets on the wrong side of a racist white sheriff while sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes and travels to sunny California to visit an old friend, a nightclub owner (and lady of the Dolemite ladies) named Queen Bee. However, it seems that a rival nightclub owner with Mob connections is trying to regain his senses, so Dolemite takes matters into his own hands. Rudy Ray Moore presents many varied talents in this historical film, including strong dramatic talents, a kung fu mastery, an impressive singing voice (he provides two of the songs from the soundtrack), a touching and compassionate side with the ladies and compelling general charisma and keen sense of comic timing. This film has it all, people: a deep plot, a breathtaking action, a funny comedy, beautiful women in distress, a pitiless end ... what more to ask a movie?
