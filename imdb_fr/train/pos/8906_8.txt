Some of these guys who watch movies and complain for a living forget something: the DVD menu system. I tell you people, I watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times. It was great. A cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that pulled me from where he was, which was the very beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I became addicted. Again and again and again. And more. <br /> <br /> "doot dood, dodedo doo." And this is only the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I lie in the bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is in the flat roof and this sweet evening is still sweet. The cat is comfortable and my ankle crossing in me is already rested. I jumped on the DVD. I was hypnotized. In the night "Doot doot, doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> The blob. See him Steve Queen, two cops and a girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
