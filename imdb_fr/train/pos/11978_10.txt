I love the full house so much that I could not live without the full house. Why did it end? It bothers the fans a lot. Can we have a Full House II? Oh, come on! But it's better that we have these DVDs to help us. But I need these truths to propose another new episode. Love, warmth are filled the house! All the characters are very cute and beautiful! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, love it! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse, please return to the screen! How is Michelle after falling from a horse? How are Nicky and Alex doing? Is Joey alone or does he have a wife or at least a girlfriend? Do they still live in the same house? I want to continue the life of full house! and please do not get angry!
