It's an excellent film, it shows what our government will do to other countries if we do not like their government. It's not as bad as what Reagan and Bush number one did in South America, but the United States still has nothing to do with countries like this. This film also proves that the American media throw government propaganda. This is exactly what they did in Aristide, Haiti. The reason this coup against Chavez did not succeed was that Chavez was elected with more than 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be an excellent film a drama, it's amazing that this is true. <br /> <br /> The other criticism when he says "Chavez seizes the airwaves", the private media are constantly organizing an anti-Chavez propaganda.
