The true story of a group of junkies stealing drugs, jewelry, guns and money from a not-so-honest businessman. Some would say that this is the tragic tale of America in the eighties, where the peak of peace and free love of the sixties were devastated by drugs and AIDS. Honestly, they are only ordinary people, aimless in life, who sit up to rise and decide to rob a man without mercy. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have their stuff ... they will sit down and fuck each other again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this film and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make these characters a kind of folk hero, with party scenes and a montage of their booty, is weak and insulting. The story was better with a more direct approach. As it stands, it is a sad story of murders committed by small drug traffickers. The biggest story, for more than one reason, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This film should have been all around him, his life. It is he who is in Wonderland and the wonders that are about to disappear. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although it's not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes' life. It's not entirely factual, but it's a lot nicer.
