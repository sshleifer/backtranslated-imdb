In regions where they overlap, this film is light years away from the Innocence of 2004, which gave the impression of a smoky eye and wheezing peeping young girls. Here, the effect is much more realistic and really penetrates the spirit of the three protagonists as they make their way through a teens full of pitfalls. The three directors, all unknown to me, give very safe performances, of the kind, in fact, which is perhaps so natural that it will be difficult for them to reproduce this quality of play in other films so that I am not not too surprised if they are not heard again. It would be nice if it could come out of art houses and multiplexes where there is just an outside chance that he can "talk" to the bubblegum crowd he is not destined for.
