This is the first Michael Vartan movie I saw (I did not see Alias) and I was curious to see if the guy could play his role. usually in more physical and active roles, so I found her very good and kind in this "sweet" role different from teacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the movie is full of clich√©s and the story does not sound at all. Moreover, even if all the characters of the film notice how similar they are, I do not think there is any screen chemistry there. However, I enjoyed this movie. The places are nice, the characters are nice and beautiful and the support actors are very good. If you expect to see a big romance, that's not it. But if you want to see a nice innocent and innocent movie with nice characters, that's fine.
