First of all, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Beautiful combination of a strange 'dogma' style telling the story with good music and great actors. But unfortunately, there is no "end". For me it is unacceptable. I thought ... how would it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure the 3rd part without Helmer would not be the same. So here is my suggestion. Mayble a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not do a little experience with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create a puppet-driven animation (such as Trey Parker's "Team America") or even 3D computer animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle, I think it could work ... only in this way, it's possible to make the actors alive. For Riget fans, this should not be such a big difference: if the animation is done the right way, an average viewer will consider it normal just after the first shots of the movie. The most important thing is now history. It is quite understandable that it is not possible to create Riget 3 with actors today. So why not play with animation? And ... look for the possibilities this gives you! Even market one! Grand director completes his trilogy after 10 years of puppet animation. Just dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Riget 3 someday ... or even see the script. I'm curious to see how the story ends ... and as I expected, everyone is doing it here. <br /> <br /> greet, slaj <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about Stephen King's "kingdom" hospital ;-)
