First, someone mentioned here that because it was published in "limited" quantities, it means that it SHOULD be bad ... that's exactly what the "big five" Hollywood studios would like the world thinks so that they can "pass" or "ignore" features that are not desirable, without losing face or imagine censoring them directly. to the point, this production has been released "limited" because is considered "unpatriotic" by some individuals. <br /> <br /> now i love this feature; I find it much better than Charlie Wilson's War, even if it's a "fictional" story about something that "never happens," but is always so EVENTUAL. This is for all those who are interested or affected by current US foreign policy, "" or "on board". "turakistan" and "emerald city" undoubtedly try to resemble Iraq and Baghdad, just as the company "Tamerlane" opts for "haliburton" (with vice president Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney, LOL) . quiet moments where the film is DEAD SERIOUS, even more sarcastic (the main example would be how John Cusack's character treats his depression, but not only). <br /> <br /> I found that ALL characters can be related to something / someone or specific stereotypes. now word of advice; if YOU are not politically active, especially with regard to aspects of "globalization", you probably will not appreciate this feature much, since most of its content and "jokes" are aimed at certain "personalities" who are not "visible" to the general public. on a daily basis ... (the main exception would be Hilary Duff who plays the famous pop star materialist, must we say name (S)?). at its core, functionality is an anti-globalization concert, period. the message is unequivocally delivered with a comic revenge. Joan has a sentence that reads as follows: "and here we have a book written by you that know how I conquered the world and solved the problems with my father" .PRICELESS)))) <br /> </ br> > Sister and brother Cusacks play well together, as in "Big PointeBlank", I would say a little more "mature" .Marisa Tomeihere does not show her buttocks and her breasts to "impress" us (as she did recently "Before the devil knows you're dead"), but instead she plays a very serious role and manages to cope well. <br /> <br /> Many critics do not get it (can not do it, or do not want it). This is not a "normal" film but rather a comic documentary. this feature is used to broadcast a message and not to get an Oscar, or to offer "visuals" that encourage the viewer to buy the latest TV "HDTV experience" ... I noticed even in my local newspapers that this film was getting bad-seen because it's not "artistic", while PRO Iraq war movies have the merit of being "balanced" apparently and "endearing". One wonders how much mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a group of guys. .. <br /> <br /> I bet this feature will be a success overseas as much as it will be in North America. As I have already mentioned, it is a satire of American foreign policy and the way it has been hijacked by "special interest" groups ... It is quite insulting that the "ordinary" American soldier bears the logo of the company "Tamerlane" on his battle dress. BUT EFFECTIVE to show reality as it is, or soon will be what will happen so far. <br /> <br /> Some priceless blows: during the "liberation", the country is invaded by commercial advertisements; a hilarious scene of how future journalists will probably gather "news" ("everything must be better than this beef x-box"))); soldiers struggling with their "frustration"; <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not recommend it to "conservative" or "hard core" patriots of any kind. This device is not designed to reach the "spirits of the souls "of the people (as public propaganda and business interests always try to do). Instead, it contains a well-defined message for the realists, and ideological goals seemingly "always" short of achievement.
