This film is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate portraits of the mentality that still seems to have permeated the Balkans 45 years after the time. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love that it is impossible to decide if crying or laughing would be the most appropriate answer. The precision of the representation and the timelessness of the types make it however an excellent film to look if one wants to understand a little what led the former Yugoslavia to its madness. In fact, no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything before seeing this film and his twin, Maratonci trce pocasni krug.
