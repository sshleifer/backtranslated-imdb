Karen goes to a Japanese home as a nurse replacement for Emma, ​​a strange woman who sleeps during the day and wakes up at night. Karen goes up after hearing noises when she meets a scary ghost. She will learn the secrets of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! The scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good. The settings are scary. I like the whole plot! The end was shocking! I stopped on a scene where the boy has meowed so hard to the man who found his sister upstairs and I was shocked. It's the scariest movie I've seen. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
