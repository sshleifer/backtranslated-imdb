Shortly before the imposition of a code of morality darkening the minds of authors, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage" thrilled countless spectators. It has no shocking value today, but a good interpretation. <br /> <br /> While the cast is excellent, this is Bette Davis' first major role and one of Leslie Howard's best performances. Howard is an English Parisian artist, Philip Carey, who is told quietly and firmly that he lacks talent and that his dedication does not replace the true genius. Taking the lesson to heart, he returned to London and enrolled in a medical university (one of them, who seems to have no student, at that time there would have been at least a few. -being that the Maugham Author / Doctor Does Care for Tea One Day Carey is mesmerized by a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a morally unchained and fundamentally naughty farrago role.His Cockney accent is as neat as that of Eliza Doolittle's repeated attempts to go out with her are met with the unenthusiastic "I do not care about that" response, a sure sign for any man whose head is well sunk into the depths. , added to her waitress's advice a bit of old-fashioned street walking, something that was not clearly revealed here. <br /> <br /> Carey's prostration meets Rogers' proven need in financial support, it is necessary to desperately in love with her - she plays him like a Sunday church organist who plays effortlessly with his instrument. No sex here. Recognizing that he's not going anywhere, he begins a chaste relationship with Norah, a woman who adores her. Go back to Mildred, filled with a baby and who has the usual need to be cared for. Get out Norah, broken heart. <br /> <br /> Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-time friendship with Sally, enthusiastically encouraged by her father who seems to regard the eventual marriage as a good thing for both youngsters and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine children. <br /> <br /> The film reasonably follows Maugham's excellent novel. Howard's Carey is na√Øve and vulnerable, and for the most part, his sad eyes are like a doe's face to a double-barreled shotgun. Mildred is mean-spirited, a worst-case user, she barely cares about her needs when she tries to calm Carey with a fine patina of loving words (and offers at one point, she promises to do anything [he wants] , a bold statement for the time and which, I am sure, perfectly understands the public. <br /> <br /> That might be the case, but the quick dissolution of Mildred would have satisfied the League of Catholic Decency. The end is conventional: sin loses, the behavior is based on principles. <br /> <br /> Director John Cromwell has achieved excellent performances for his two main stars, one well established and the other The 1930s London atmosphere and time travel are worth it. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for representations of Davis and Howard)
