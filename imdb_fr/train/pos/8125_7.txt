Things to come is this rarity of rarities, a movie about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few try to show us how this future was built. The first part of the film, when the war comes to Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, the movie's audience of the year of its release mocked rumors that enemy planes would have attacked England - appeasement was at its height.) Wells' prediction was confirmed too early.) The mounting of the endless war that ensues, overshadowed by model work, is the most effective. The explanatory titles strongly recall the expressionist German graphic design. The artistic director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his sets of Everytown's ruins are some of his best works. Margaretta Scott is very attractive as the chef's mistress. Every 21st century city is an equally striking project. The 21st century scenario is not convincing - it may be a failed attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of that time with the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately, the working model, representing angry crowds rushing in the raised walkways, is ridiculously bad and could have been done much better, even with 30s technology. This is particularly infuriating, as the scenes of the giant apparatus are very convincing. This is the story of the magnificent speech by Raymond Massey concluding the film - the ideal of scientific progress has rarely been so well expressed. Massey's last question is more relevant than ever, in a time of extremely small inhabited space flights. The scene is helped by the catchy music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose family name I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have published a pretty interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that leads us from 1970 to 2038. I hope that a good DVD exists of all the film.
