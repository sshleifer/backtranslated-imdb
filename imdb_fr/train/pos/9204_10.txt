The story of Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, actually came to Dev Anand's mind when he saw the hippies and their fallen values ​​in Kathmandu where he was visiting after protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was in a bad mood because his film had been opposed and some had burned Prem Pujari's posters. But the life of the hippies allowed Dev to turn a story into a movie. <br /> <br /> It was perhaps the best director effort of Dev Anand. The film was a box office hit and Zeenat Aman as Dev's sister had a huge impact. <br /> <br /> This film was Dev Anand's call to the nation to uphold its moral values. <br /> <br /> This is an Indian family based in Montereal and the role of the brother is very affectionate for his sister. But the parents argue and separate, leaving Prashant (Dev) with his mother and Jasbir (Zeenat) with his father. She is told repeatedly that her mother and brother are dead and she ends up believing she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is abused by her stepmother and she runs away from home. Dev grows as a pilot and learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with some hippies. <br /> <br /> To meet with her sister, Dev goes to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz), who was to marry her. also Janice who is actually Jasbir with a new name and a new identity. She also forgot about her childhood and Dev. <br /> <br /> Dev must find his sister among all the events, including that of being suspected of being a thief in Kathmandu, and people want after his life. <br /> <br /> It was a story well directed and interpreted by Dev Anand. We see more Zeenat Aman than Mumtaz. But the music of Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev first proposed that the music be composed by Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da did not want Dev to make the film. He was very close to Dev and his previous film Prem Pujari, although he was good, but he had opposed Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject, thinking that the hippie cult film could revive people's anger at Dev. But Dev continues with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film is a success. <br /> <br /> R D Burman asked Asha Bhosle to sing the award-winning film Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good figure. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie.
