A fantastic Arab adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Black Narcissus' Sabu) are looking for Ahmad's love interest, which was stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is hardly a moment of inactivity here. It's always inventing new adventures for heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring (needless to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, is a big bad guy. Sabu is very entertaining as a prince of thieves who, at one point, finds a genie in a bottle. I also loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the princess's father. He collects incredible toys from around the world. Jaffar pays him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. It would probably be one of the best children's movies of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. Children will certainly make fun of superimposed images when Abu and Genius are on the screen together. And the scene with the giant spider is particularly awful. Although most younger generations probably think that King Kong looks bad at this time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a rope-tied puppet that does not even look like a spider. 8/10.
