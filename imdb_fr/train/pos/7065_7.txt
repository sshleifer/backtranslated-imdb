Nice film about three dynamic Swiss sisters (often seen in matching outfits) who want to be reunited with their parents (it seems mom is still carrying the torch for daddy) - so they have gone to New York to prevent the father from marry a blond gold digger he calls "Precious". Dad has not seen his daughters for ten years, they (curiously) do not seem to care and find him wonderful, and during this time, Precious seems to lead a life mainly led by his dominant mother (Alice Brady), a woman who wants to see her daughter marry a rich man. The sisters have the idea to push Precious into the skin of a drunken Hungarian count, prompting the two women who are looking for gold to believe he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of mistaken identity reminds girls that the count is beautiful, Ray Milland, who accepts the ploy, because he has a crush on his sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This film is nice, light. . Barbara Read while Kay looks sweet and pretty, Ray Milland looks so young and handsome here (though, sadly, we give her little to do), Alice Brady is very good as an intriguing mother - but she is Deanna Durbin, a real charmer and cute as a button playing the younger sister Penny, who steals pretty much the limelight. With an absolutely beautiful voice, she sings several songs throughout the film, although I would have really liked to see them describe it even more. The plot in this movie is a little silly, but I still found the film entertaining and entertaining.
