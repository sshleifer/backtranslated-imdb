The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric has made a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Far superior to "The Grifters", which was a good film, this film has remained true to the roots of the pulp fiction / film noir whose story is based. I recommend this movie to all movie fans.
