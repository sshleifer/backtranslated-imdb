There are people who claim that it is another Mexican film "ultra-violent", very violent. They are right, but more than that, this film is a call to raise awareness of what we have become. The terrible truth hurts or is boring when you have already accepted the paradigm of living the Third World as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of "Cero y van cuatro" is the open invitation to a deep reflection on our present identity. Is this what we all are? Is this all we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how much the Mexican society was spoiled when the Tlahuac incident was revealed. I still do not understand the viewers who are witnessing a mass murder. I almost vomited when I saw some of the pictures. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, but just a small village near Mexico City when the rampage was committed with the indulgence of the media and the government. The recreation of a similar situation in this film deeply shocked me. The other stories described many other situations of corruption, dishonesty, treason and violence, but I consider that "Tamales de Chivo" is the best. <br /> <br /> The film is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" screams. These do not mean anything about the actions of the people. With few exceptions, these are all perfect examples of human garbage. As in real life, honesty becomes more an exception than the rule in our country. Moreover, honesty is rewarded only miraculously.
