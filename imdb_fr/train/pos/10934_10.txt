After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say that it has lost none of its mysticism or its captivating martial art action, as I had remembered in my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his "unfinished" student to look for the 5 former members of his Poison clan, so that they do not seek a fortune that the master's friend keeps hidden. Fearing that his last student did not have enough training, he asked him to befriend one of the five "venoms" in order to defeat the other four. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about choreography or camera work. A beautiful film in its own right and probably one of the best martial arts movies ever made. A CLASSIC!!
