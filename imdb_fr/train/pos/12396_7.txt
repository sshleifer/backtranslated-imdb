This is the second part of "The Animatrix", a collection of animated shorts that tell a little more about the world of "The Matrix". <br /> <br /> In this document, we learn how humans and machines could not work and live together. This is a little history lesson in the world of 'The Matrix'. Not as good as the first part ("The last flight of the Osiris") but still very fun.
