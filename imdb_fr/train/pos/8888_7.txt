This film started slowly, then picked up speed in the middle. However, the fact that the film lasted two nights broke this momentum at its peak. The second part really became interesting, but then gave way to a merely pathetic ending. Playing football in the yard? Really, could it be more sappy and maudlin? Now, I hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70s. I will not make much effort to tune in that one if it looks like "The 60s".
