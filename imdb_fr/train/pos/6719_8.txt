I like this movie because it's a good movie job, done by people who care enough about doing art and not just home movies. It's filled with home movies by super-surfer Greg Noll and many amateur videos that rally around his 50-year-old passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to the point of approaching aesthetic glory. He is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent, even if you think that surfing is athletic. Surfers are neither astronauts nor test pilots. Nor are they surgeons (maybe) or Ph.Ds (again, maybe). He believes in the surfer's quest. He believes in the beauty of human clumsiness. He believes in the great gift of peace that stems from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the end of the war on the north beach of a Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. He celebrates the downtime of a country that waged a cold war against Russian socialists instead of a hot war. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It's dangerous, but not very historical. I think that Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer dozens of countries to get the favorable press he received. This film has no military heroes. He does not have guns. The only conquered beach-head surfers have a beer kiosk and a surf shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not hopeless. It is the joy of expiration.
