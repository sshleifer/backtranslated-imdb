Besides planes, trains and cars and Uncle Buck, it's the funniest movie of John Candy. When he is hypnotized with the playing card (similar to the Manchu candidate) and becomes an excited guy who does not know what he says, he makes two very memorable quotes (both deal with male anatomy). The love scene featuring groceries needs to be seen, it can not be described. <br /> <br />
