One of the most sensible comedies to hit Hindi movie screens. Malayalam, a remake of the hit Priyadarshans of the 80s, hit Boeing Boeing, who was in turn a remake of the sixties hit Hollywoon of the same name, Garam Masala raises the level of comedies in Hindi cinema. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has once again proved that he is one of the best super stars of Hindi cinema capable of comedy. He combined well with the new song John Abraham. However, John still remains in the shadow of Akshays and fails to seize the opportunity. <br /> <br /> The new girls are cute and do justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> A comedy not to be missed. Leave your brains out and laugh for 2 hours !!!! After all, laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
