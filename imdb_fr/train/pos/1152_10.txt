The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to rekindle the weakened minds of Sally alone is reason enough to enjoy this film, but wait! There is more! It's a good crackling show of daytime TVs, movie stars coming down, and horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius and Cathy Moriarty is splendid. The dialogue is spiritual and the physical humor is done with irreproachable skill. It is a film that will appeal to those who love the performing arts, staging and writing.
