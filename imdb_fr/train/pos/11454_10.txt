As a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while and owning some of his books, I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something completely satisfying and much more than I expected. Being an artist myself (I work in clay), it's imperative to find inspiration in our environment to create good works of art, and that's something that Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. After a year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, skills and dedication that the artist has with nature to create a whimsical and inspiring connection. The film's music is enveloping and intoxicating. If you are an artist lacking inspiration or if you need a rewarding experience, then SEE THIS FILM. For my part, I'm happy to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Create, dance, fight with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
