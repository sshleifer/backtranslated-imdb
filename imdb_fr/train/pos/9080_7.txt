I may need my head to be examined, but I thought it was a very good movie. The CG is not too bad. I've seen worse. The look of creatures (and by creatures, I mean good and bad snake) was I thought the action scenes with the snakes were really good. There are sometimes logical errors, and history does not always make sense. But for a creature function, there is much worse. the other creatures seemed from other movies, so it's not quite original.I think most of the story is original.There is a bit of similarity with Godzilla (the American version with big budget ) who liked it a lot. I like this movie, but I always say it was pretty good. I also liked the music. In short, I think Dragon Wars is a 7/10
