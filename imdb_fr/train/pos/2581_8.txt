People are too hard for the film. Sometimes we should just sit down and enjoy the story without trying to "re-read" it. <br /> <br /> Everything happens when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still falls. The party begins as everyone around him begins to "go down". <br /> <br /> Just think of JFK and anyone associated in any way with his assassination. what is involved in this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's an excellent interpretation of what might have happened. The EXACT story may not have been followed (in retrospect after reading Jim Maars' "Crossfire"), but that's the interesting thing that's of particular interest. <br /> <br /> I would like to get a copy. see again. In light of what we know today, the Domino principle is quite accurate.
