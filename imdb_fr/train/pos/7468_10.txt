As the summary of a line indicates, two films left me such a comment when I left the theater. One was "Stir of Echoes" with Kevin Bacon and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you sit in the back of the theater and you do not think about anyone around you, stop wondering what will be the end of the film and let the film film quickly where you want it ... going out of the cinema was a bit strange, like that feeling you get when you're sick and you can not think of anything. One of those films that are one with the guy and feel that nothing moves around you except what it contains. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. The actors are great, the soundtrack is excellent and everything in the film is over 9 years old. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the film that woke up the best and most shocking about my life and purpose in this world.
