Well-filmed film of suspense, well played and well scripted. Had me on the edge of my seat. I loved the lead actress and found the villain was very well done. There is not much to say about the theme, but if you sit down, if you turn away from the brain, look at the fancy camera and enjoy the plot, you'll have a great time. The plot is well used, and moviegoers will probably know more or less what to expect in about ten minutes. But that did not bother me, because I liked watching the movie unfold. Previously, they may not have focused on two characters and there were interesting times when I hoped they would let a few people have a few lines. But these people were probably right to keep the film so focused. The plot took me by the throat quite early and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. because I'm not sure that makes much sense. Sit down and enjoy.
