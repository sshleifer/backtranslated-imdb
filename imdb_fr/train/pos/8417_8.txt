Although the style of this film is not as sober and realistic as a sound version probably would have been, it's still a very good movie. In fact, it was considered an excellent film in his day, as he was nominated for the first Oscar for best film (defeated by WINGS). I still consider WINGS as a superior film, but this one is excellent despite a little overaction on the part of the leader, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general of Tsarist Russia who is living his last days. earn a few dollars in the 1920s by becoming an extra Hollywood. His luck seems to have changed as a result of a casting call: playing the role of an imperial Russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution. Of course, it's not really difficult to act on an acting basis, but it also makes the old man think about the good old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> I'll leave you exactly what will happen next, but it's a great movie - especially at the end. By the way, look for William Powell as a Russian director. Although it was manufactured in 1928, it does not look much younger than in many of its subsequent films.
