Having had the opportunity to watch part of the film shot in the Slavic village area of ​​Broadway, I was eager to see his final copy. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie at the Prime Minister of Cleveland last Friday, I did not laugh aloud in a comedy in a long time! It's great slapstick. The Russo brothers worked well. All the cast plays its best comic role ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he is great as a cripple breaker in this movie. William H. Macy, the rogue "Riley", and Michael Jeter, "Toto", keep you in "stitches". I think they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
