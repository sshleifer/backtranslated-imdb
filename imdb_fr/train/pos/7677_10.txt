Wow, this movie had a huge impact on me, it moved me. It's an incredible story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold in the sex trade. I can not help but think about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The frame of the film is realistic. The film was a revelation. I can not imagine anyone moving away from it without wanting to help evolve this appalling problem that exists. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very moving. It was one of the best movies I saw this year. The girl <br /> <br /> who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film moved me to tears, It tells an important message that must be heard around the world. Everyone should go see this movie. I think this movie will make the difference, I loved it!
