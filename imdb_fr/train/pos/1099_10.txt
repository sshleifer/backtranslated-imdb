Although recognized as the best film treatment difficulties to build (or buy) a house in the country according to your specifications, this is neither the first nor the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were the main actors in the film version of GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE comedy by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And about fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks took the lead of THE MONEY PIT. The first involved moving into an 18th century country house that needed work. The latter was about to build the house of your dreams - in the late 1980s. Although both films have their moment, they are not as good as BLANDINGS, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the tight nooks of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters, Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising manager (in 1948, he earned $ 15,000 a year, which was $ 90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxury apartment - that he rents in New York that day! - He thinks they should look for something better. He and Muriel drive to Connecticut and quickly find an old ruin that, they both think, can be converted into the home of their dreams. <br /> <br /> And both fall into the financial pitfall buying land and building can lead to. On the one hand, they are so fanatical about the idea of ​​building a house like this that they ignore warning after their wise, if cousin friend and lawyer, lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a nicely sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, sucking his chops quietly), with a check before checking the correct cost for the land in this part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land he is worth. There are water supply issues that both Blanding simply do not think of, like the hard, soft water that leads to the Zis - Zis water softening machine. They discover that the designs they have in mind and that they developed with their architect (Reginald Denny) can not be abandoned cheaply, while Muriel decided to build a small settlement that no one had planned. <br /> <br /> Increasing project costs are a concern for Jim. He was appointed to manage the "Wham" account ("Spam" had become a popular result of the Second World War, in that the public was beginning to use it as a meat substitute, in light of its success with armies). Jim can not control this (he is not alone - one or two other executives have searched in front of him). It comes with the following piece of "poetry" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little pig went to the market, <br /> <br /> It was pink and as pretty as ham. Br /> <br /> He smiled, <br /> <br /> As they gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew he would eventually become "Wham"! <Br /> <br /> His secretary looks at him as if he needed a jacket right to read it! <br /> <br /> Jim is more and more suspicious of Bill's attention to Muriel, though (in this case) Bill is flawless. But he's still here (Jim keeps forgetting that Bill is the one with the clear mind and keeps Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have problems, the best being to be locked in a half-built room, just as the men left for the day. They can not open the door and Jim (panicked) tries to break the door with a makeshift ram. He breaks a window and the door opens alone. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, all the actors apparently having fun. It is a film that (despite changing price levels and salary levels) does not age at all. After all, most Americans dream of owning their own home and still having it. <br /> <br /> Several years ago, a painting company had taken advantage of a charming scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell about the painting work of the Parnell company doing on the different rooms. She carefully displays the distinct shades of red, blue, and so on. she wants - even giving Parnell polite a single thread to get the right shade of blue. Advertisements suggested that the painting company had a wide variety of colors for its painting work. They proudly called Loy "Mrs. Blandings" in the introduction of the commercials. However, you can imagine how Parnell, a sensible man, manages the situation later, when Loy leaves him with his painting team.
