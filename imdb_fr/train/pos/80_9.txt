I really enjoyed the reunion! I would have noticed if they had had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". It was not even mentioned where they are today or why they did not attend the meeting. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to explain their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was happy that TNN is running the series again! I was looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to record the whole series (it may be that I missed some episodes). Jenny Hanahan
