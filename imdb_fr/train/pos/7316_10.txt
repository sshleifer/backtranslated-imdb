This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is remarkable, the music is as good as the movie and the murderer is as terrifying as possible! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you have been fantastic as Dr. Loomis, he made the film even better. Without him, he would miss an essential ingredient in the film. Jamie Lee Curtis is as beautiful as our beloved queen of cry! Her innocence makes her unconscious of the real evil that awaits her until she finds her friends slaughtered in the house, which is of course one of the best scenes of the film. She gives an extraordinary performance. I loved this movie because it made me very scared when I saw it in the early 80s and I still watch it today because it's a wonderful film that immerses you in this world where you could be defeated like a fish. at every turn! The fact that it is a simple mask of mad madman who escaped from a mental asylum and is ready to kill everyone in sight without him having any idea of ​​its existence, is terribly terrifying and plunges you even further into the film like events if the fiction could easily have come true. We all know that, unfortunately, evil exists in this world and that a crazy man with a knife is certainly not rare, it is a very worrying fear for all this. Death at any moment. Halloween, of course, shows this in the most terrifying way. The horror should be credible, and that's what makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is transformed into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. In addition to the great storyline of Psycho, which I love both, I believe that their formats are the best of horrors. Halloween and Psycho are for me the best films I have ever seen and I will watch them all my life without ever getting bored. Halloween is without a doubt one of the best movies of all time.
