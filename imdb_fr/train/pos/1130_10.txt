"Iphigenia" is the great success of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterful piece is masterfully adapted to the screen and animated by a magnificent cast. Cacoyannis realized the impossible. He managed to film a Greek tragedy without losing efficiency and importance. A stellar Greek distribution helps him that. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive in the role of Iphigenia. Irene Papas is equally impressive. Although it sometimes seems exaggerated, it is very realistic. A wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent score by Mikis Theodorakis, ideal in all scenes. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say the film has lost the best foreign language film Oscar by only 1 vote !!!
