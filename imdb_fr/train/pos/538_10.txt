Returning to the lakeside cottage is perhaps one of the few suites at the height of the original. There was black humor, good suspense, pretty girls and, of course, a psycho killer. What are we missing? I do not think anything. Except that we only have a small amount of gore and nudity left because it was made for television. In addition to being one of the best suites, it is one of the best thrillers to watch in family. Recommended for everyone.
