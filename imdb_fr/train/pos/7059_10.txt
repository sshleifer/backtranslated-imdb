I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web. I thought Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) was a very cute and fun suite for everyone - kids and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find it and the movie is very informative, it shows lessons about being true to yourself and following your heart. I thought the animation was excellent and the voice was very good; the songs performed by Brooke Allison too. Since this film was divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite story is the story of Jaq the mouse, who became human for a day, thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic.
