The previous comment said it exactly. I saw it once, I was delighted, I saw it a second time when it was rebroadcast a week or two after the first broadcast. I still remember some scenes. The beginning of the war is the beginning of the twentieth century. The war mentioned in the title is the First World War. One of the scenes was in a women's section of a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment when one of the women touches each other is one of my best moments ever at the movies. I do not think of it as a "gay movie", it's an interesting and tender love story, where the two directors are women. I would love to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it came out on DVD.
