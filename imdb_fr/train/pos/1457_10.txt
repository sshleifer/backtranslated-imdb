I've watched this documentary twice - and while I'm a big movie lover, most documentaries do not catch my attention. This film was fascinating though. Almost every shot is perfect - much more than an audio commentary (which this documentary does not have). <br /> <br /> The concept of this film is incredible, I can only rent it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> Choice of amazing and excellent interviews - film footage of a factory in China - the film gives the impression of being really there. <br /> <br /> I am a politician - and I have read several books on globalization, so nothing in this film has surprised me. However, it made me think a lot. <br /> <br /> I also wish that this world is a better place. <br /> <br /> A million congratulations to the filmmaker - and thank you for making this film as well. <br /> <I would like everyone to see it.
