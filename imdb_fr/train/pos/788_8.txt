Ok - I admit it. I think Kenny Doughty looks awesome in this film - but beyond his beauty, the film is carried by an intrigue that is sometimes predictable, but reasonable. <br /> <br /> We begin by presenting the three main women of the film. A director - very worried about her image and never married. A police officer - with a child and a bad ex to continue. The third - a doctor hungry for power and status with a desire for recognition and three elders. <br /> <br /> They are almost the "first women's club" and, in fact, there is a lot of verbal retaliation between the ex and some "he left the credit card" behavior. Defined characters - the movie continues. <br /> <br /> McDowell's character, the director, arrives late for a funeral - a young organist replacing the regular player (Doughty) draws her. What are her two friends going to say about the evil that ensues? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A cloth or two recommended if you're the type in tears - the inspiring end, but maybe not what you expect. Overall, it's a great movie that stands out among the current choices in action, special effects and horror.
