"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I do not understand why this movie did not have better reviews, it's funny, harmless and sweet. I watched it for the first time, when I was 11 years old, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Until today, I showed it to a lot of friends and they all liked it. but no one knew the movie before. I think that's the problem, almost nobody knows, so almost no one can love it ... This movie has never had a real chance, it's sad, "IF" really has the potential to a comedy like "Monsters Inc." . "or" Spaceballs. "Ok, enough dissatisfaction - What I really wanted to say is that, if you ever want to laugh, look at it! Even if you do not get angry, it's worth a look! -> Get ready to laugh, scum!
