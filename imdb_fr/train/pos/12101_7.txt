I remember seeing this movie at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky as a child. The scene where Dr. Carmus discovered the gardener's coffin and the breathing corpse was the scariest part of the film for me, intensified only by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end, until I recognized the part of the film in which the Blackwood family name was changed from Blackblood, because in the history of the family, there was a character known for his numerous hangings of various people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to have trouble adding weight to the deaths caused by his family. I also noticed that when Foster enters the cemetery door for the first time, he makes sure that he does not lose sight of the sharp object of the door, where he reaches his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
