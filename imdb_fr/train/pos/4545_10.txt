I saw this movie recently. Two hours later, I still had a headache from laughing. The plot was really horrible, the jokes were too bad, but I was not counting on: <br /> <br /> 1. the 2 scenes before and after the movie where Pat and Jay posed (which caused a lot of laughter) <br /> <br /> 2. Kick through the windshield that decapitated the perpetrator. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with a disclamer that says if you do not like the movie, send the certificate to HBO. While I was thinking about it, the date you had to send it was in January 1991 (which also provoked madness).
