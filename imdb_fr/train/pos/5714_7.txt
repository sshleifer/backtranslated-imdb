I was so excited to see this movie because I had always heard it was very scary. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is that it's a Japanese movie that they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it IN Japan with the crew of 'origin! I think it made the movie more Japanese (that's probably why it was quite successful, unlike most Japanese-American horror flops), but it also made it a little inaccessible to the public. American. The difference between what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture has been present throughout the film. It worked well in moments when they wanted to capture the main character's nervous fear: a frightened fish in a big, busy and unknown pond in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The plot was also quite confusing. In typical Japanese fashion, it's extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the film is actually the middle of the story and from there we move on and back constantly until, at the end of the film, we see the end and the beginning of the story. This constant passage in time was very confusing for me. Moreover, I did not think that some things were so well explained and I had to ask a friend to explain them to me (she had already seen them, as well as the sequel that apparently reveals more of the story). <br /> <br /> Overall, the American public has a lot to like, tons of phantasmagorical images and macabre details that make up a good dose of jump scenes.
