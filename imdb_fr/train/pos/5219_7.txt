Gere and Danes play two Ministry of Public Safety employees to track sex offenders released. Gere, who plays Babbage, calls them his flock. Gere is an obsessed activist who is about to go out. He is training, newcomer Allison, to take office. Gere sees his flock of puppies very sick and disturbed. He asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. He continues to be warned of this behavior, hence the reason he is replaced. During the last days of her work, a girl is missing and Babbage is convinced that one of her flocks has gone astray. He and Allison reduce a list and discover that some of the offenders have disappeared. So he decides he has to find the missing girl rather than help the police. This part is a bit far-fetched. <br /> <br /> This movie contains sick and twisted stuff. For example, when Babbage and Allison visit this building where a crowd of sick people are bothering. In addition, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see what are the sick monsters. However, I would not say that this film is excessive, because the film does not show much. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If you like thrillers and movies about serial killers and cops chasing assassins, then you'll like this.
