Sophmoric this movie is. But it's funny because everyone is coming out. This shows the "boys' cloakroom mentality" played by "the other side". It is good to see such tides turn and how stupid they are. But this is probably not news for most women, because (ask one), "they've heard them all before". <br /> <br /> Watch them with a small group or 97.3% of the party will laugh for 2 hours in a row. And the other 2.7% ... can you really like them?
