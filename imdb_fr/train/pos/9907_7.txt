"Slaughter High" is perhaps the most underrated movie of the 1980s. It's one of the few movies of its kind to be captivating. That being said, it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women are killed one by one terribly until the final showdown. <br /> <br /> The reason "Slaughter High" is above most movies of its kind is that it goes over the head. Marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his old classmates. They electrocuted him while he was standing naked in the shower of a girl's cloakroom, pricking himself in the crotch with a javelin and, to top it off, rigged his scientific laboratory experience to disfigure him. the victims of this film are about as bad as you are. When they meet years later - at a high school meeting organized by Marty himself - you will realize that they have not matured much yet. They are a band of sociopaths. <br /> <br /> It is bewildering not to wonder why they were the only ones to come to the meeting, which is taking place in a school that has since fallen into ruin. And who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and alcoholic beverages found in the abandoned building in a room with their old lockers - as well as Marty's? The viewer must have a lot of confidence to enjoy this movie. The end makes little sense. And the writers have a strange understanding of how April Fool's Day works: the movie says jokes are no longer allowed after noon. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is one of the best examples of the genre slasher, despite all its flaws. It is hard to understand why he has not found his way to the DVD yet, while so many other classic films have special editions.
