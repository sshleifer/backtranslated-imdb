This is not a bad movie. He follows the new conventions of modern horror, namely the movie within a movie, the well-known actress who runs for his life in the first scene. This film takes the old convention of the psychopathic killer and manages to do something new and interesting with it. It's also nice to see Molly Ringwald again for the attack. <br /> <br /> This is an example of what the genre has become. Cutting hits all the marks, and scares in some parts. I liked I gave him an eighth.
