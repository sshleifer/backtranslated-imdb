A bit typical of the filmmaking of this era. Obviously, it was first conceived in this world for the stage, but nevertheless a very good film from the beginning to the end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York play their role for the big screen and both do it effectively. There are very few stories in history, and those unfamiliar with this type of quirky study can be a bit offended by this. All in all, a good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York have too much to do.
