Some war films succeed where others do not, and that can be judged from different angles. The humanistic angle, the one where you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being attacked, the camaraderie among the soldiers, the painful trials they face during the fighting, etc.) are always films that I find convincing. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies for which you feel connected to the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film also succeeds at this level. He speaks of "the highest distinction" and this honor does the right thing. These 23 soldiers did what was right, they had the honor and it is recognized in a way that is totally incompatible with Western thought, but it is, until the end, a true story of honor. Unforgettable film. Based on a real story.
