I voted 8 for this film because of some minor childish faults. Apart from that, this movie is one of my favorites! It's fun, to say the least. The shooting scenes are, however, ridiculous, and I think Gackt (the author of the book) uses his "Matrix obsession" too much. It seems like their enemies are just standing there ... waiting to be fired. However, this film is touching and always makes me cry. There is a lot of humor, so it makes me laugh too. Gackt is a superb actor, I must say .. he shows so much emotion. It was the first time Hyde had played and he was doing well. The role suits him well. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. The whole cast is what I would say, perfect for this movie. DO NOT LACK IT! YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET IT!
