A good idea: 11 stories on September 11th. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talking about an immigrant (as usual) is just awesome (as usual). The Frenchman is doing a very good job too, while the film about Burkina Faso was a good surprise. However, the Israeli film was a little boring, and the Mexican should stop directing and working in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
