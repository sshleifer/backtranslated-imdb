Saturday a Saturday, a few years ago, for various reasons, I do not remember the whole story, but there are only two outstanding performances of the main characters. Dom had an unfortunate spell, manipulated and literally working a dirt job, Eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty to his brother or sister. Tom Hulce 'Dom does not plead for sympathy - it comes naturally. Ray Liotta is a distant universe of Henry Hill, displaying a soft center. What must be felt as an ungrateful position. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this question addresses the dilemma faced by many young caregivers - past or future. It turns out that with a little work, both can happily coexist. Dominick & Eugene plays with sensitivity and plays sensitively. It's hard not to be fooled.
