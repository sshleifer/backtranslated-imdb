One of these beautifully intense films that draws us so intimately far, it ends a lot soon! He then remained watching the screen as "No, they did not do it!", Lol. Good performances all around! The acting is wonderful with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew she would give a solid and convincing performance, capturing the regality, temperament and vulnerability of young Victoria throughout the film. In addition, the production is remarkable in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable insight into a remarkable moment in the history of Britain, told through a very personal and touching biography of the princess of school age until her reign as queen, later marrying Prince Albert, before to end the birth of their first child of nine children. There was a well-written script and flawless editing. Rupert Friend as a young prince Albert, still patient and compassionate, fighting over the young queen's attention before getting his love, before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) looks at her. The relationship between teenager Victoria and her mother, who was sometimes furious, was as captivating as that between her mother and King William (who also hated his mother). The game and the scenes were captivating, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing at that time and, in fact, to all those who love a fascinating and true love story
