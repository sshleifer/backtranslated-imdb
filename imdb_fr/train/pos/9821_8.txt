I saw this movie on True Movies (which automatically made me skeptical) but in fact it was good. Why? Not because of incredible twists or breathtaking dialogues (of which there are few things), but because in reality, despite what people say, I thought the film was true to her description of teenage girls confronted with a pregnancy. Dawson's Creek are not graceful, witty characters who cross sexuality with effortless knowledge. They are children and they act like children. <br /> <br /> They are dull, awkward and confused in an annoying way about everything. Yes, it could be an accident and they could be bad actors but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (without wanting to be cool) a very believable performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette is mourning and annoying, but she was pregnant and teenager? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable and so what? I believed them, his stress and his inability to cope - his brave but slightly mistaken attempts to bring them together. I think that the characters, interpreted by someone else, would have been boring and unbelievable, but they were not. It reflects the surreality of the situation they are in, sitting in class and walking around the campus with the baby. I felt angry at her for that, I got angry at him for being such a child and blaming her. I felt everything. <br /> <br /> Finally, I liked it and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Dermot Mulroney escapes from the disastrous counseling session - professional performance.
