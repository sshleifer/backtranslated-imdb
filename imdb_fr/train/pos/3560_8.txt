We do not remember today Joseph L. Mankiewicz as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves he is. Mankiewicz has already been successful in making sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve and successfully adapting Shakespeare to the life of Julius Caesar. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even if he can not sing too much. He is the only actor to be able to get along with his calm and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and his scenes with Brando sizzle with excellent chemistry. All the supporting actors play their part, especially Sheldon Leonard in the role of Harry the Horse in a very funny role. Nevertheless, Mankiewicz should be given the essential merit of having presented a beautiful musical on screen so that it feels authentic in many scenes while remaining a story in his own world. Overall, Guys and Dolls is an excellent musical that works on many levels that it should not normally have.
