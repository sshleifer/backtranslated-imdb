At the first release of DEATHTRAP, the poster - reproduced on the cover of this DVD - offered a graphic close to the Rubik's cube. This is an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who wrote memorable works such as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters and was translated very well on the screen. . <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that is very difficult to discuss, because doing it in detail details the very plot for which it is famous. But the opening premise is extremely intelligent: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mysteries, but lately he seems to have lost the hand. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him the script of a play he wrote. His name is "Deathtrap" and Sidney recognizes it as a real success. Just the kind of tube that would boost his career ... a success to die. And when Clifford comes to the room to discuss the play, the events suddenly begin to change as unexpectedly as possible. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer, SLEUTH is just as sinuous, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on the stage than on the screen - to reach its full power, it needs the immediacy offered by a live performance. Nevertheless, under the advice of director Sidney Lumet, the screen is more than respectable. This is largely due to the distribution, which is remarkably good. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and endearing as Sidney's anxious and relentless wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what could be the best performance of his career, unfortunately, short-lived. If you can not see it in a theatrical production of the highest order, it will not happen until you see it. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
