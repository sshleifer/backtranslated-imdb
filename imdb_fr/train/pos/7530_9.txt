It's kind of a sequel to Batman the animated and that's about as good as it's for and for all the same reasons, it has a lot of action in the script, it's good, voiceover actors are really good, like Kevin Conroy as a batman, Mark Hamil as a Joker, etc. The bad guys are really good like The Joker, Two-faced, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So, I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman, because very well. So be sure to watch it on TV, rent it or buy it, because it's really good. <br /> <br /> General note: ********* on ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** on *****
