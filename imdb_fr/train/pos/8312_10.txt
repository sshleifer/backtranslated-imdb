The life and time of Little Richard, told by Little Richard, as produced and directed by Little Richard, was about as one-sided as one of his songs. It's not a biography or even a docudrama, but it has good writing, great energy and an outstanding lead actor playing Richard. All the music is from Little Richard, so it resonates on all the songs. <br /> <br /> The film tells of his early childhood, tells the formative years of music, the resounding success and abandonment of Richard. praise the Lord. Everything is well connected and the obvious return in 1962 manages to stay out of the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles, who opened it for him. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that his outrageous anti-cultural behavior is minimized and you have no idea how his audience experienced it at that time. Part of his energy, which he always has, is not total. He seemed tame, compared to what I remember him at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are those of Richard being pissed off by Lucille and writing a song about it, as well as the strip in bikini shorts during the execution, to Tell them they do not have no decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they entered the "Bronze Liberace" as Richard called in the interviews, there is a story. Believe me, I just saw him play a few months ago and he always flirts with the pretty white boys, giving the one who is particularly good in the public, his headband. Almost 68 years old and still in shape, I recommend this film and all the concerts or television appearances that you can find. Little Richard is still on
