My friends and I were discussing our frustration with the way in which movies and especially romantic comedies are made. We feel offended by the blockage that Hollywood is serving these days, as they act as if everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Well, everything is not going well ... except for a few bright spots, like this movie. He does not have the big actors, the big budget, I do not think he had a major release (I rented at Hollywood Video), he really had nothing that most romantic comedies to big budget have. <br /> <br /> But he had what most of those who miss. There was a great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was not imposed on us like so many others. The director took his time to allow these characters to really know each other. Their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> The support cast has added not only really funny comic moments, but also a depth to the story. The character of James LeGros was absolutely invaluable. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his colleagues in a psychic helpline was very amusing. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how nice it is to fall in love.
