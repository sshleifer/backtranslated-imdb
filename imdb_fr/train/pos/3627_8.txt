What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a movie from sappy kids and found that I enjoyed it more than my teenage years. Take a tissue paper, it's not sad, just "move" by parts. Finally, it is a film of "well-being" for the whole family. Note: It is over 2 hours, so consider leaving the smaller squirmers at home. AP
