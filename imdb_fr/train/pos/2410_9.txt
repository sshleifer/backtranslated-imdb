This film is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen. He does not try to tell the whole story, but only to represent an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is a dark, playful and seriously faithful to elements of the Jewish tradition and to the modern interpretation of the Scriptures. Judas is much more ordinary than other representations, not the dark and sinister evil we sometimes imagine, but a man grossly astray, horribly misguided in his zeal. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed - very human while being divine. The final dialogue is thoughtful and is the kind of conversation that two powerful men could have when they come to commit an atrocity. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
