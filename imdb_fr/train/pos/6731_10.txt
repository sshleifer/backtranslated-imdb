I give 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * This gives a glimpse of something I hardly understand: surfers surf because they do not want to do; Nothing else seems to matter more to them than surfing; It's not a temporary thing either, it's a life for those guys. * Buried in the movie is a beautiful surfing story; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies and have seen a lot. None of them taught me what this movie did * The film was very well edited. It was flowing well. The interviews were remarkable * It's interesting from start to finish <br /> <br /> In summary, it's a documentary as good as the one I've seen, so I have to evaluate that according to that. So 10/10
