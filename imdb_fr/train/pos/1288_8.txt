Preston Waters is having a bad summer. Apart from the day of his birthday, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> He must first share his room with his brothers who will run a business. They can not do it in their room because they do not have enough space. At a birthday party, he only gets 6 tokens, while others receive 32, 35 and even 50 dollars. When one of his birthday cards arrives early, he receives only a check for $ 11. <br /> <br /> Going to the bank, he learns that he needs at least $ 200 to open an account. Leaving the bank, a tyrant steals the check. Continuing after the kid almost crushed him (his bike is ruined) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley also comes from the bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give this guy tomorrow. Quigley starts writing a check for damage, but only manages to write his name before a police car goes around the area. Frightened, he gives the check to Preston, informs him to give it to his father to finish. That night, Preston tells his father he does not want a new bike, he wants his. back from the room, better still his own house. His father locks him in his room for the rest of the evening. While sleeping in his room, Preston thinks that the situation can not be worse, he realizes he has forgotten the check because he is still in the pocket of his shirt. It's virgin. <br /> <br /> Using a computer and after much thought, he earns a million dollars. The next day, while he was trying to cash it in the bank, he entrusted it to the owner who thinks he is the person he is supposed to give and give. The person named Juice arrives a moment later. <br /> <br /> Now, the three must hunt down Preston. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston has fun buying all kinds of things. including her own house and even going to meetings with a disguised bank woman who is really and an FBI agent (who is trying to hunt down the 3 bad guys). He appoints this person, Mr. Macintosh, for whom he works and even organizes a party for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But finally, things are catching up (the money is exhausted, the bad guys get it back). <br /> <br /> All in all, a pretty funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you enjoyed it in Another Stakeout, you'll love it here. He's doing all kinds of crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (the stressed boss of Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful friendly driver in this movie.
