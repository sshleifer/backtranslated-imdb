I read so many comments that I, too, shared on the memory of this film and the fact that I wanted to see him so much, but I did not know the name of the film. Fortunately, after doing a search and finding the title on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie I remembered. I then did a search and found the movie. I was happy to be able to watch it again forty years later. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me and I want to thank you all. I want to share how I found this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy. It was on the VHS version of "Call it Courage" by Wonderful World of Disney which contained 2 films, the second being "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". It touched me as much as 40 years ago and now I have my own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on eBay and I saw several copies. Enjoy it, I know I did it! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about a boy's love and the eagle he's been dealing with. When the eagle was sacrificed, the boy released him because he could not allow him to be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe to be punished after releasing the eagle, he also saved his life and taught him more than how to survive. The proximity that the boy and the eagle shared in the desert was so moving and the filming was truly remarkable. What a wonderful time it was. I have never seen anything coming even close to this movie!
