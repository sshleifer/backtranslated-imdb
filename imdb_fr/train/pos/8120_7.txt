Things to Come is a first sci-fi movie that shows an imaginary world, or "Everytown" through 100 years. You can divide it into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film covers from 1940 to 2036 and mainly explains how this leader or the "Boss" wanted to be able to fly again in planes, after Everytown was bombed and the war broke out. <br /> <br /> This film only has about 3 flaws: its audio is muddy and the video has some oddities, the characters are not at all deep, and the plot in general is not quite solid . The plot is missing something that I can not put my finger on ... it just looks a little "mellow". But if you like science fiction and are interested in what H.G. Wells might be doing in the next hundred years, that's a must. It's worth a visit to find out what everyone was afraid of: a long and long war, because they were about to make war on Germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything else. <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a very good movie that most people need to see once.
