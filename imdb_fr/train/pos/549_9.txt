The year is 1896.Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. He has only one friend and his name is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), a compassionate old man. They drive a herd of cattle with them. It would be In Skagway, they face problems when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) grabs cattle. Now Jeff has to pick him up and drive him to Dawson by the Canada-US border. Now they have a group of people with like ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There, the two men enter the gold trade. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mann's and James Stewart, The Far Country (1954) is indeed a western. The acting work is superb.Walter Brennan makes a great sidekick to Stewart.Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet is lovely.Jay C. Flippen is very good in Dawson Marshal Rube Morris.The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles. It's fantastic to see how Jimmy Stewart overcame them. He just has the man and his rifle. But he is also vulnerable.
