I saw this film the first few seconds the voice of TR took me on the trip - well I did not like the big thumbs stuck at first, but the absurd humor and the gory looks of the two actors of siss√© - I do not know who played the young girl - but she was great and so it was uma !!! - <br /> <br /> the other two people who were out at the movies after about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's still a test to watch a movie I like good with one of my friends - and we both enjoyed the maximum - hilarious laughter - sadness about the "normal realistic policemen". Both of them, fans of T.Robbins' books ... I found it well done - I thought Robbins would also approve, although I do not know if he likes the movie or not ... <br /> <br /> I'd love to see the cut out movies - I heard that Gus v. Sand had to shoot a lot of scenes because of the viewers (or producers ???) for the first time. It's still an artistic film. way too short though ... this is one of my favorites of all time - and I'm aware that most people can not stand this kind of film and assume that people who love this movie are what they think ... what a shame. I hope the day comes when there will be a DVD with all the material - hoping to see more crispian, keanu - and see her baby and all the others <br /> <br /> if you have the chance to see it, think twice and enjoy it if you chose to watch ... m
