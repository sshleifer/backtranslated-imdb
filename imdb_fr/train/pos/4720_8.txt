A beautiful film, especially if you like horses, movies of the Second World War and the austere Hungarian Plateau. A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. The horse riding is spectacular as well as the horse of the main characters in his own training. <br /> <br /> I will buy this movie and see it again. It is a family film and I highly recommend it. A good movie '' Family Nite ''. Even though there were some scenes of violence, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The natives were very interesting in their way of resisting, even after the death of a Nazi officer who had his personal reasons for hounding Brady. A film of haunting beauty.
