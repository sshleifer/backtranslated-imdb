The film resists the tension of the tension that exists between a son and a father. <br /> <br /> The brilliant dialogue, the beautiful landscapes and the acting are a great way to present the onion that constantly peels. /> <br /> The fundamental issues of parenting, communication and virility are explored indirectly. <br /> <br /> In a funny way, the curtain is drawn, the masks come off a little and the truths are exposed. <br /> <br /> All this happens in a road trip format. The backdrop is the rural state of New York in early fall, just as the trees change color. WOW!
