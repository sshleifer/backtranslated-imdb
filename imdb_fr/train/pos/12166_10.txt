A very strange and convincing film. This is a very clumsy and very hurt man who is trying to find himself in his life as a fundraiser / salesman. The director was able to capture a very confusing tone that really served the story well. Original and disturbing, while finding a lot of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence in a test center that really stood out and made me laugh out loud, which I do not do as often as I should. One of the most memorable films I've seen in a long time. I have not left my mind and I look forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Fantastic performances all around. The simple line "I really appreciate it." is now iconic for me.
