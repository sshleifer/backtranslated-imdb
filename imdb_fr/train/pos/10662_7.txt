Leonard Maltin had to watch another movie. (Although I think his guide is a very valuable resource, please ignore his comments on this one.) He says "start well, then sparkle" when it's really the opposite - "start warm then catches fire". The plot is about as simple as possible. Happy mom, dad and happy son take a vacation on a secluded beach, dad became disabled by accident, mom went to get help and met a dangerous escaped convict. Mom tries to get the convict to help while his father waits and hang on for an expensive life. <br /> <br /> A good crazy punch gives Ralph Meeker an electric shock, suddenly appearing (the director, John Sturges, the astute film that will make you gasp) halfway as a sneaky and desperate criminal . Meeker is an unusually flippant and reckless actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly"). He happily grasps the keys to the story of the film and goes full circle. His character has a habit of smiling childishly and saying "pretty cool, huh?" when he is particularly happy about his misdeeds. There is a funny pause in action when they have a flat tire and he concisely orders his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not leave". She retorts, "Where shall I go?" (they are in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes that the sitcom is "Yeah, that's right". The friction between them is incredible. <br /> <br /> There are faults, faults a little ridiculous. There is a scene where the police, who have been pursuing Meeker for some time, are stopping Stanwyck's car and escaping detection. Meeker puts his head on his shoulder, as a loving husband would, and pretends to sleep during his interrogation. A. He looks remarkably non-masculine in this pose and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to be asleep at a meeting with law enforcement would certainly raise suspicion. <br /> <br /> Still solid thriller that leads to an exciting and uplifting conclusion. <br /> <br />
