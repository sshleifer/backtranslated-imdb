"Still Crazy" is without a doubt the biggest rock comedy of all time. He was wrongly compared to "This Is Spinal Tap", for which he has no connection. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and frankly not very good, despite its "release" of many rock clich√©s). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is populated by excellent actors, good songs and great human situations. You care about people in "Still Crazy". It's all that matters. Oh, yes, the music is very good too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American public already knew Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but only later would familiarize with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter films).
