Here is a rare gem for those of you who have not seen or probably not even heard of it. During the 1980s, Dennis Quaid was a rare commodity, but in the early '90s, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, all unfortunately bombed. Two of those movies that I liked a lot, and I would like to elaborate on one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a wacky movie about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), are ... fire starters: yes they have the power of pyro-kinetics . <br /> <br /> Wilder decided not to use his power (for anything useless anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, when he and his brother blew up a house abandoned who had killed a man who was inside to oppate him. for them. Nowadays, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to the crazy Vida (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest for, guess what, arson (see movie to better understand). Wilder has not spoken to Wallace for five years either, as Wallace set him on fire at his bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for fun. He also runs a carnival and is the chief clown. When the carnival arrives in the city of Wilder, Wallace decides to find his brother and see Vida, which he is in love! The house arrest of Vida is over, but Wilder is concerned. So, Wallace intervenes and the fun begins. Brother against brother ... fight fire by fire! <br /> <br /> Big balls of fire throw in this movie ... devour your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The film also contains some really strange but amusing elements, as Wilder's Fire Unit sings a capella songs during the fighting and after the fighting. Jim Varney (known worldwide as Ernest) appears as the friend of Wallace's Carnival. "Wilder Napalm" is brilliantly shot ... and cleverly staged ... very offbeat and avant-garde. <br /> <br /> Take a look at this one ...
