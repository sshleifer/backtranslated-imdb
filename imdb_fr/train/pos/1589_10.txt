I love this show. I watch all the reruns every day, even though I have seen them all about 6 times. <br /> <br /> These are two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly will live at Val's when their father is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment on the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems Vall and Holly are going through. The main problem concerns guys, but also responsibility and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 years old and is a totally free spirit, while Val is the opposite. She is organized and must have a plan to do any kind of person. <br /> <br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
