Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for the struggle for freedom in India, ignored his own family and son. This film talks about his son Hiralal who feels neglected because of Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The film begins in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights the cause of India's freedom from the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his lawyer father, since Gandhi was involved in the fight for freedom. He wanted his wife and children to join him in serving society. Therefore, Hirarlal does not have the opportunity to finish his studies and fails his exams, he marries his gulab of love (bhoomika Chawla) against the will of his father. Hiralal's ambition is to travel to England and become a lawyer just like his father, but his own father refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and gives it to another person, saying that should not be limited family and should be open to the most deserving students living in the colony. This hiralal anger and the fracture between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father to neglect and blame him for his lack of education and unemployment. Hiralal is struggling to make ends meet and falls into the street after failing in his business dealings and with huge debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna gave a stellar performance like Hiralal Gandhi .. all the bravo to him, the direction and the scenario are fantastic, the setting in image is excellent. Overall, an excellent film and must see. I give him a 10/10
