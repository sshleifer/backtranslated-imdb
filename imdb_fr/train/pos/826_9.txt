I'm fed up with people who complain about Ewoks! Admittedly, they are not the best thing that happened to Star Wars, but they happened, so fix yourself! Plus, they're cute, and I do not care if they're marketable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This film always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I am excited about The Phantom Threat, because it will suddenly take stock of Luke's entire story at Anakin. I like the way it is revealed in the end - it would be too irresolute in any other way. So, those of you who complain about removing Vader's helmet, take the time to think. It is very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a man who looks sick. He is not entirely a machine, he is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director chose such good actors in A New Hope. They are all doing so well. They are credible characters. Hamill does a great job with the dramatic development of his character. Fisher does a good job being a female model (I mean, come on, she killed Jabba even though so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - Should I say more? <br /> <br /> The music is brilliant again. It's so touching and meaningful to be able to choose character themes at different times in the movie. The best highlight is when Luke shouts "NOOO!" and jump to fight his father in the final battle. John Williams is nothing less than a genius! What an incredible man! <br /> <br /> Already, the movie has a lot more meaning for me because of episode I. I can not wait to finally see it in theaters (Can I wait ???) and then, look again the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
