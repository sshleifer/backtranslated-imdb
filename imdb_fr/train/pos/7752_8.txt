Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted it. As simple as that, and he succeeded. Not only in his goal, but also in making a wonderful movie, especially visually. He knows how to use saucepans, slow motion sequences, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. in an elegant and fluid way. This gives the film a very relaxing feeling. <br /> <br /> The story tells the life of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party they all attend, which turns it from this film. The beauty of this image does not lie in the question of how the characters act on each other (compared to a similar film, of course of better quality, like Magnolia). I just do not think it was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the different details of the experiences of the people who make or break their lives. Barman is very good at telling these little stories that describe small experiences. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, but it's not a surprise, because we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his group of US. The music is sometimes warm and at the same time relaxing, which contributes to the sensation of softness and softness of the film. Other times, we hear great pop / rock melodies that give certain scenes the strength they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one fault, namely the last half hour. Was it the runtime that separated me? Or were the last scenes not as fresh and precise as those until then? I can not understand ... <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a beautiful sunny film that raises Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> (It's the breeze that runs through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon that makes her even more beautiful, it's the cool breeze that relaxes you when she crosses you at a crowded party when someone opens the door, it's the breeze that carries the scent of this beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park you just met a week ago is the breeze. ....) <br /> <br />
