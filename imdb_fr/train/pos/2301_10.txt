Really ... and an incredible movie that is not very popular ... extremely moving and almost upsetting life ... at least for me. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Added to my favorite movie list .... it's now number one .... <br /> <br /> This is a very moving film that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon ..... we go it's just amazing. It's now my favorite movie and I only see it today and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 if you are a little mature ... If you do not really try to feel the emotions of the characters So you'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie .... But it's really amazing .... just look at it because it will change the way some people see life. ... it's worth the trip 5/5
