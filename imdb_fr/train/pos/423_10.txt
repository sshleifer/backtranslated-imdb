I just read the summary of the plot and this is the worst I have ever read. It does not do justice to this incredible movie. For an example of a good summary, read the list on "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, it was one of my favorite movies as a young kid. My sister and I were looking forward to seeing T.V. every April. It's one of the best equestrian movies of its time. This is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The romance is clean and endearing. The scenario is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make movies like that anymore. Good game and not too much. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other great players.
