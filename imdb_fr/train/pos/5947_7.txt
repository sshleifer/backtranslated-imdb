At 50, this fantastic musical might look like her age, but she wears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This film is always so much fun. Crosby has never been a truly romantic raw material, but it delivers the material with the slightly humorous side it needs. Bendix plays wide and is very entertaining in a game that uses his strengths. Hardwicke - what joy for a knight of the realm - a real one - to embark on such careers with such abandonment. And Rhonda Fleming has fun in the least obvious of the main roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappoints as an unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a musical, the songs are very good and the "dance" routine that accompanies Busy Doing Nothing is perfect - funny, appropriate, deft and without challenge, and pulling a virtue from Crosby's musical movement that, let's be fair, was fundamentally amusing, as it was never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is beautiful, the sound is a little muddy in places. And the story - well, it takes some liberties with the original, but I suspect that Mr. Clemens could very well have been satisfied with the result.
