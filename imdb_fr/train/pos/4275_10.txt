In fact, I'm surprised there have been so many comments on this film. I saw him as part of a Slavic film festival at a major American university. But no one in the United States has heard about it, which is a shame! The dynamic between people is what makes it both funny and sad. They are stuck together in a long bus trip - a place where most of us have been !! But I never had one like that !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where they stop for funerals. Then the man and woman slip away to make love in the forest, but everyone follows them to watch them without their knowledge! Just when she lifts her skirt and it penetrates completely - the consumer begins to hack and they realize that everyone is watching us !! Talk about surprise! But ... you really have to be sensitive to them even if it's funny! When you see the end, it's ironic that they had fun during this time! Serbian humor at its best!
