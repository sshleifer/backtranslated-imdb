MGM did not know how to market Garbo when he arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of confidence in her and her appearance in "Torrent" justified it. She did not speak a word of English and therefore had trouble working. Ricardo Cortez did not make it very easy. <br /> <br /> The torrent of the title is the river Juscar which winds a small sleepy village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes one day that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her parents in difficulty. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love but he is under the thumb of his mother and can not make her consent for her marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) expelled Leonora's parents from their home and sent Leonora to Paris in hopes of giving her a chance to continue her singing career. Leonora sends a note to Rafael, inviting him to remember his promise and follow it. His mother is angry and forbids him to go. So, of course, he gives in to his request. <br /> <br /> The years go by. Leonora has a new identity: it has become La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael was just as his mother wanted him to be - he is running for office and is courting a "safe" girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), who is a "pig's heiress". Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old house, and I agree - why did not she help her mother. His mother still lives at the family home, works as a skivvy and does the laundry. Leonora and Rafael meet but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so beautiful to beauty that it's hard to believe he could be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam is breaking and the torrent floods the city. Leonora's house is on the way to the raging river but when Rafael tries to rescue her, he is very safe. They then rekindle their romance. There is a "horizontal" love scene in this film, very similar to "The flesh and the devil". <br /> <br /> Dona Brull tells stories about how Leonora really got rich and her mother believes. and told Leonora to go there. Rafael meets Leonora just before going on tour in America. Once again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down. He spends so much time listening to others destroy his reputation - "What will she do for you but will not lower you". The irony is that she has just found him a job in the government, if he accompanies him. They find themselves years later - she's still fresh and dynamic - he looks older than his age, bent on mediocrity. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a good movie with a positive message to follow your heart. . <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupido, the barber and former and loyal friend of Leonora. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
