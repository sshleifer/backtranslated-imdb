- Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions in New York, finds a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find simple life. But building a house is anything but simple. As headaches and bills start to accumulate, laughter too. Will Mr. Blanding ever have the house of his dreams? <br /> <br /> - What makes this film so special are the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. All three are able to make a film alone. So when you combine their talents, almost all scenes are special. Grant has always been one of my favorites in this type of role. He is so good at playing the put husband. Loy is always a joy to watch. Thin Man's films she made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become one of my favorites over the past two or three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> - The film is definitely a product of its time. I'm crazy to imagine a time when you could build a two-story, three-bedroom, four-bathroom home with an income of $ 15,000 a year. Add to that that your two children go to private school and that you have a maid who becomes almost fanciful. <br /> <br /> - However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many situations and difficult situations in which the Blanding are found are easy to understand today. And this is where the comedy comes in. How many people have done some of the nonsense of the couple in this film to eventually cost more than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the entire subplot "wife in love with his best friend". This is really not necessary for the plot and feels out of place and very uncomfortable as presented.
