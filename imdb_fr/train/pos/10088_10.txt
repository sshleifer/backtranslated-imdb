Elephant Walk (1954) With Peter Finch at the beginning of his career as lord of the manor in an abandoned plantation of God where the danger is always that of elephants or crazy Englishmen, staying outside under the midday sun and becoming crazy. Finally, they do, of course, after the epidemic of typhoid or cholera, and a lot of chaos ensues. Taylor has replaced Vivien Leigh in trouble in this adventure / boiler movie. When the elephants storm the house and trap Liz on the big stairs, I still get goose bumps. Thank God, Dana Andrews is here to save the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. In color too!
