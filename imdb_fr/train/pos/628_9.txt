This movie is very funny. The actors really make the film go off. Without revealing the plot, I would describe her as a new favorite of Princess Bride's cult, which should stand the test of time. You get to see a completely different side of Robert DeNiro in this movie! (That's worth the admission price just for that!) All the elements are present, from adventure to novel, and a well-placed comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will benefit. (My parents even did it!) Good special effects can scare the little ones. Good date movie. Ideal for a getaway. <br /> <br /> Deserve an A. (hopefully it will be well at the box office)
