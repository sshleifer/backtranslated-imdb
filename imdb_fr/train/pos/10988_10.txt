Do not read anything about this movie (especially nothing that can contain spoilers). Just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience. If you like to see a clever and twisted story, get the DVD and you will not be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a sci-fi movie, but a psychological thriller set in the globalized business environment. It's about business secrets, how big companies are spying between their research departments and their methods. The actors make a good performance and the general visual style of the film offers a perfect cold mode. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - which belongs to the story and the end - also more satisfying than the other films of "Cube" and "Nothing" by Vincenzo Natali. In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and it's something I really do not say about every fifth movie done well). Sorry, I can not tell you more about this movie without risking your experience. Just give it a chance. ;-)
