I liked the film, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story told in the film felt condensed from a much longer story. As the book is over 400 pages long, it makes sense. It spans a period from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictitious country of South America, also much to integrate in the available time. I think it would have been much better as a six-hour mini-series than a 140-minute film. <br /> <br /> Even if it is rushed, the story does not jump so much that it becomes confusing. What is said is said well enough. One fault is that Clara's supernatural powers appear incoherently; either they should have appeared more evenly during the film, or they should have been left out. Two other faults (which could be harmful): Esteban's eventual return to goodness happens a little too suddenly, and Ferula's spell seems to fade, even if the tone of the story suggests that it should last eternally. <br /> <br /> The acting game is excellent. Glenn Close, in the role of the tormented girl Ferula, is remarkable. Jeremy Irons, as a brutal and self-taught rich man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, as lead character Clara, is great, although she's often better than she was in this movie. There were also many small roles well executed. The biggest fault is that the film seemed to lack a coach in dialect; each actor seemed to speak with a different accent.
