It takes courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, in which he is not shown as a man who could do nothing wrong. This film shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances are fantastic, the cinematography fantastic, the direction fabulous, but the film drags. If the intention was to make this film without any wait at the box office, which, I suppose, is the case here, then it's a brilliant attempt, but if the filmmakers expected it to be a success commercial, the fate of the film was doomed to the place the day they chose this topic. <br /> <br /> In 20 years, we will remember this film for the brilliant performance of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna.It deserves an Oscar nomination for this one..And honestly, it's not the only one performance that deserves to be applauded, Shefali Chhaya is great too. <br /> <br /> See the scene where Harilal learns the death of his father.No dialogues, No shouting, but a silent shot of Khanna.This is one of the most beautiful scenes of the film history <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes, its excellent cinema and a watch to watch absolutely. Bright attempt ..
