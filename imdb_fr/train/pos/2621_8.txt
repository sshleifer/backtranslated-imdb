Disney did it again. Brilliant the way Timone and Pumbaa are brought back to life to tell us how they came to meet Simba when he needed it. I love this movie and watch it again and again. This shows how Timone lived with his family and his meek colleagues before leaving in search of his dream home and his adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and things change. Together, they search for the house that Timon wants and fail repeatedly, which is fun as Timone gets more and more crazy. Then Simba arrives and we see more of his childhood than in the 2 previous films. The rest, you already know.
