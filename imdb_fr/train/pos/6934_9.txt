Winchester '73 is a beautiful story and that's what I like. This is not your usual western - it uses a rifle, which passes the hand of different characters - as a mechanism to tell the story of these people. Rock Hudson embodies an Indian chef, Jimmy Stewart, a leading man with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters, a gal who has to deal with the realities of her husband and the Wild West. It is important to note that the politically correct types kill many Indians in this film without remorse. According to current standards, it's still pretty violent. But it's a beautiful story to watch. Enjoy!
