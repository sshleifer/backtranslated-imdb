There is certainly an emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship - one based primarily on a physical attraction from the start. And there is also emotion in the inner workings of Mathieu's family dealing with his mother's problems - and how that affects their relationship. But the problem is that many things remain unanswered (unless I am too stupid to understand them). Why is Mathieu in a psychiatric hospital? What led to the breakup of boys? And going back and forth between the present and the past is a bit difficult to follow at the beginning. It seems that the main reason for renting this movie is to enjoy homoerotic sensations or male nudity. But as a history of love or study of character, it is lacking and unsatisfactory.
