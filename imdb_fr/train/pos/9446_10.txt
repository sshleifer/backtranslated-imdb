James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When we read "Deliverance", we are instantly transported to the lush forests of the Great South. When we look at the film version of John Boorman's book, we realize how much he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. The characters are fully realized and the performances are fantastic. I first saw this film in 1992, after my first year of university. I was in a phase where I watched films that were all broadcast a few years after I was born in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Butterfly" and "All the men of the president"; beautiful movies, all. This one was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.
