I do not know at all how IMDb sorts the reviews, but I know that, as often happens on Amazon.com, there is an awful lot of very negative reviews for this movie that repeat the same rather obscure talking points, almost in extenso. A campaign? Only IMDb knows it. <br /> <br /> For this film, it's good. It's a funny, cute and very simple movie. <br /> <br /> I've been working in Brooklyn for over 10 years, living in Queens and visiting relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing unauthentic or exploitative about these children. Is the grandmother a weird character? Yep. Does dialogue and intrigue recognize this? Yes, thankfully, they do it. Are other films shot in the LES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican children? You betcha. Does this make this movie a crime? as some of the comments (in my eyes, astroturf) suggest? Barely. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> It's better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Scoff in comparison but _n've ever had_ and I am deeply touched by the humility of the purpose of this film and its tender spirit. <br /> <br /> That said, I would like to know the background behind all this gossip! :-RE
