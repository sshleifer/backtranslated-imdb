With his horns, his bells, his phone and his trombones darkening Oliver Hardy, his doctor, Finlayson, recommends calm and tranquility and a diet with goat's milk. Stan Laurel, partner, offers an excellent solution: live on a boat dock so that the sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. This is a good base for all the hijinks of the cap's madness, as the boat is drifting by the hungry goat and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) settles for the ride. <br /> <br /> I had a kick on all the gags in the movie, starting with this sign in the Horn Test Factory - "Silence while men work". The first story of the boys' apartment features a number of plumbing and appliance issues, with Stan preparing a banana in a piece of banana. Laurel has a few broad lines in the picture, like "We had to be disconnected", but the one that made me roll was her criminal response aboard the ship - "Self-preservation is the last law of averages" - precisely ! <br /> <br /> I'm not as good a student of Laurel and Hardy movies as many others on this forum. All I know is that I loved them as a kid and that I find them as entertaining as today. when I was young. On this point, "Saps At Sea" provides a decent hour of hornophobic pleasure, well on the way to the hornomania.
