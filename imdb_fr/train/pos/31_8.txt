Once upon a time in a castle ...... Two little girls play in the garden castle. They are sisters. A blonde girl (Kitty) and a brunette (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty continues Evelyn. Crossing long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting on a chair, reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn as she watches with interest a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly: "I am the red woman and Kitty is the black woman". Suddenly, Evelyn catches a dagger nearby and stabs Kitty's doll, then cuts off her head (the doll). A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided. <br /> <br /> Then, their grandfather tells them the legend relating to the photo hanging on the wall in front of which a lady dressed in black stabs a lady. Dressed in red: <br /> <br /> "A long time ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle, they were sisters and hated one night, for reasons of jealousy, the black lady came one year later, the red lady left her grave, she killed six innocent people and her seventh victim was the black lady.All hundred years, the events are repeated in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself. "<br /> <br /> The grandfather ends his story by claiming that, according to legend, in sixteen years, the red queen should return to kill seven times. But he assures them that this is only an old legend. <br /> <br /> Sixteen years have passed ..... <br /> <br /> This is the very beginning of the film. There are a lot of twists and surprises in the film. It's best if you forget the logic (if you really analyze the story, it does not make sense) and follow the film with its gorgeous colors, gorgeous women, clothes, neat decor, light effects and the beautiful soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro, among other goddesses. Sybil Danning is a naked woman lying on a couch and dreaming. And do not forget: the lady in red kills seven times! <br /> <br /> If you liked "La Dama Rossa ...", take a look at "La Notte che Evelyn usc√¨ dalla Tomba".
