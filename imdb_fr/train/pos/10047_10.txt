To all the miserable people who have done everything since the debate, the budget, the present and the ... who wants to hear it? If you missed the goal of this film beyond beauty, it's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirty-something guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in his own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night. This is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know it's the cynical 90s and the millennium has everyone on fire, but go for it. Someone on this comment board complained about making too much money! How is it lame? He has generated wads of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the most profitable film on the planet. I will gladly agree with the majority this time. Ok, cynical, it's time to come back under your rock, I'm done.
