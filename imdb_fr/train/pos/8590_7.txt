Since Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of television, it was acquired, I had to go to the movies and spend $ 15. I also think this applies to fans of Eva Longoria. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president. As the investigations progress, it seems that the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Invoking innocence, Pete continues in a fugitive style in search of the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling empty, but you could certainly do worse.
