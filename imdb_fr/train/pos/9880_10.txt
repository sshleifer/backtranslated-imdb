This movie was shot in 1943 when I think Judy was at its peak (looks wise). In her previous film, For Me and My Gal, people often say that she looks emaciated. Well, in this movie, she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has the flair for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this film is hilarious, especially at first, when it tries to organize an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes in my opinion is Judy's interpretation of Lady Macbeth and when John searches her at the party to spank her (Lol). <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, one minute, he despises her and the next, they go out to an appointment, and then the next time they meet after that date, they are in love. <br /> <br /> Another point I did not like was the opening night. If I were Lily, I'd be mad at John but she's not ... it does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> But all in all, I should give this movie a 10 because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
