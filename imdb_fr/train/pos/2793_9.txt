It's so bad that because of its title, this film will be avoided by those who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a sports film. The story is touching and clever without being soppy, the jokes were funny, funny, and the characters are well played. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, performing excellently on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as a worried father of Jess, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so incredibly naughty in "Ride with the Devil", seems so good for the good guy, fully exploiting his superb Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, check out this movie. If anything will make you smile.
