_Waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of spinal wounded cleverly. From lean torments of defective fluorescent lamps blinking overhead to sexuality, masculinity and depression, the experience of disability is unveiled. <br /> <br /> The diversity of central characters underscores the complexity of the material examined - Joel, the writer, Raymond, the black man with a troubled past, and Bloss, the racist biker. At first, these men are united only by the nature of their wounds, but retain their competitive spirit. Over time, shared experiences, good and bad, bring them together as friends to support each other. <br /> <br /> The most obvious transformation is that experienced by Joel, who initially moves away from his fellow patients with sunglasses. headphones and curtains. As he comes to accept the changes that disability has brought to his life, Joel gets rid of these props and begins to get involved in the struggles of the men with whom he shares custody. <br /> <br /> The dance to which the title refers refers to this daily struggle to keep one's head out of the water; to give up dance is to reject life. Waterdance is a powerful and moving film on many levels, and I do not hesitate to recommend it.
