After being forced to miss out on real little travelers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl), I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". For once, I did not guess the end! It was funny and entertaining and did not resort to a ton of rude humor, despite the title. My boys (ages 6 and 10) loved that too - oh and my 45 year old boy had a smile on his face all the time. It's a family film that is not only tolerable for parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "He does not stop singing just to annoy me !!" In addition, the way the newborn tries to make friends and how these friendships are formed is in tune with the behavior of the children. Of course, parents have to be a bit clumsy - but in my favorite scenes, the father gets used to his new job. Enjoy!
