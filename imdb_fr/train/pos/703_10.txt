I rated this as a grade of ten just because I find it really impressive what only one eighteen year old can do with a video camera. It's not an epic but it's very engaging and I never got bored. If tens of millions of dollars can be invested in the countless bad movies that are poured in mass, give this director the same amount and see what happens. I know I'll be queuing at the local cinema for his first major release. Good job, and well worth the money. What a script! It may be a small budget, but that's half of the big pictures I've seen recently. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on screen. Congratulations to her, I can not wait to see more.
