As for the B movies, they were way above the average (I warn the reader now that I can reveal some key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, although I try to minimize a such trend). As was often the case with the suites, it was absolutely fantastic (despite a "cookie cutter" approach) to copy some elements of the original text of the movie. Despite this sometimes tedious trend, it seemed to work in this particular movie, as long as the viewer could. divides his attention from comparisons with the original "scanners"). <br /> <br /> The film was very similar to the "Superman" series, with regard to the main character's description of his early childhood and his relationship with his parents (who appeared to be modeled on the same model as the Kent in the stories of "Superman") and the theme of a morally pure hero, endowed with extraordinary powers from an early age, etc. The representation of profound feelings of alienation from prodigious or otherwise no The compliance with children, adolescents and / or adults was a theme that reminded me of films such as "Real Genius" and (to a more superficial degree) "Doctor Mordrid" and struck a particularly strong agreement. <br /> <br /> The film had a positive message, and was fun to watch. I found some of the ideas and precision (in terms of describing some aspects of the paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even deeply touching at times. These moments have sometimes appeared among all the big schlocks free character and generic formula (here, the sexual elements have been worked with taste) and the violence that makes B movies (or Shakespearean plays, by the way!) Fun to watch! <br /> <br /> This is a must watch for all fans of comics, science fiction, "viewer" and horror fanatic! With the right exposure in the appropriate circles, the film could develop a real cult, with the original "Scanners".
