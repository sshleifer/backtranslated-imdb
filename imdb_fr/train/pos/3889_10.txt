Eddie Izzard is nothing less than a comedy genius, and it's Eddie at his best. His material is extremely witty and hilarious, and his performance is among the best ever seen on stage. Instead of insulting the public's intelligence, he relies on humor for his wardrobe, Hitler, lunar, and British preferences. With so many memorable laughs, we can not help but repeat some of his lines. Still more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a stand-up routine. All high-quality stand-up comedy fans should see "Dress to Kill". Eddie Izzard is by far the best British humorist I have ever attended, but he has had a hard time winning on stage. However, his lack of commercial success in the film should not be indicative of his extreme talent. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure that, fortunately, has found its way to personal video, and can and should be enjoyed again and again.
