That's My Bush is a live action project directed by the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, not because of bad reviews (it actually got good reviews) but because it was very expensive. It's also a political satire. Now it's not nearly as good as South Park, but it's a very funny parody of a sitcom and also a very good political satire. The guy playing in my bush looks a lot like him! If you can find the show, take a look at it. There is a lot of laughs to do! <br /> <br /> 9/10
