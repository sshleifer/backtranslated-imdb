At the time of writing, John Carpenter's "Halloween" is approaching its 30th anniversary. It has since spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a bunch of imitations and every year around Halloween, when they make the list of these "Top 10 scariest movies", it's still there. This is quite amazing for a film made with a budget of about $ 300,000 and featuring a distribution then totally unknown promising young talents. I could go on and on, but the big question is: how does the film fit today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Highlights: A simple but spooky opening credit sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and catchy score by director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography. Carpenter's stellar director who keeps the suspense high, gets great shots and makes sure not to show his villain too much. Good performance of the distribution then almost unknown. A good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary and mean guy. Many strange moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow but steady and never hangs. Unlike most other slasher movies, this one is more focused on suspense and terror than on the blood and a lot of people. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: It's probably not as scary as it is today. Many gaffes really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I would like to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's really what I feel. Despite this, it's really an important film that continues to reach new generations of moviegoers. And it is not because it has been redone for a new generation that we will forget it. No way, no way. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
