I went to see Ashura at the kickoff of the 2005 Fantasia Festival. Dude, it was a cool kickoff. The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons, he's still in Japan ... oh my God, I hope he's better and that he's doing a lot of other movies. <br /> <br /> The plot It's pretty simple, but a little original ... the demons roam at Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called "Demon Guards" massacre them and fear the rebirth of Ashura, the demon goddess who sleeps and is supposedly very crazy. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Izumo ... a kind of elite swordsman called "Slayer Demon" and his friend Jaku who is the typical asshole and violent jealous ... <br /> That seems boring? Well now, it's getting thicker .... <br /> <br /> Izumo has retired after killing a demon because he "felt" that he was the devil, he never knew but he had killed her. Thus, Izumo continued his life and recycled himself in the Kabuki theater. In a boat ride on a beautiful night, Izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge. It changes his life and starts again to kill demons ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and damn ... the guy knows. how to manipulate a sword and commit an entertaining slaughter. <br /> <br /> Izumo wears the film as far as playing ... he's the complete package ... he knows how to fight (hell yeah he knows), he's witty, he's smart and he's this courage. You must never shout: "NO IZUMO, It's a trap" The guy already knows, he has that sense. He is really the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As far as cinematography is concerned, aesthetics is very interesting. This is by far the most manga-like movie. It's full of special effects and nothing, at any price, will prevent this film to look realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Many colors, an "unreal" photograph, other than that ... it's quite simple ... but as I said, the main character wears the film A must-see, a tale led by masterful hands
