Rumor has it that ABBA ?? The Swedish star of the Swedish disco, several times awarded, had reached its zenith. The group was disappointed to sing in English and aspired to perform in their native language. Shortly after, problems began to appear in the marriage partnership at one point and recordings became less and less common. The band dissolved, even unofficially, in 1982 and pop lost one of its most famous artists. Although they never admitted that these rumors were true, the fact remains that ABBA would never have been so successful if they only recorded in their mother tongue. If you want to use the world's largest money-making media market, you need to speak to an English-speaking audience. <br /> <br /> It's amazing for me to see how small a small island is at a stone's throw away. The remoteness of the European continent might have created perhaps the most recognized language, although not the most widely spoken, of the world. Everyone speaks a little English. whether it's just "hello" or a dirty word, you'll find an anglophone almost everywhere. Pedro Galindo obviously did not agree because Trampa Infernal has never been subtitled for world consumption until its recent release on DVD. It's a real shame, because it's actually a good slasher movie that's way better than many of its English-speaking compatriots. <br /> <br /> The film launches into the rather unknown territory of the duel of the pistols. We see two unidentified characters sneaking around a dilapidated complex looking for each other for the inevitable final confrontation. After some suspense and some failures, one of the pistolers emerges victoriously. Then we learn that it was only paintball guns and that the two competitors are actually young people from the city. Nacho and Mauricio are the fiercest rivals and Mauricio is still trying to prove he is better than his soft-spoken opponent, but for the moment he has not been successful. <br /> <br /> Later in the night, as the victorious shooter celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend Alejandra and his boyfriend Charly, Mauricio enters the bar and says he has a final challenge for his glorious nemesis. He says it will be the competition that will prove once and for all the city that deserves the greatest respect. Nacho is initially reluctant because Alejandra warns him against the dangers of permanent competitiveness, but ends up yielding to the weight of pressure exerted by his peers and accepts; to the great disgust of his morally superior partner. <br /> <br /> They plan to visit the remote area of ​​Filo de Caballo, because the press reported that many people had been massacred by what the locals think they are. a vicious bear. Mauricio proposes that anyone who kills the animal be considered as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle he will fight against his opponent. <br /> <br /> After visiting the armory to stock weapons and ignore After the warnings of the old storekeeper, the group began to move away from the isolated forest. Hunters are hunted when they learn that "the bear" is in fact a veteran homicide of Vietnam, who still does not know that the war is over and considers all humans as his enemy. What began as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are hunted down and murdered by the evil killer. <br /> <br /> I took Trampa while I was studying in Madrid with a Mexican student who lived in the dormitory. -port for me. I remember that the copy I watched was flawed and that the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits, which meant I could never see the final scenes. Fortunately, I came across the budget DVD recently on Amazon and immediately added it to my collection. <br /> <br /> The Gallindo Slasher is a surprisingly good effort, one that excels with its skilful direction and enthusiastic plot, which attempts to cover areas that are not usually tackled by slasher movies. It's so good that it reminded me many times of Arnold Schwarzenegger's classic Predator. This is especially evident in scenes where the assassin, masked by goosebumps, jogging in the forest and hunt down the frantic troop as he struggles to escape the maniac's playground. <br /> <br /> Despite Gallindo's obvious awareness of genre platitudes (the scarecrow even uses a Freddy Kruegar-style glove); Trampa is also trying to add something different to the standard model. While the majority of the execution time respects the concrete rules of the category, the last third announces a big step forward as an individual: the maniac is armed with a machine gun and leads the hero in his lair for the final confrontation. From there, the film quickly exchanges genres and becomes almost an action movie that, according to your tastes, will enthrall you or disappoint you. The last slasher that tried to cross the two styles was "The Majorettes", a bad entry of the 80s, which is not necessarily a good thing. <br /> <br /> As is the case with many Latin films (including Spanish films by Almodovar and Amenabar), Trampa has a subtle moral connotation to its story, which is transmitted successfully without being pressed into the the spectator's throat. Surrender to the temptations of competitive masculinity and you can not always be the winner. It's a sugar-coated dot, but it's treated with enough delicacy to not detract from the fun of the feature. <br /> <br /> Trampa can be nerdy, but he deserves to be seen and recognized as one of the best late-night slashers. . The killer looks great in a very scary military outfit with a white Valentine style mask and in attempts to manufacture for the originality of his work. He may lack the composure that most sincere horror fans appreciate, but he has enough suspense and creativity to justify at least one visualization.
