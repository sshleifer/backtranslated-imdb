I was reviewing my old VHS tapes and came across the John Denver TV series and The Muppets A Christmas Together. This prompted me to go to my computer and search for it to see if I could find a DVD version of this series to buy. I was disappointed that I could not find it on DVD yet. The show aired in 1979 and was a delicious show. I have the record and the CD but I would like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the picture quality is good but fades, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also some other songs that have not been inserted on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and the Muppets, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you do not have the CD, this is a wonderful collection of songs from this Chritmas show. The album is also good if you can find it and you still have a disc player to play it.
