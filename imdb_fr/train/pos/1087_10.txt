There is so much to love in this little darling comedy. Anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just ran out of space, will find that there is more than one grain of truth in Mr. Blanding's tragic situation. The young woman Douglas, with great comic energy, tells and acts as a lawyer and voice of reason Blanding. Similarly, Myrna Loy is at her best as a sparse wife, but extremely patient. But the best performance is Grant's. He is the American man, particularly important at the time of the release of this film, while the country was facing a shortage of housing after the end of the war. The themes are universal, lack of money, hard work, fear of infidelity. happy ending. It's still relevant today, and I have to point out the bad reviews I see about a current preference for silly and disgusting comedies. The film has a smooth look, and there are good moments of comedy, especially at the beginning. Although the film has lost its social relevance, almost sixty years after its release, it is still a jewel.
