It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their delirious children. I felt that instead of a movie ticket, I should have become a member of NAMBLA. <br /> <br /> According to Thomas Rockwell's respected book How To Eat Fried Worms begins like any other children's story: moving to a new city. Grade Five student Billy Forrester was very popular, but must start from scratch. Making friends is never easy, especially when Poindexter Adam is the only way. Or Erica, who at 4 1/2 feet, is a giant. <br /> <br /> Joe is still plotting. Her freckled face and sleeveless shirts are discouraging. He challenges children with the Ring of Death: a Crackerjack ring that, according to rumor, could kill you if you are hit. But not right now. No, the ring of death releases a poison that kills the eighth grade students. <br /> <br /> Joe and his axis of evil greet Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays cool, swearing that he's eating worms all the time. Then he throws them in Joe's face. Ewww! To convince them, Billy reluctantly bets he can eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in a spicy sauce, crushed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is dubbed an exotic name, such as "Radioactive Slime Delight", in which children finally realize their dream of microwaving a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you've already met me, you'll know that I have a hearty uncontrollable laugh. I felt like a creep rising in front of a toddler who lamented that his "dilly dick" hurt him. But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting. Like a film of the Farrelly brothers, ranked G, it is both vomiting and delightful. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also an informed storyteller. To increase the stakes, the worms must be consumed before 19 hours. In addition, Billy has an obscure secret: he has an extremely sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. With such precision, he is inspired by the insecurities of children and their tendency to exaggerate commonplace dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you had to hyperbolise this film in the manner of children, you will see that it is essentially war. Proxy warriors use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars to learn a valuable lesson on unity. International leaders can learn more about peacekeeping around the world from Fried Worms. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was comforted by the fact that two chaperone mothers behind me looked at each other with a confused look and agreed, "It was a good movie." Great, I will not need to register in any legal database.
