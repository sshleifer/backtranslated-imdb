This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this, the dead (called zombies) got up to eat the living. However, a company has developed a collar that, when placed around the neck of zombies, makes them docile and perfect servants. Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), Robinson's mom, her dad, Bill (Dylan Baker), and her son, Timmy (K'Sun Ray), engage a zombie, because all the members of their block already have one. Tim calls the Fido zombie (Billy Connolly) and befriends him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is - among other things - a flight of the series "Lassie", Fido being a replacement Lassie. Timmy was named like that for a reason! All famous episodes of Lassie are spun here. My favorite is that Timmy sends Fido for help before the zombies eat him! It's also a satire of those 1950s Douglas Sirk movies where everything is bright and colorful - but dark secrets tear people apart. The characters wear VERY vivid clothes from the 1950s (Moss is still in a dress) - the furniture, sets and cars are all 1950's in super bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive, there is always something to watch. The script is good - but you can only make many jokes about Lassie. The melodramatics are a little ridiculous but the distribution tears it off. Everyone here is excellent and straight to the point. Even Connolly, as an emotionless zombie, does a good job. Moss is the best - play every line at its true value, but never go to the sea. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost for most people and gore is pretty docile. The gore is so casual and with joyful music, it's hard to take it seriously. So for some people, it will really work. I give him an 8.
