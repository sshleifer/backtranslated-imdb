Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie itself seemed pretty interesting, the real thing that drew me into this one is Matt Lillard, all right. Most people probably think that he is too happy with caffeine or that it is really bad, but we are both of the same age and generation. I have watched this guy so often that he is one of my favorites now. This is one of the few movies where he stars and stars, as in SLC Punk, another great Lillard movie. <br /> <br /> Baiscally is the story of your usual movies, but with more twists than anything. who are starting to go crazy. Another great actor by the name of Vincent D'onofrio, a person very little appreciated in the film industry, is also remarkable. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she is not that bad, although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =) <br /> <br /> C is a game of Jack vs Jill vs Bob as everyone wants to reap the fruits but share with nobody. They are all trying to kill each other and it's a time bomb ready to explode. Matt shows his true feats as a JAck planner who started the project as a whole. Vincent and a woman play a couple of art thieves who need money for lack of business. The character of Vince is a little disturbed and skitz throughout the film but it only adds to the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> The surprises left and right are well received and the end is very clich√© and makes you happy. Well, maybe it depends on the type of endings you like. This film has always interested me, apart from the fact that Matt was there, it's an excellent film and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Critics will probably not like this movie, but they do not watch movies because they like movies anyway.
