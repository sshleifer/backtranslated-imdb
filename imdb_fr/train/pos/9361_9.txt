Reign Over Me (named after the song of Who) is a film that will please almost everyone. It was a moving story about a guy (sandler) who lost his family during the 9-11 World Trade Center attacks. Years later, he meets an old college mate (cheadle) whom he does not even recognize because of the post-dramatic stress of losing his family. The two find their former friendship and Johnson, the character of Cheadle, realizes that he must get the character of Sandler, Fineman, help before it is too late. <br /> <br /> This was the first film that made me cry for a long time. time. It is worth watching and after seeing it, I am convinced that the viewer will enjoy his family much more.
