It's a very good film. If so, Hong Sang-Soo is really "the best kept secret of Asian cinema". His style is very similar to that of Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien and covers much of the same topic thematically, but I think I appreciate it more as a whole than in any of their films. The declared minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work, although it perfectly corresponds to this style (the camera never moves once) and, in one way or another, I found the film less "consciously" as Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao. -hsien, which, I think, is part of the reason why I enjoyed it more. Moreover, he does not keep his subjects as detached as Hou. I had the impression that the film was also somehow more "complete" and less open (barely) than some of their work, even if it does not mean that it looked a lot like a pre-game plot. keep. It would be hard for me to believe that Sophia Coppola is not directly influenced by this film of "Lost in Translation" (scenes of a young woman wandering alone and languid in her hotel room wearing a punk panties that can not to avoid appearing familiar).
