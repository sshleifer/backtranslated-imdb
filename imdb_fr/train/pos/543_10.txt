This film is the best horror film, without exception. I like how Stanley just threw women into the lake. I have been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years and he has blown me away. It's a mix of horror, drama and romance, not so much comedy. His diabolical but charming look captured me on the spot. This look in his eyes, I will never forget. I can not describe anything about it.
