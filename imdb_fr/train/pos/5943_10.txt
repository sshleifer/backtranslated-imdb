This movie is really cool. it looks like everything came out of the comic. the sets, the costumes and the plot are great. Clark Bartram is still our favorite batman. he looked a little better in a dead end, but he did it anyway. Superman is great too. the flight effects are OK. but it's a fan-film, so we can not expect them to be the best. the shot with superman catching the car was VERY believable. It was cool. It's a movie that I would see if it were real. its all you want in a batman / superman movie. One exception though, I would throw the joker instead of 2 faces ..... overall, I give this movie a 10 because it's a great movie.
