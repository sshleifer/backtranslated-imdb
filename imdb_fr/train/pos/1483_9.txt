A sophisticated contemporary fable about the tensions that help to relax and finally untie the wedding vows. The narration stems from a "homily" pronounced by a country priest after the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. The future course of marriage is described, which gradually erases the stress of modern life. The "moral" of this story in a story is that for a marriage to succeed, both now and in the past, it was necessary that this relationship be stifled by family and friends. This film was a relative blockbuster compared to the national Italian standards. It's a shame that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
