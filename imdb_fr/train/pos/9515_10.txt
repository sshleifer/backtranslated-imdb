One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic end. The film is about the Sullivan family, of course, Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the murderer who says so and an expert. One of the kids wants to know about his father's work (a terrible mistake), so he's hiding in his father's car and he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it that way. <br /> <br /> Mafia didn In the mafia, no one wins, when they want to see you out, they take you out. Of course, you can see all those who work at the mafia with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but do a wrong job or do something that your "boss" does not want, and you are fired, and killed. <br /> <br /> You see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he should not have seen and, finally, almost his entire family is being killed for this "bad thing "his son did. The movie is really fun, you see how the Sullivan live after being chased by the mafia, or a little bit of that. <br /> <br /> This film is a little sad, it tells us about revenge, these dirty jobs that people do, almost everything you love. Let's hope that the guy who reads this comment does not work for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia, do yourself a favor and get out of the hell out of the country before getting killed by your boss and their workers. <br /> This film receives: 10/10
