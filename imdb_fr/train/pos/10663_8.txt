Here's an excellent double bill Barbara Stanwyck on a record. The first film - and believe me the least of them - is MGM's "To Please A Lady" (1950), in which she is paired with Clark Gable. It is essentially a star vehicle with Gable, as usual, dominating the film with its presence on the screen. Here, he plays a macho race driver who receives a bad press from feminist journalist Stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins. Of course, after a lot of noise, they end up in each other's arms and everything closes predictably and pleasantly. A bit like a gesture, but Gable and Stanwyck, two icons of the golden age, make it visible! <br /> <br /> But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature - a wonderful and quite unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, it's a wonderful gem of a film that has not been dated yet. Here, Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and the mother of their young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and isolated beach in Mexico when a sudden tragedy occurs. A dilapidated wooden pier collapses, trapping Sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what? Yes, the tide goes up. Not a soul in sight and unable to free him, Stanwyck drives to ask for help. After traveling a certain distance, the only help she has is that of an unscrupulous escaped convict (Ralph Meeker) who, in return for his help, wants more of her than money or extra clothes ( "I will do everything to save my husband"). Is she or not? <br /> <br /> Meeker runs away with the picture! It turns into a pretty brilliant performance! Once in the movie, you simply can not leave the eyes of him! Actor in the Brando style that is smoldering, he has surprisingly never done much of his career in the movies. Although he gave splendid performances as an unsavory and disgraced cavalry officer in the remarkable dazzling western Mann / Stewart "Naked Spur" (1953) and as one of the sacrificed French soldiers condemned in the mighty drama of World War I "Paths Of Glory" (1957), his only real claim to fame was Mike Hammer's "Kiss Me Deadly" by Mickey Spillane in 1955. His performance in "Jeopardy" should have done him wonders but he had only a mediocre career in films. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> With this release, "Jeopardy" can now proudly take the rightful place as a classic black. A memorable thriller, tense and exciting thanks to great performances, John Sturges' tight direction, Victor Milner's monochrome cinematography and Dimitri Tiomkin's atmospheric score. The supplements are not great, with the exception of a radio version of "Jeopardy" and trailers for both films. <br /> <br /> This record is also part of a box set by Barbara Stanwyck celebrating her centenary. Hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 if she was still there! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - a winner of the MGM!
