I just saw this movie in preview and all I can say is ... "What I just watched ????" And I mean that in a good way and in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. Stiller and Black play with friends / neighbors. Stiller is the concentrate, the hard worker, while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo. The idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich. Black's extravagant lifestyle and the fact that he's still trying to be Stiller's best friend make Stiller mad with jealousy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is just strange. The direction is strange, with a strange opening turning into extravagant sequences. Dialog and acting is very strange; strange in a kind of disjointed way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the film, the strange song "Envy" that reappears at the scene where you think you hear a classic song of the 80s, but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> <So the real question is this ... is it funny? It depends only on the individual. I cracked the indelible spark of the film. After the screening, I heard people say that it was horribly unpleasant and happy that it was free. Strangely, I understood their argument. There are no jokes, so if you are not addicted to the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie. Hate absolutely. <br /> <br /> This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic. If you can laugh at a movie without real jokes, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you see it. If you do not do it, run away from it. It will only drive you crazy.
