A really adorable heroine who, in turn, is surprised and terrified by giblets, fights with mattresses, runs full speed in closed doors ... a few moments that shine in my memory of "The naked truth". I loved what I caught in this show: pleasures daft nice and some good side characters were used to decorate the diamond show - Tea Leoni as 'Nora Wilde'; cute, clownish and wonderfully prone to accidents - how refreshing to see an actress who knows how to clown - it's no surprise that Hollyood does not seem to know how to throw her. But where-oh-WHERE are the DVD versions? The amount of (beep) they release, it's amazing that this little gem continues to stay buried. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)
