As the Christmas celebration has evolved over the years, from religious to secular traditions, it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to one another. Ebenezer Scrooge, a merchant and lender of money in London in the 19th century, has somehow escaped his control. <br /> <br /> As his nephew points out to him, he does not keep Christmas in any way, because Scrooge feels the whole thing. is a fool. Scrooge's humanity was hunted a long time ago, a difficult case, just like his 20th century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But, as Charles Dickens has told, Redemption is not too late for any of us. A lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget about nineteenth-century British social commentary such as Oliver Twist. The characters in this film are middle and lower classes. The Cratchits are a group of bars located above the street at Oliver Twist, but they have to struggle to stay up there. Always love and happiness radiate at home, not thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did a lot of good in his life and had to remind everyone, Ebenezer Scrooge needed an awareness of the potential he had still to do in this area. old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart, in his live performances and his filmed play, has almost taken the role of Scrooge. But George C. Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this movie. The wickedness of it, but with a trace of sadness that makes us change it. Scott joins a tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, both of whom have performed Scrooge in a remarkable way. <br /> <br /> Among the minor roles, I particularly enjoyed David Warner in the role of Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward's severe Christmas gift spirit. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of the 32 versions of A Christmas Carol they have archived and this is one of the best.
