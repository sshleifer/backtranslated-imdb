"The College Girl Murders" is my first encounter with Edgar Wallace's writing work ?? and usually my first real acquaintance with "Krimi" movies in general ?? and I can say that I am moderately impressed. This thing is really fun, although I would never have imagined it like that ?? Dingo! The film presents an exhilarating and beautifully complicated plot, with a good dose of humor, flamboyant twists and quite inventive killings. Is there a type of evil brain James Bond ?? who is still sitting in the shade and in front of a big monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill some girls in a specific college with a new type of poison. There is also a naughty monk with a whip, dressed as a member of the communist KKK, getting rid of the remaining characters, as excessively inquisitive teachers, and so on. Seriously, if I had known earlier that these Krimi movies were so colorful and crazy, I would have already bought a whole collection of them. The pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it ultimately solves, and the overload of comic gadgets on Inspector Scotland Yard Higgins' account is sometimes a little hard to swallow, but I do not care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the soundtrack of the '60s stayed in my head for a long time. It's like a variant of the Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
