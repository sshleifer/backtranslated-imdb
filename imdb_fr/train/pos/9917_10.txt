It's the most confrontational documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of hidden industrial landscapes centered on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings to life issues that we have so easily chosen to disregard. <br /> <br /> Do not take any political party, this film is neutral. a moving image of the realities our Western societies choose not to inform us about - the by-products of economic growth, the externalities paid by the citizens of less developed communities, the source of our comfort and the waste of our way of life. consumption. <br /> <br /> Incredible, heartbreaking, impossible to ignore. It is a difficult but rewarding journey - please stop being ignorant and at least see these photographs of the truth without feeling the slightest pressure to take a stand on these issues. 10/10 definitely!
