In Manhattan, the American middle class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a rented apartment of four bedrooms and a bathroom. Jim works in an advertising agency that collects $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees the announcement of a huge home for sale in Connecticut at an affordable price, he goes by car with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer, Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas), sends an engineer of knowledge to inspect the house. He says he should build it and build another one. Jim checks the information with other engineers and all condemn the premises. He discovers earlier that he bought a "silver well" instead of a dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings builds his own house" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and a top-notch screenplay. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse to fulfill the American dream of owning a huge house that finds it a bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks was working on a very funny movie, obviously inspired by this charming classic, "The Money Pit". My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("My torment")
