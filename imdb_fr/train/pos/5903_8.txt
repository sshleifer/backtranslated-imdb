I liked this movie reminded me of my wedding. It's very clean, you can see it as a family. Very well done. The songs are good too. I think the screenwriter is awesome. The film shows how marriages progress over time. They have couples at different stages of life and different relationships in their lives. The film nicely describes several steps in parallel in the same story. Some dialogues are pretty good. The film portrays very well the complex human emotions, not with excessive dramatization. Also shows that perfect is not so perfect after all. Shows very well the dynamics of arranged marriage when he is new. The film is very well written and directed.
