Director Edward Sedgwick, a regular in visual comedy, successfully leads the Hal Roach road show, which features a clever and fast-changing script, as well as an excellent cast, employing a large number of reliable performers from Roach. Although the film was originally designed as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley, the sunny, plays Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repair business and goes to Hollywood, where he tries to land a role on the screen for the girl he loves, star Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as a backdrop, does it here, because Cecilia, always ready for an audition, is treated by a pretentious braggart, the movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), in action. scenes. a musical starring Broadway star Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy provide many enjoyable interludes, including their famous mink harmonica sketch, and we see beautiful turns of Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. All in all, we have to hand over the bays to Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the image of a movie star, a role he largely creates, and to the director for his clever closing tribute to Busby Berkeley's film shows. .
