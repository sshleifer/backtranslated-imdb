As usual, Hollywood stereotyped EVERYONE in the movie. But this one is a classic - from the white-collar banker to the Russian woman !! Good game. Even the facial expressions were great! The language was perfect (even in Russian) and Nicole did a wonderful job !! Hey guys - you get what you pay for :)
