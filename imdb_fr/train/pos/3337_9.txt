It's a fantastic movie for true romantics and sportsmen. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is at his best in this movie. As a fan of Drew, it was very nice to see her shine after several failures. I had doubts about Jimmy Fallon but he totally delivered as Ben the adorable comic, crazy sports. The comedy in this movie is great, there were several laughs. <br /> <br /> Their first date began when he arrived at his apartment with flowers and she was sick of belly eating a new place early in the day. Instead of going, he helps her take care of her, change her pajamas, and then clean the ass of her toilet and bathroom by telling her later that she was "very lady ... not of pieces ". All is well between Ben and Lindsay all winter but the baseball season begins. Lindsay begins to realize how much Ben is obsessed with the Red Sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single. She tries to do without it and thinks it's a good thing because she has a busy schedule and she will not feel guilty about working overtime during her games. She even buys all the books on the Red Sox she can find, including one on "The Curse of Bambino". <br /> <br /> Everything is going pretty well until Lindsay has a false alarm after she misses it. It makes them both realize how serious they are and she begins to wonder if she is the person she wants to be with. A very touching part of the film takes place after she told him that she had her period, but she unfortunately put it in order to put away a Red Sox jersey the size of a baby he had bought in case she is pregnant. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends' birthday party after she told me, "I had to check my When I saw that there was a Red Sox / Yankee match, I knew I was going off like a deer, and after the party Ben told him it was "the best night of his life". Shortly after, he received a call from his friend who went to the match. He gave up the party and said, "THIS WAS THE BEST GAME OF LIFE !!!" Ben freaks misses him and ends up having a lot of pain for Lindsay when she says, "A few minutes ago you said it was the best night of your life," he said. "It was good a few minutes ago." <br /> <br /> Then they separate for a moment, he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his subscriptions that he inherited from his uncle, because if he did not "recalls -It too much what he gave up for them ". Lindsay discovers it through a friend and decides to stop him from realizing that he is doing it for her. It ends very nicely showing how much his childhood love for baseball has been overshadowed by a whole new deeper love, Lindsay. They are still playing games and even watching the last game of the World Series and St. Louis, and everything ends well. 2 bravo !!
