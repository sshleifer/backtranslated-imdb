It is truly unfortunate that most people outside Canada think that Canada produces only snow, mountains and hockey players. This film is the second outstanding Canadian film I have seen in recent weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), far better than any exceptional Hollywood effort. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is anything but this; he is employed in a bank in Bombay in the 1970s, in middle age. This film sensitively explores different things that happened to him about his family, his friends and his work, as well as their effects on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating and, I suppose, accurate representation of the middle-class urban life in India at that time. <br /> <br /> However, I was a little prepared for that, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. As you might expect, the film can not capture all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a very good book and see a very good movie, read and see "Such a long trip".
