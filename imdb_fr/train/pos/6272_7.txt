<br /> <br /> I once saw No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and I found it correct. The film is about a guy who only steals Porsche. Gone in Sixty Seconds arrives 13 years later and adds nothing. In fact, there are many scenes that are worthless. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used ...
