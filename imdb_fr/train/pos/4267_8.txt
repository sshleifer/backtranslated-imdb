During a celebration of Kurt Weill in Brooklyn, WHERE ARE WE HERE? was finally dug up for a projection. It is amazing that a film, from any era, with collaborations between Weill and Gershwin may be missing from the screens. The score is high and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, only highlights its merits, which are considerable. Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not part of it. Ratoff is not in his element as director of this musical fantasy and Fred MacMurray can not grasp the content. In addition, the "modern" segment is weakly written. BUT the fantastic elements bring the film to a high mark, as does the work of the two charming leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work. As a tribute to the history of our country during the Second World War, even in a "never been" setting, the film has its place in the Hollywood music history and should be available for all to discover the considerable merits.
