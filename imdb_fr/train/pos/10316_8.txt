Remember these two stories with tenderness and in the first, in the not too distant future, we see a young boy getting ready for the day of the exam, the i.q. The boy is a bit puzzled about his parents' concerns because some of his friends have already done so and end up doing the test. Upon arrival, he receives an injection and is curious to know why. The examiner smiles and tells him it's just to make sure he's telling the truth. The boy then asks, again puzzled, why would not he? It is later and the parents are sitting, worried, in front of the screen when a message appears and declares that the state is sorry, but the level iq of their son has exceeded the national quotient and asks politely they would like a private burial. A corker of a concluding scene! A message of charity is a story that warms the heart and highlights the tenuous mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. This leads to a strange story of accusations of witchcraft in the past and digs in the pages of history of the present. A beautiful story with a comforting conclusion.
