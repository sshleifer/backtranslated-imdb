"Xizao", is the story about the shock of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter from his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) is dead. He discovers that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old business, the public toilets. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Da Ming's family and explains how he should learn the importance of his father's work, something he had always considered an old tradition that was soon to disappear . In addition, the film explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally handicapped, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the film, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well managed, and the film never loses sight of what it tries to say, the two themes are very good developed and we glimpse the Chinese society and customs. . <br /> <br /> The director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple way, letting the characters play the role. It's a very simple approach, but it's perfect for the film, and I doubt very much that another style would suit the film as well. Zhang has huge potential because he can tell a story without the help of visual flare or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The acting game is remarkable for its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks like they were real filmed people. The three main characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang like Er Ming surely steals the star. <br /> <br /> Even when the film could stick to a message "The good old days were much better", it must on the contrary attitude of balance, as saying that progress is good, and that we must move forward, but we must not forget where we come from and keep a balance between modern life and the traditions of the past. <br /> <br /> and touching movie. 8/10
