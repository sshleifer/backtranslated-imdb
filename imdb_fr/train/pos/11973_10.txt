Full House is a wonderful sitcom that talks about a father, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. Danny asks his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis, and his best friend, Joey Gladstone, to help his three daughters, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. It's my favorite show and I can watch it all day long. And something about Full House always makes me laugh and there are also sad passages. There is never a moment of boredom in Full House. The main characters are: Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen ( Michelle Tanner).
