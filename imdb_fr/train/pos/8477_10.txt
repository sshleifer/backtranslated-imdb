in a less conventional sense of the term. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a young kid, and I recently remembered it and thought about it. Although many details are not clear in my mind, the general feeling that gave me the film has held me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes, then I highly recommend this movie. It taught me a lot about life and death, and caused me a lot of emotion. To this day, it remains one of my favorite movies.
