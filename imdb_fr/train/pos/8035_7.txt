Sunday would not be Sunday without action film, and when you want an intense fight, you talk to Tom Berenger (peloton). <br /> <br /> Here he is playing a sniper in the jungle in pursuit of rebels and drug lords. Life is a bitch, so he has a green desk guy (Billy Zane) to help him with his mission. <br /> <br /> The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who sits Anaconda. it does not do much better here, but Berenger makes the film worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, he may be a bit long - who wants to see a lot of walking in the jungle, but it's good, tense action at the right time.
