The film transported everyone until October 20, 1944, when we seemed to be part of the big Filipino landing stage 'I Shall Return' ?? Is it on this coast of Leyte that General MacArthur made himself known? <br /> <br /> Above all, Gregory Peck triumphed in his portrait of the great general ?? It's the stride, the set of shoulders, the intensity ?? This is what the two men have in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion ?? With MacArthur it was for the army ?? With Peck, it was the challenge to act ?? Winner of Academy Award for "To Kill a Mockinbird", Academy Award nominee for "Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentleman's Agreement" and "Twelve O'Clock High", he played everything, apparently homicide amnesiac to a journalist of the crusade; from a troubled shooter to an obsessed lawyer; from David Biblical to Captain Horatio Hornblower? He brought to all his unique insight, his character, his sincerity, his warmth and his love, and above all his humor ?? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where "MacArthur" is on deck with the "President of the Philippines". We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope that the water will not be too deep," said the "president", "because my people will discover that I do not know how to swim". Then comes the sounding voice of Peck: "And my people will find that I can not walk on the water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur", Peck has once again justified its reputation as a giant in the film industry. Through him, we felt the emotions of MacArthur: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with all his family ??
