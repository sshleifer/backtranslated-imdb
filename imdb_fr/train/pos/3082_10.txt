What's really sad, shows like Six Degree and Brothers & Sisters are true reality TV, not garbage that's nothing but glorified TV games. I think that the wave of discontent reigns in recent years, with the premature cancellation of many shows followed by worship. But with the stronger reaction from fans of Jericho (which I also appreciate) and other shows, the networks could start to reverse this trend. I am like others, I will not support any new show until they have received a second season. I will then eventually make the decision to watch and catch up with DVDs and online viewing. Until then ABC, you lost me as a spectator of ANY new show.
