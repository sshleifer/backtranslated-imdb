I heard that Madonna was briefly considered for the role of Catherine Tremell. Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is too coarse and BAUERISCH. She is not even close. <br /> <br /> EVIL INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a little long in the tooth, despite the beneficial effects of modern chemistry and surgery. However, it cleverly treats us as a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. In the obligatory sex scene, she projects a pure and crystalline lust. Especially his hooded and bright eyes and his flat face of pleasure. Thanks to the brilliant use of lighting and other scenic techniques, the rough lines of the age only appear occasionally. On the contrary, she seems to have a slight golden glow (YES, YEATS). <br /> <br /> The places gave us a view of London which is a welcome departure from the usual Londonscapes. The character of Catherine is so powerful and threatening that I thank my lucky stars that our paths have never crossed. I would not have had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT; ATTEMPTING TO CENSURE: I have to comment briefly on the original 1992 film, taking place in San Francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. It's exceptional, from music to places, through sets, etc. Paul Verhoven drew some striking performances from the cast and the team. <br /> <br /> The fact that the main character of Baddie is a woman has not escaped the surveillance of groups of gay and lesbian activists in the Bay Area. Attempts to censor have been categorically denied. INFLATE. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control of the script, insisting on rewriting in order to promote their political and psychiatric programs. Example: Discriminatingly claiming sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be changed from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. <br /> <br /> In San Francisco, gentle and tolerant activists did their best to sabotage scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. Executive producers Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna vowed to fight against any effort to restrict the guaranteed artistic freedom in our democracy and obtained restrictive orders against disruption tactics. <br /> <br /> BLOWBACK: Thanks to these lightning activists, the film has huge coverage in the national press - millions of dollars in free advertising. Their calls to viewers to boycott the film provoked a brutal reaction that kept customers waiting for long queues each time the film was released. He was also hailed by critics. It was, to use the words of NETWORK's reptilian Hackett, "a big hit!" Sorry, nice reader; I could not resist that one. Yes, it's a joke. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that BASIC INSTINCT 1 AND 2, with their brilliant scores, their aesthetics and their acting, are works of art that deserve to be protected by our Constitution .
