It's a great action movie with a great Arnie movie! It is done with elegance, with a lot of tense action so that one remains satisfied. The characters were great, and Richard Dawson is very threatening as the main villain. Yes, there are lots of holes in the plot, but it's very entertaining, with a nice ending too. There was a beautiful story too, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had excellent chemistry together. The development of the character was also very good, with great performances. The staging is great! Paul Michael Glaser does a very good job here, with great use of colors, an elegant style, impressive shooting angles and, overall, a very fast film! good work. There is a little gore. We have some bloody gunshot wounds, an exploding head, a slit throat, chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood and a stalemate. The game is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is amazing, as always, he is excellent in the acting department, has tons of hilarious liners, kicks ass, and, as always, is a great physical presence! And was really fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, does well here, she was really cute and had good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre is good as the geek guy, he was cool! Richard Dawson is awesome as the main villain and was very very threatening, and he was fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland Van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka are all doing what they have to do well as stalkers. Overall, you have to see! **** 1/2 out of 5
