I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were present because they had already played in some of my favorite movies. When I watched Valentine, I was amazed at how fantastic the story was. It kills me to see that his rating is low because it was not horrible at all. The actors and actresses played the roles perfectly and the end was brilliant and cunning. Some scenes were a little incredible and / or mediocre, and I admit that in a few small scenes, it's a bit boring, but overall it was entertaining and suspenseful. There was a breathtaking story that left you guessing all along and did not deserve all the shit that entails. I recommend this movie to watch at any time, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it will not fail to give you tons of chills. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer OR the rating, please, DO NOT ...
