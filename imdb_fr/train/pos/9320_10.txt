MGM MINIATURE Short Subject. <br /> <br /> The publisher of Cole County Clarion must decide what is the REALLY IMPORTANT NEW for its readers: an impending freeze that could disrupt their cultures, or a dramatic destruction of a notorious gangster in the main street of their little town. <br /> <br /> It's a good little one-reel, with a good performance from comic Charles 'Chic' Sale. Today's viewers may be more interested in the appearance of uncredited James Stewart as Sale's nephew / assistant. Speaking slowly and a little clumsy, Stewart shows many attributes that would make a huge star in a very short time. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, short one- and two-reel topics have been useful to the studios as important training grounds for new talent or talent, in front and behind the camera. The dynamic to create a successful short film was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a short short to the pitch of a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and schedule and able to represent a wide range of materials, the short subjects are the perfect complement to the feature films of the Studios.
