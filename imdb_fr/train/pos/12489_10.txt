First of all, no one can understand why this movie has such a bad rating. It's not just the first real horrible movie for a long time for me, which is rather boiled in the water and has many decades of experience in the horror field. Secondly, the lead actress, Cheri Christian, has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in the big pictures of the future. Third, this woman is so wonderfully beautiful that I suggest to the directors to remove all those Cameron Diaz, Eva Mendezes, and how the names of these ephemeral bulbs are. Madame Christian is not a light, but a sun. <br /> <br /> However, "The dark remains" are also of considerable metaphysical importance. Their idea that the photographs show creatures of the intermediary between reality and "imagination" that are not visible with their own eyes is not new. But I have never seen in a film before that these creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and at certain times. This means that the photo is not simply an iconic image of reality (whereby reality is transformed into a sign), but becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as "real" reality. As a sign, the change of image means that it influences the photographed objects, that is to say that the sign behaves like an object. Now, in our usual world of perception, it is common for objects to change their sign. Eg, if someone raises a bird, his picture will show him with a beard, not without, as before. But on the contrary, the change of objects by signs would imply that the photo with the beard is first and only then that the beard develops on the man. This is, very simply expressed, the case that occurs with the photos taken by the main character of the prison, in this film. This is new, and we must be grateful for all that is new in horror movies, which usually rehearse and reorder previously known effects and features, mostly since the time of silence.
