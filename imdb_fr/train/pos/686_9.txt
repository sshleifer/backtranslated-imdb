Ghost Story (The Telefilm - 1972) was the pilot of the NBC series. The film was well written and well played and, I thought, when the 1972-73 television season started, if the TV series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on video!) The series was a huge disappointment - even with William Castle as an exec. producer. If, however, you have the chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, go see it. You will not be disappointed.
