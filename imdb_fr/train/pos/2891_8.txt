Last night, we watched the movie "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC, and I came to the conclusion that things had to be closer to "the mouse" than usual. <br /> <br /> Since this film lasts only 74 minutes and it took two hours of airtime on television, they had, and I do not invent, commercial breaks of 6 at 7 O'clock. minutes. And during these commercial breaks, they had another advertisement in the guise of a "television show" animated by the annoying Kelly Rippa who proclaimed loud and clear the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: dreams come true" . <br /> Again and again, pause after break, Disney pulled out of the real movie the time it had to tell us, faithful viewers, that we needed a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for entrusting us with the task of creating a sequel to your beloved film gem. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this mercantilism and the ringing of the box made it difficult the task of real movie of "Cinderella", because at the end of the commercials, I had forgotten where the history had stopped. <br /> <br /> But of course, the original movie "Cinderella" still retains its magic and the story is always good, although we have all seen it countless times. It's a shame that they had to sell it with all the marketing for what appears to be a lame follow-up.
