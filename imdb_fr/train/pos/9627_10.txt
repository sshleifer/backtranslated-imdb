This is by far the funniest short film made by the two comic genies. From the moment they come on the scene, until Hardy falls from the roof, it makes me laugh hysterically. I strongly suggest that all fans of Laurel and Hardy should see this short film. I also recommend all Ghost series. If you're looking for laughter, watch this movie and you'll be happy.
