In a year of pretentious mud like "Synecdoche, New York", a film born of Charlie Kaufman's own indulgence, is a film that is just as difficult to watch but about three times larger. "Frownland" is a work of love made by the team, the actors and the filmmaker, filmed over the years by friends. It traces a man who can not communicate through his real and genuinely real world, the Brooklyn world. The people you see go beyond the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people, trapped in their own neuroses, reluctant to change, incapable. For them, the real world is made up of their own delusions and, as it is a film about people so deeply disconnected from reality, it is very hard to watch. It's a 16mm film without proper light, no money, and no other factors that make a movie "slippery", but its honesty can not be underestimated, which would make a room full people reject it Linklater awards him a prize, as he did at SXSW. It reminds of movies like "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It's a movie that does not suit everyone, but it challenges you to watch and grows up with you longer.
