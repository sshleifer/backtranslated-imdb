McConaughey in a horror thriller? I had to see that. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is told in flashback mode and concerns a family of three normally normal and happy people going through a very strange situation. I can not say more without ruining the whole movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to look at it, you will be, at least, surprised. <br /> <br /> All the main actors are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job directing these kids, and his acting is awesome. McConaughey's acting game is solid and fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film challenges you to think. Is daddy crazy? Is there a god? Do demons exist? How far would you go to correct a wrong. And what is the "right" anyway? I always think. <br /> <br /> And I therefore recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and it's one of those films that deserves and rewards a second or even a third viewing.
