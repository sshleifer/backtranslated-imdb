I really do not like Shrek's two films. (Since their two "PG" and containing words, I would never say, so I hated them.) <br /> <br /> But as for "Spirit: the stallion of the Cimarron", which I Just watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animated movies other than Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead *** In "Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron", a foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard. One night, he sees a strange light in the distance and he walks towards her. This action eventually leads to his capture and many other things. Throughout the film, we hear a narration. It is through the thoughts of the Spirit, although the horses never speak. That's what makes the movie so good. They (the filmmakers) have recovered real horses to make the sounds that the horses made; none of these sounds were emitted by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, an American native, who owns it. Little Creek later releases Spirit and Rain, they will run home. <br /> <br /> I have never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I intend to buy the soundtrack of this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
