I doubt that much of this film is based on a true story. At first, it's based on a true story, sort of. I bet the only truth is that there was an old model turned bounty hunter, probably named Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he starts by talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is questioned about what she knows about a $ 10 million robbery. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then a model, and how she became interested in becoming a bounty hunter. It essentially tells two other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. She is strong, can use any type of weapon and will use her appearance if she needs it. <br /> <br /> They are involved in a scam to which Clarmont, a backer, goes. Along the way, the group launches a reality show in which Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green get involved. They are a bit like hosts and must really be desperate. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was fun and she laughed a little. The editing did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly with guns and blood. It could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICTO: Good enough to watch.
