Excellent show. Rather than watching the same sitcom-style shows, but with different "stars," this refreshing show offered an incredibly entertaining view of the office. We did not watch any television for 2 years and after our return, we look forward to watching this show on W. Shame on Global for disconnecting this show. I thought this one would be a winner. Let's be realistic about something, PEW Canadian SHOWS does it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I think it was silly for Global to leave. I imagine they want to stick to the typical scary show of the United States instead of being left behind by a very promising Canadian show. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of shows on TV, but, go on, let's keep the variety. This unique show offered a very comical view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships, with unique characters that are not seen in sitcoms today or in the past. Too bad that Global had to say no to this one, stupid mistake.
