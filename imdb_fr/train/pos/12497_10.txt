If you have not seen this Mary-Kate and Ashley movie yet, then all I can say is, "What are you waiting for ?!" This is another wonderful and wonderful film of the fraternal twins we all know and love! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathtaking (as far as landscapes are concerned)! Of course; Mary-Kate and Ashley are as usual the main set here! Would a real fan want it otherwise? Of course not! Anyway; it's a good movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not already seen it, you just have to do it now! I mean now too! So what are you waiting for? I promise you will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
