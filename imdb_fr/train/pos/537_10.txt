For me, a question of life and death is simply the best film ever made. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, it's full of class. It is stimulating, sobering, a mirror of the post-war world and relations between peoples. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply beautiful and the effect of mixing monochrome and Technicolor to accentuate different worlds works seamlessly. The development of characters and plot is almost perfect and the attention to detail promotes a fantasy quite credible. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I've watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. It's as fresh today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I were allowed to keep and watch a movie again, this film would be a matter of life and death.
