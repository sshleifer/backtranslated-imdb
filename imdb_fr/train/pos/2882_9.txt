Cinderella was one of the first films I saw and it is timeless for me. It's a beautiful film, with a beautiful animation. My favorite animation scene was the sartorial scene. I love these mice. The songs are as charming, not as good as those of Snow White, but they are a pleasure to sing and remind Tchaikovsky. A dream is a wish and so it's love? are standout. The characters are also a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided a great comic relief. The half-sisters were also well done, as well as Lucifer. But I liked the best mother-in-law, she was really perverse, compared to a big character in the name of the fairy godmother. It's true, the movie hangs out a bit, with the mice's antics, but they were really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overestimated, underestimated, you mean? He rarely plays on television, but the very bad sequel does it regularly on Cinemagic. If you want an excellent adaptation of Cinderella, try the wonderful Ever After, or the sumptuous Slipper and the Rose, which is not as good. But whatever you do, avoid the rest, which I have the mistake of possessing, because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
