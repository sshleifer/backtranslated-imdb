After being published by Dickens in 1837, OLIVER TWIST was going to be successful after the controversy. His portrayal of life in urban ghettos was shocking and new, and the fact that he embodied criminals and criminals was another innovation. <BR /> <br /> One day he was walking in London and met a young woman with whom he was friends. He said hello, but she was rather stiff with him. He could not understand that. A few days later, they saw each other and he asked him what he had done to upset her. "Well, if you must know, I did not like your latest novel," she said. "Really, everyone likes it." He was perplexed: "What's wrong with that?" "Oh, Charles," she said, "I'm Jewish, how can you create a character like Fagin ?!" He had not expected that: "Well ... you know last year's trial of Ikey Solomon, the thief's coach, he is a model for Fagin and he was Jewish." <br /> <br /> Dickens found that it did not fix things. "Yes," she replied, "He got what he deserved, but Charles, they did not call him" Solomon the Jew ", as you call Fagin" the Jew "! Fagin is doing it. " Dickens had to admit he could have been swept away. He left thinking of what she had said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist has been published in several editions. Dickens tried to improve a little Fagin. Then he had an idea. He reworked the chapter entitled "The Last Night of Fagin", showing the man's fears of hanging. He also added some additional details. <br /> <br /> He informed his friend of his determination to change Fagin. A day or two later, he met her at a friend's house. She looked at him like he was crazy. "Did not you like the changes?", He asked. "Charles, what's changing?" He's still a nasty villain called "the Jew"! ", She replied. "Yes, I kept them inside, but you did not see how scared he was in the cell of death in prison." The young woman had noticed that, but felt he was so bad he deserved such fears. "Ah ... so I was right about it ... and did you see the little details I added?", He asked. "What details?", She replied. "When you see Fagin for the first time, he prepares his own dinner ... did you read that?" Looked at her, waiting for him with a sign of gratitude. Instead the lady seemed confused. "I read he was by the fireside, but I had to go through the passage." Dickens smiled as if he were brilliant. "He's preparing a pork sausage for his dinner." "A what!" If she exclaimed. "He's eating pork, sweetheart ... you see - he's not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook his head and left his friend's house to his dismay. She did not talk to him for years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never totally left his fanatic spirit, but the situation led to a partial attempt to amend his latest novel. In OUR AMI MUTUAL (1865), he has a minor character, Mr. Riah, who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants. The owner thinks that Mr. Riah will be blamed because he is Jewish. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very good man - good enough to be amazing. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action, he would probably chase him with a stick. <br /> <br /> The anti-Semitic image of Fagin has endured to this day. It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes him. However, by presenting the story on film, this always poses problems for writers and directors: how, after the Holocaust, can we treat a film worthy of a novel without igniting sectarianism? David Lean showed how, by showing Alec Guiness in one or two scenes showing a human side and facing a crowd in the end with real dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel, did it even better, thanks to a rewrite of the scenario of the original musical comedy. <br /> <br /> OLIVER had been turned into a West End musical hit in the mid-1960s, and then taken to Broadway where it was still a hit. With a magnificent score of Lionel Bart, including "Food Glorious Food", "I review the situation", "Consider yourself", "Boy to sell", "Who will buy", "As long as he needs me, "he deserved his success. Reed played well, including his nephew Oliver Reed (Sykes), Ron Moody (Fagin), Mark Lester (Oliver), Jack Wild (Dodger), Shani Wallis (Nancy) and Harry Secombe (Mr. Bumble). There has not been a huge musical success in Hollywood for a decade - the last musical to win the Oscar for best film was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fagin - how to deal with the eternal problem of caricature? Although in the musical Fagin is not captured, tried and executed for the murder committed. After all, even Lean showed Fagin that he was trying to control his confederate in his actions. But here, Fagin realizes that he has become too old to depend on this kind of unstable life. Although he loses his treasures (those stolen objects he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty), he decides that he can reform himself. He is authorized to do so, accompanied by his faithful sidekick, the Artful Dodger. I do not think Dickens would have appreciated the change (his friend might have), but a modern audience certainly accepts it.
