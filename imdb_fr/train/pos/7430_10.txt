Personally, I loved this film and it particularly moved me. The two main actors offer us such a performance that in the end, it is really heartbreaking to know what has finally happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is wonderful, and the song is just awesome as it is. <br /> <br /> That's why I was not surprised to learn that he had won five Golden Globes (the most awarded Golden Globes film), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This film is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. A big film that has often been criticized (maybe because Streisand dared to get involved, surely as a "co-director"). His art is the greatest, and you will surely like it!
