There is really nothing to complain about "The Odd Couple" and it is not surprising that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau form an extremely winning comedy team. But Neil Simon's adaptation to his hit play has something so underdeveloped that it's more like a skit from a comedy sketch than a full-bodied movie. I have not seen the play, but I must assume that the screen version is fairly faithful, since Simon wrote it, so that the defects can not be attributed to a step-by-step adaptation. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately fall into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither of them know each other differently - that Simon never fully disclosed . Still, there are many worst ways to kill a few hours.
