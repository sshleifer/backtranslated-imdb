I watched this movie on DVD many times now, the first time I watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour. A captivating and entertaining film, thank God, no kiera knightley, it's refreshing and it gives us all a glimpse of Queen Victoria's difficult life and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie, no really bad language or anything of a sexual nature that would offend the family. May encourage children to learn a little about Queen Victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
