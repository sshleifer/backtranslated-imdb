I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We had a crate of beer and watched this classic! He lost NONE of his original freshness in kung fu! If you are a fan of kung-fu / karate movies, this is a must ... DVD is available. I think this film is also called "Choose your poison". <br /> <br /> Watch it soon!
