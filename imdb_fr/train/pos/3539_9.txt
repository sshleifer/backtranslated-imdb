Good: cinematic incendiary fights, excellent presentation, vehicles are fun to drive, multiplayer rather attractive, faithful to the film, and the list is long. <br /> <br /> Bad: the main missions are a bit short. <Br/> <br /> This game defines what is a "good" third person shooter (not necessarily a spy game). Great battles embody history and make you want to finish EVERY mission and unlock all the authentic bonuses the game has to offer. The hype that this game has had, has been lived up to, and I personally think you should buy it, and connect with a couple of friends and play this one. A lot of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The sound of this game is a feat of several previous links games, and shooting with a weapon really gives the impression of shooting with a weapon. This corresponds to the fact that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> In the end, this game makes you enthusiastic and satisfied after your passage, and a multiplayer mode able to compete with the standards of James Bond's clever gambling "Nightfire" for gamecube.
