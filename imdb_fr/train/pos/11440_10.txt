I went to see Rivers and Tides again today. This is the second time in two days and yes, I see movies that I love as many times as necessary. Yesterday, I was struck by the brilliance of Goldsworthy's images and works. This morning, when I threw the coins, I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence its title. I received the 5th changing line that was moved to No. 7 Army. For Blake Art was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few online reviews of the SF Examiner. The reviewer liked the movie, but said Goldsworthy's comments prevented him from enjoying it. He would rather have only the pictures and the wonderful soundtrack. I was aware of it as I watched this second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, I was thinking of voting for Andy Goldsworthy as king of the world. Well, today I could go beyond the images and listen to what he had to say. Can I enjoy the movie without his comments? What he does, what he says goes well beyond "art". His understanding of water, time, stone, change, etc. made me think that man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar. Some of his works / words are like Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, the film is only (apparently) shown here in the Bay Area. Be a trendsetter. Go to the movies in your neighborhood and tell them that they should not demand that they book a movie you've heard from the backcountry. It's called rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
