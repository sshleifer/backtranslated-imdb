Overall, the movie is OK. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of history, sentimental value. <br /> <br /> Some scenes touch me. Yes I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) played his part very well. Brilliant. I can say that his game is almost natural. <br /> <br /> However, the song "Do not leave me" by Nina Simone is really "menaikkan" my "bulu" "roma" ". <br /> I like the song. the song "Do not Leave Me" and "Hujan" I just downloaded the song Beautiful .. <br /> <br /> And hello to Yasmin The final credit of the film makes me feel again. that Yasmin really enjoyed his parents in a unique way. <br /> <br /> I think the film deserves this Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 out of 10 stars.
