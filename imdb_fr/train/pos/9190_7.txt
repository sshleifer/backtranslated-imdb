Two things happen while Tony is seriously injured in a coma. Tony imagines himself leading the life of a sales assistant attending a business convention, while his family and friends try in vain to face the possible loss of the great man. The dream sequences come straight from an old episode of TWILIGHT ZONE, while Tony sees himself transformed into an average Joe trying to handle a missing wallet and confused identities on a business trip across the country . His intonation as a schnook dressed in blazer and khaki is rather American and less than that of an Italian thug Noo Joisey. A nice touch. AJ, a long-haired, shocking dippy hippie (whom Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at one point) has a nice scene with her comatose old man. The best time is when big boys try to talk about life without Tony, which immediately turns into territorial conflict. Vito does not understand that Gene, who has just died, may have been a secret affair, which is interesting considering what we are about to learn about Vito.
