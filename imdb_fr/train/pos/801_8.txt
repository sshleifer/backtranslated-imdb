I suppose that JEDI is now considered chronologically as the "last" entry of the popular saga, and it is a very good one, as are many of them. I liked the fact that this suite took off directly after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and I enjoyed the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they were not that bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase in the woods and I felt that there was a lot of emotion well done with this chapter. The end (with some new additions, I presume?) Successfully weaves the 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy story. I know that a lot of real Star Wars fans have hated George Lucas for the changes to the original movies, but being relatively new to these movies pretty late in life and not lacking in what I did not already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. Oh, and, uh - Carrie Fisher looked really sweet in her skinny outfit.
