I have seen this film at least 4 times since 1984 and it is always good every time I see it. This is a very convincing version of the Carmen opera, with excellent flamenco dances, nude decorations and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This narration of Carmen is a story in one story, each other, until the end doubly tragic. Obviously, this low-budget Spanish production contains dances of some of Spain's greatest flamenco dancers. The combination of the surging opera and the sound of the dancing boots on the wooden stage makes the tale of the story even more powerful. <br /> <br /> This is an independent film at its best and probably my favorite all time foreign movie.
