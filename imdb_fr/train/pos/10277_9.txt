It's almost a perfect movie. The ideas would be taken up by Mamet, but never say so succinctly. It's really about the failure of trust, the human condition. The film suggests that we are all criminals and no one is innocent. Is there anyone alive today who has not seen this happen in our own society every day? The film is very structured like a Hitchcock thriller. Except that there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, in ruins and everyone participates in the con. Nothing more true? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. That's wonderful.
