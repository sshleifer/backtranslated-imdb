I saw the new version reissued and modified yesterday and I loved it. Then I went home and watched it with subtitles and I liked it. I'm ready to watch it again. <br /> <br /> I am a supporter of the secret identity with soft manners and what is sweeter than a pacifist librarian? The scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or forgetfully forget to be sweet are my favorites. <br /> <br /> Of course, the martial arts are stunning. I can not really say anything if you know the hk style. However, if you are not ... we briefly suspended reading and Walker, Texas Ranger was activated. We found that after each strike, there was a break. Not in the black mask. <br /> <br />
