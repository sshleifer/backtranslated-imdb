This animated film is a masterpiece! The storytelling, the music, the animation and the script are all remarkable. My friend and I saw him a second time and we had a closer look. We invited some friends to see Spirit with us and they enjoyed it. When I asked them to come see him, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek, which remind me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who smiles a lot in Dances With Wolves. The mind has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found invigorating and inspiring. <br /> <br /> I saw the spirit for the third time and wish to see it again. I really liked "Spirit" because his portrayal of Native Americans is realistic, dignified and non-stereotypical, unlike the movie "The Road to El Dorado", which was a total joke because it portrayed the American Indians so much. disrespectful and stereotyped. But Dreamworks has redeemed itself by making Spirit an excellent movie that I found acceptable! I hope they will continue to make more animated films like Spirit, and I'd like to see Spirit's sequels or spin-offs if done with respect and without stereotyping Native Americans. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to those who have an open mind to pay to see Spirit: stallion Cimarron.
