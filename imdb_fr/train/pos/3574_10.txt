It's hard to tell sometimes why exactly a movie is so effective. From the moment I came across "The Stone Boy", something told me it would be a good movie. Despite this, it seemed very unlikely that I would ever have the opportunity to see him myself. Then, one day, while browsing the online catalog of my local library, I noticed that they had recently bought the DVD version of this film. What I am extremely happy about, because the cinematography is of a breathtaking depth and quality that an old VHS copy could never reproduce. <br /> <br /> And speaking of cinematography, I have to distinguish it as much as possible. the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer who pursues pretty much the exact visual style described in "The Stone Boy", I firmly believe that a great filmmaker can almost single-handedly make a film. Here, he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast and a director who understands perfectly what history needs. But having Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a behind the camera makes almost every scene a little bit of beauty. And you can almost never say that. Most movies would never expect such a thing from you. Scene after scene, some details and a little visual magic to take your breath away. <br /> <br /> The director, Christopher Cain, had a long and interesting career. As far as I know, this film is not very representative. But sometimes, to surprise a director at the very beginning of his career, before all the big budgets and this loss of concentration, it is necessary to find a real subtle magic. Cain takes a step back in this film, let things happen a life of its own, then further. Like the early John Sayles movies, the characters have the opportunity to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because they do, and that's how life is. Cain displays a remarkable, raw, even downright painful understanding of human nature in this film. <br /> <br /> The acting game combines much of this story. When people speak, when they exist in this film, they do it as real people, without being restrained by the fact that they play characters. Gina Berriault's screenplay allows extremely talented and respected actors such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Frederic Forrest to simply spend time. Whether they have something to say that is minor or of profound significance, the weight of pure reality is needed. <br /> <br /> When you look at the actors involved, or the beautiful soundtrack of James Horner, it seems strange that such a film is almost forgotten. Perhaps a big part of what makes "The Stone Boy" what it is was the period in which it was made. There is this 1970s hangover feeling in this picture that deeply reminds me of my own childhood. People talk about the 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but it's not the 80s that I lived in or remember. The look of the images, the sober and dark quality of the actor and the end result should put under the skin of those who grew up at that time in North America or at a time close to it. I see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. And a film like "The Stone Boy" sees the world as it should be. <br /> <br /> To learn more about this feeling, visit: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
