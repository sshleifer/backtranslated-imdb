In my years of attending film festivals, I've seen a lot of little movies like this one that are never released in movie theaters and end up in WalMart's $ 3 bins. I just found the DVD of Yank Tanks there, excellent doc, but how sad that this film becomes an infernal background. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I would have liked to see it in the cinema that's all. I wish that New Yorker Films translated the title directly. It's good that the Americans are stretching a little. If the title of the film helps the American public explore random chaos, so much the better. The cinema imitates life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found it disturbing that the subtitles set prices in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to understand, let the Gringo public do the math. Seeing a movie, especially a shot in Paris, the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by a reminder: I am an American who watches a movie and translates me the euros in dollars. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see more actors and more about the author and the director.
