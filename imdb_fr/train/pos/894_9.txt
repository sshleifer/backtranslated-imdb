This, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite Sammo Hung movies. The Fat Dragon is bigger in this release than he was in "Condors", but he is no less sure of himself as a director or actor. In fact, he is at the top of his game and delivers a devastating and brutal actor who has half a dozen amazing sequences and also manages to tell a story of compassionate love. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious complements to the action and ensure that viewers do not press the fast forward button between physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which features a funny lightsaber duel, sets a solid but misleading tone. A sequence in which Sammo's pedicab is pursued by a car is beautifully staged and softened with a lively and comical tone. The fast and furious brawl between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a dazzling and precise model of superb choreography, and easily one of the best of its kind. The film's violence intensifies slowly until, finally, when the confrontation reaches its climax, we undergo some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a Sammo production. The director / actor's onslaught on Billy Chow and a house filled with menacing and angry opponents is a bone-cracking, physically-boring delight. <br /> <br /> Awesome at all levels and one of the best martial arts movies ever made. <br /> <br /> High score, too.
