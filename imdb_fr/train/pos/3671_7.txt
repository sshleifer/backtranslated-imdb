"Hollywood North" is a euphemism for the film industry as they go to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and lower costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case, later on. Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, has probably seen many Californian invaders say that this film seems to be the right way to deal with the personalities who arrive to try to capitalize on the economy presented by Canada. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern", the best-selling novel written by a Canadian author is transformed into "Flight to Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original movie. Michael Baytes, obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is offered the main role, which turns out to be a disaster. <br /> <br /> The film seems to say that too many cooks have spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case of the final product, which is backed by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who made a documentary about the movie being filmed in Toronto, parts of the film are finally transformed into a coherent movie. <br /> <br /> The filming process is hilarious, and the acting game, in general, is good.
