Otto Preminger's classic black works almost like LAURA's backhand ... while this film was glitzy and features Clifton Webb, a colorful film, this film is much more appealing. Dana Andrews is a good cop who accidentally kills a man only to drop him potentially on the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving quickly, so logic errors are easily overlooked. Andrews is very good (much less wood than before) and the incredible beauty of Gene Tierney is incredibly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must-have and a great companion for WHIRLPOOL (also playing with Tierney) from Preminger.
