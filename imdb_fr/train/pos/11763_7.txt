I guess everyone has to come back at some point. And that's exactly what Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), an embarrassed Taft resident, intends to do in "The Best of Times". Yes, the man who became completely crazy with the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" plays football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that costs a prestigious title at his high school. But former teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) is not going to just accept it so easily. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a very good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you a laugh (to say the least). Check it out.
