A collapse in a nuclear power station causes a majority of people to turn into deadly, dark-faced, shattering zombies, who naturally engage in frightful rampage. A handful of uninfected people are doing their best to survive this grueling ordeal. The director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets displays an attractive and sincere love and passion for an unbridled and frightful horror cuisine: he maintains a steady, flawless pace, fills the screen with a crazy wall. action, and fortunately keeps the dialogue terrible to a pleasant minimum. In addition, Sheets certainly does not skimp on the super excessively graphic and excessive splashes: this image offers a delicious load of melting flesh, evisceration, a lot of intestinal nibbles, a guy has a broken heart, and there is even a beautiful impaling on a tree branch. Sheets earns bonus points by keeping the tone dark and vicious to the very end (for example, almost all the main characters eventually become zombies). Admittedly, this film has its share of defects: the ragged mounting, several attempts of pathos with fist, and the play of the actor to say the least horrible, of a class without name, leave much to be desired. The most remarkable honors go to the pretty and joyous Kasey Rausch for his brave and seductive portrait of the resourceful Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay is also doing his job well as an army veteran, Ralph Walsh. Better yet, Sheets perfectly understands the contagious meaning of slambang and its obvious affinity as well as its obvious affinity for the genre of horror, making it an explosion to look from end to end.
