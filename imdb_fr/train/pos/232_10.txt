What a delicious movie. The characters were not only alive but alive, reflecting the real life of everyday life and the conflicts within a family. Each character brought to the story a unique personality that the public could easily associate with an acquaintance of their entourage or within their own family. <br /> <br /> The story follows a faithful unfolding that the viewer can assimilate and be part of the drama, laughter and tears that the plot of the film develops. The script captures emotions, actions, and the characters' common reactions to conflict, opinion, and resolution. <br /> <br /> It's not an epic, but it's a great movie to watch with your loved ones. A lot of knowing nods and "ahhh" moments to share and appreciate.
