All I can say is the first film of this season that caught my attention. I chose it because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story seemed promising. I just watch it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, it's true ... but that's what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, these things are happening right now. And there are experts who try to change things and make things better and who do not care about their commitment to the cause. In fact, I can not feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and that's what makes it better. Claire and Richard both played a big role and deserve a 10 from me.
