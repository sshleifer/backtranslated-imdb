"Moonstruck" is a love story. There is not one novel, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She does not like him, but he is a sweet and good man. When he goes to visit his dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). Johnny and he have not spoken for five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they fall instantly for each other. <br /> <br /> The way this story and the love stories of Loretta's parents, uncle and aunt are developing is something you simply have to see for yourself. Each view is a pleasure to watch, with Cher as a brilliant star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year. Cage is very good and crazy too. Olympia Dukakis as mother of Loretta and Vincent Gardenia as her father are fantastic. This film is funny, charming and so very nice.
