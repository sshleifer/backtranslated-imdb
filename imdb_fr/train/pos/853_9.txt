"The matador" interprets Pierce Brosnan as an exhausted assassin. James Bond went to seed, with too tight and garish clothes, gold chains and an ugly haircut. Our murderer in trouble, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, recovering strength. Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), a lucky businessman, is also looking for balance, but stays in the same hotel. Danny is desperate to make a deal and find his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright unexpectedly become friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques, which he demonstrates during a bullfight. Noble is finally targeted by his employers and shows up in Denver. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter and director Richard Shepard held the question-and-answer session after this charming film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also on his luck. After losing his agent and rejecting recent scripts, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a character that no one would want to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains his balance in this film. (There's a life after Bond!) He has a wonderful flair for self-disparaging comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay in the closing credits to read what filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to other plans from Richard Shepard.
