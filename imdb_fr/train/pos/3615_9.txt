I did not expect the powerful cinematic experience of "Girlfight". It's an indie; low budget, no known actors, first-year director. I had heard that it was good, but not so good. <br /> <br /> Located in a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job capturing the daily struggles of Latinos. Diana, the protagonist, boils with anger and blames her high school classmates, having problems with the school and her friends. She is raised by her unmarried father, who seems to love her and her brother, but applies a strict double standard, based on sex, to her children. The double standard of the father is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied any similar activity. Going to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny does not like boxing, so Diana and he exchange their places; He gets Daddy's money and gives it to Diana to take the lessons for him. <br /> <br /> It's actually a good movie, as Diana grows up and gets to know each other through boxing, meets a guy, and tackles very serious issues head-on. There is no laughter, 'everything that can go well is fine' resolution to the "Bend It Like Beckham". The reality and the personal problems associated with it are too important to solve the problem, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying film.
