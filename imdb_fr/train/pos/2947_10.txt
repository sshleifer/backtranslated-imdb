If you have not seen this, you do not know what you are missing. The first time you do it, you'll literally hurt badly, throw up with so much laughter, and probably get wet. <br /> <br /> It's so funny. To date, there has not been a single comic performance that exceeds or even approaches it. So many classics a liners, stories and segways .. <br /> <br /> Barbecued Uncle, Gi Joe, Mr T, Goony Goo Goo, Ice Cream Man, you say anything about these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I bet you dollars in donuts, they will not be able to keep their face clean and will burst out laughing, or recite the rest of the dialogue of the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! Too bad you can not get it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
