Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com film database. After seeing this film, you may think that Duvall's appearance is the best of reincarnation. One of my most favorite movies. I would like the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick, to have a CD or soundtrack available. Wonderful and "too likely" landscapes and music, especially for those of us who live in the South or have settled in this country. It's a "real moment in time". Life moves slowly, but "strangers do not stay".
