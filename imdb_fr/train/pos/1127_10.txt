I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but I've been haunted ever since. <br /> <br /> A sequence remains particularly in the mind and could only be shaped by a great director, as was probably Michael Cacoyanis. <br /> <br /> The context: the weight of history and a powerful army and fleet all rest on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. An act of sacrilege stalled the seas, endangering his great expedition to Troy. It is said that he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Apollo in order to win the wind for the sails of the Thousand Ships. He resists at first, but comes, and deceives his wife, Clytemenstra, to take their daughter to the Greek camp to marry the greatest warrior, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, discover the sacrifice, and rage to the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used fraudulently and dishonorably. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> The shooting: the camera surrounds the two young people without looking at each other. They deplore their fate and the weakness of men who deceive their loved ones and desire war. Suddenly, they look at each other and, for a moment, we feel both their strength and their beauty, as well as the undeclared - except by the camera - irony that at another time, in another place, they might maybe love each other and get married. . It is an acute and sad epiphany that lasts only a moment. <br /> <br /> Which direction! Which camera! What narration!
