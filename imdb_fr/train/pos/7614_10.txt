I am obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I love it. I'm on season 2, disc 5, and I tell you I'm too attached to the characters now. If something bad happened to them, it would seriously affect my vote for the show. And Michael is on my list now. Kidding ... I'm so happy to see that there's Season 3, because I was too scared to go to disc 6 thinking it was going to end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors / producers / and actors of Lost ... I like watching TV again. Before Lost, I surfed every channel while lying sad because of my disappointment on television, but I must say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
