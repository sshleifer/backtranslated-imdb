What can I say about this movie? I have seen it many times since the first time when I was about 6 years old. I saw the English version and it is very well done. It's a great movie for all ages, but it's more for children. I like childish humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
