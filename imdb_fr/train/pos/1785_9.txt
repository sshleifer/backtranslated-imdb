If you can not enjoy a movie of chicks, stop now. However, if you like movies that portray complex characters and offer an extraordinary game, keep reading. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord is dying. His two daughters arrive at his bedside. Ann begins talking about people from her past whose girls are not conscious and wonder if this lost knowledge is real or imagined. They come to realize that these people from their mother's past are real. <br /> <br /> The story changes, essentially, between 1953 and about 2000, with some glimpses of Ann's life between those years. It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of his life and experienced the greatest tragedy of his life. <br /> <br /> One of Ann's two best friends at university, Lila, is getting married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer living in Greenwich Village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of these 1950s conventions. > <br /> Soon after. Ann arrives to be the bridesmaid of Lila's wedding. She meets the person who will become the central figure in the life of the three - Harris. He is the adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Lila and Buddy and became a doctor in a small town in New England. Ann immediately becomes in love with Harris, which adds a complication to the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris and continues to be. Buddy, too, is in love with Harris, but in 1953 he redirected Harris's homosexual desire to his good friend Ann because he can not admit to himself that he has a sexual desire for another man. . Buddy shows his inner frustration by being the bad and alcoholic bad boy of the family - to the chagrin of his very good and tense parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all these feelings are expressed and repressed. emotions lead to tragedy - after all, it's a girls' movie. <br /> <br /> Currently, Ann's daughters have become distant from their mothers and suffer from their own achievements and doubts. Constance works at emotional exhaustion trying to keep her role as a perfect mother and wife. Nina, who has always felt inferior, can not have a relationship. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships for 50 years to get an intriguing look at the company, its values ​​and its effects on personalities. and the actions of the complex people involved. <br /> <br /> All Evening actors are excellent, but there are extraordinary performances and scenes - as well as two unique family relationships - that make this film so special. . <br /> <br /> Claire Danes embodies Ann in the 1950s, and she does so in a style that clearly shows a smart woman of that era who is in conflict with what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do. . We can not easily forget his performance. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann whose spirit goes from present to past and turns into fantasy flights. Redgrave, of course, gets away with his art. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter, Constance, in the movie. The scenes between this real life and her daughter playing fictitious roles between mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays Ann's other girl, Nina. Nina spends much of her time being depressed and self-pitying while excluding a good man who loves her, as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a role like this, but I have never seen her perform as badly as she does, no matter what role she plays. <br /> <br /> Granny Gummer plays Lila from the 1950s and shows us an even more confrontational woman from her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays today with Lila. What is there to say about Meryl Streep if she does not always give an insightful and rewarding performance? <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai says in the DVD supplements that he looked for Glenn Close to play the relatively small role of Lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress to whom he could think of playing a scene from the movie. He was certainly right, and Close's performance in that scene etched it in his mind. All the other scenes in which Close is Lila's real mother, and you get another show to cherish. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the movie, combined with the one featuring Close, described above, that make whole movie worth watching. On Lila's wedding day, Ann enters her room and goes to bed with her friend to discuss Lila's wrongs about her upcoming marriage to a man she obviously does not like. This scene is repeated fifty years later, when Lila arrives and goes to bed with her friend Ann dying to talk about the life they have lived. In this last scene, Streep and Redgrave are captivating. <br /> <br /> The other memorable scene - at least for me - is where Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking portrayal of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is superior. <br /> <br /> Chick Flick? Yes. A very special film with actors, directors and incredible sets? Absolutely. I can not recommend Evening too much.
