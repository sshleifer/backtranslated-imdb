Despite its budget limitations, this is an excellent film, proof that efforts and imagination can overcome the lack of money. The opening, in which rock paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs have at least survived until the age of man, is a pretty red herring. After that, a meteor descends into a lake and causes a heat that, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps rock paintings suggest that this is not the first time such a thing happens). When the prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-animated Plesiosaur that soon causes disappearances in the region. Okay, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still an authentic entertainment for movie fans.
