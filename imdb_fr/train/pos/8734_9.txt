The movie was totally awesome and cool. The graphics were superb and incredible. Above all, Flik was awesome and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was smart. The bugs of the circus are colorful and they are beautiful in the film. Grasshoppers were also beautiful and cool in the movie. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute. When, the bird comes to eat the insects, this scene was superb and good. Even the last scene was great and cool. Even Flik's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare grasshoppers. When ants build the artificial bird, the scene was good and pleasant. I would really appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
