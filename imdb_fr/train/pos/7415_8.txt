How powerful and captivating film simple quality can be. This film tells its story with everyday scenes that reveal the poignant intensity it hides. It's true, as others have stated, how clearly this film shows how Hollywood is lost in its special effects, excessive emotional and climatic extremes, and has forgotten the essence of a story. meaningful telling with simple realism. Much of what these characters are experiencing is implied by the scene rather than in a verbose dialogue. One of the things I really enjoyed in the film is the contrast between the two brothers, one very openly expressive in its childish way and the other completely stoic but capable of evoking a deep emotion. The elder brother needed to say little, as he usually did, everything was there in his impassive face! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful actor, good direction! Do not miss!
