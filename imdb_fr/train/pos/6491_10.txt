World At War is perhaps the biggest documentary series of all time. Historical research is virtually flawless. Even after a quarter century, it is the most accurate and definitive documentary on the Second World War. An inestimable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures of the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
