Great movie when I saw it. I must say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw him 8 times at the theater and I got the DVD. As I got older and saw him again, I realized that the film was average. Compared to movies known in good comedies, it's nothing. I mean, Rock was hilarious in the movie and all this tipping with the racial breaks a bit of the barriers, which is great. Also, the thought of how the film is going is a good way of thinking. It's like most people who think of a movie but also a touch very nice. I like the film overall so I give it a ... <br /> <br /> Another good 7/10 for me.
