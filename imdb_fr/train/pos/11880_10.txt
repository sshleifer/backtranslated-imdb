"Scarface" has a major cult even now, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> He has also been widely criticized for his excellent reputation, his lack of refinement, his refinement and his total swelling! These are people who compare Scarface to the Godfather's movies. It is true that on a technical level (cinematography, screenplay, production, etc.), Scarface is far behind "The Godfather". <br /> <br /> But it is also true that what Scarface has and another gangster lack of movies is brutality, the brutal approach of gangsters. The Latin American gangsters of this film look much more menacing and real than any of the refined Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like "The Godfather" or "Goodfellas". This is one of the main winning points of Scarface and I firmly believe that this fact has been described as "sticky" by most critics! I saw the original Scarface of 1932, and I must say that these two films are too different from each other and should be seen as two different films instead of praising the original for its "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for being too strong and too strong in this film. But why not consider that this is precisely what the filmmakers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who makes hasty decisions and stings tantrums every two minutes! He's not calm Michael Corleone here. This is Tony Montana, a very uneducated and uneducated individual who does not really think much and who gets angry all the time! <br /> <br /> The film really looks very lively. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some songs, like "The theme of Gina and Elvira", "Push it to the limit" and the track instrumental track. <br /> <br /> There are memorable and beautifully realized sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, Rebenga's hit, the first encounter with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother's house. <br /> <br /> About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as an angry Cuban refugee. He reportedly mentioned having enjoyed playing Tony Montana most of his career. And it really seems that he had fun in all his scenes! One wonders what "Scarface" would look like without Pacino. I could not imagine anyone else representing Tony Montana and, in all likelihood, the movie would not be as effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines like Tony's friend, Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. The same goes for F. Murray Abraham (as Omar). <br /> <br /> Then there is a treat for the eyes in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and fits in her role. <br /> <br /> The director goes a bit too far in a particular part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that it is the only small part that suffers because of mishandling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and awesome movies to date. outside. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrait of the Drug Lords and their gangland!
