BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This is an offbeat movie featuring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play the role of two idle friends who create a sport in their driveway, which will then feel. Most gags are really hilarious, but the funny part of the movie is when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One of the flaws in this film is that the pace is much too fast, and after half an hour of watching, I found myself asking "Wow, is that already?" Another hilarious part of the movie was the way Joe and Doug continually harass Squeak, a very excited little guy. BASEketball is a comedy classic with very popular lines, and it's a lot of fun to watch!
