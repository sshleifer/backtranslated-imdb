Raising Victor Vargas is a film that you absolutely must see. It was a feeling of heart and a lot of humor that yearned you. It looks so much like real life with what teens have to live. Victor, an arrogant teenager, but with a good heart at the end, deals with love in all good places with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old-fashioned grandmother and a girl he wants to use uses it too. I recommend people watch this movie because it will be like watching a real family. That's all the film feels. A great moment was felt when Victor's grandmother threw the winner on something simple. Victor really had a heart and could not believe she would do something like that. It made me feel really sorry for him as if it were real. Overall, I give a B + to this film
