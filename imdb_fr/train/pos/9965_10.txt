Perfect for families with young children who are looking for light, violence-free, kid-friendly and fun movies, albeit completely tacky, for adults. This is not a bad movie for a low budget job. The children will be amazed by Santa's workshop and by the "magic" that allows him to enter the houses by chimneys too small or without houses at all! <br /> <br /> Children will be thrilled by Santa's success in thwarting the evil devil named Pitch (complete in the classic red suit with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl whose greatest wish is to have a little doll to love. And the poor little rich boy who only wants to spend time with his parents always absent. And what child does not know in school of people who are like the bad boys enlisted by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas? In the end, everyone, including the bad boys, will get what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The film will please children, both Santa Claus and the message of love he conveys to people around the world. <Br /> <br />
