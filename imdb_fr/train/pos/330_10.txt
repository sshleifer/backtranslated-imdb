I'm Italian and when I recently saw this movie, I was amazed by its beauty: the first time, I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with the spirit and the feelings of an adult. I can now understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), gone by then. <br /> <br /> Epic Hollywood movies are good ... for fun. Maybe this "Odyssey" did not have an English version because it's not funny enough ... not suitable for popcorn and coke viewers. However appropriate for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections. <br /> <br /> In Italy has just released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file shares, but only in Italian and without subtitles. Too bad: the dialogues and voices of this film are remarkable.
