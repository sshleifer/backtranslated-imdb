I really enjoyed this film. I thought the movie's plot was realistic and relevant at any point in American history. There is always this woman doing what she has to do to climb the ladder of the class system. I think Lilly's character was described correctly and could not be improved. What I liked most was when she realized what love really was. Throughout the film, all the men who fell in love with her were in love with her, gave her everything, or even lost their career. Before meeting Cortland, she did not understand why these men had left everything for happiness. The end of her life was far from what she expected. I would recommend this film to all mature viewers so you can understand the content and the underlying meaning of the film and the plot.
