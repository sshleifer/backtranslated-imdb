This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had several friends over the course of one night and, for one reason or another, we surfed the channel to HBO during the evening. Someone named "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried not to laugh too loud at the first jokes. I did not want to be held "responsible" for the enjoyment by the rest of the group of something that was obviously killing me. After holding back my laughter for more than my health, I let go - as did the rest of us (we were not stoned, besides, we did not talk about insurance or pensions ...). We were asphyxiated afterwards. The story, the intrigue, the strange but ingenious links that mark the sketches are no less brilliant. Since then, I'm addicted to all of Eddie-Izzard's comedies that I can get my hands on. His work is pure genius. His comedy seems effortless. He's more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and talking about this or that ... It's really convulsive. It gives you the impression that the joke is between you ... and himself, the only true aficionados of humor, after all. If you are disappointed with this video, you have no sense of penultimate humor - or humor, as they say in the UK.
