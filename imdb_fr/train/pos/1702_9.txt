If you have trouble dreaming, you can give a low note to this movie. But you just have to realize that this movie was not designed to please everyone, but only to comedians. <br /> <br /> For these people, the movie is great! He plays in old sci-fi movies and long-gone radio shows, most witches where B-rated themselves. Like Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination to understand the jokes, but it's worth it.
