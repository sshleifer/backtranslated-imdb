Clint Eastwood has certainly produced better films than this one, but this one does not bother him. Dirty Harry catches everyone's attention and unless you want to watch a romance, there's no reason you do not like it. He's cool because he's dirty, he's great because he kills without thinking, it's perfect because he has the ball in his heart and a hero because he does not care. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen in the movies Eastwood plays, the main character still captivates the audience. In White Hunter Black heart, he is the crazy director, in "in the line of fire", he is the "old" whereas here is the "almost" unemployed, that is to say that he works for him Even makes fun of his superiors who send him practically on vacation. <br /> <br /> This film, based on a rape victim, is promising for all "meaningless" viewers. The film has nothing that moves away from the central plot. However, what makes it slightly inferior to Eastwood's best films is that, even though the main character plays a captivating role, the plot is not, because it's far too obvious from the beginning. It's not a film that will make you sit still. In addition, there are too many people much dirtier than Dirty Harry.
