It's a good movie. I think some people think that it might not be based on a true story. Anyways !!, the movie is awesome, and all you can think of is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying into the city of mermaids and so on, thinking rather than "The wish of a little girl has come true", and that means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in ourselves and do everything in this world to make them come true. The little girl (Desi - in the film) and her mother were the best actors I've seen in a long time. Good for them, for all actors, all for the director. If anyone can tell them that, please tell them: "A 25-year-old Romanian says thank you for making this film".
