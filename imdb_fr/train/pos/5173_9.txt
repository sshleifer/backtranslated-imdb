I rarely see a film with which I am totally absorbed; it was one of them. There were good actors, dialogues, intrigues and the scenery was beautiful. I had a lot of laughs, especially the scene of the raid in the kitchen. The slapstick comedy performed by the rented lunkhead hand threw me one on the floor, but I admit that I am a sucker for slapstick. The story concerned a group of people in their thirties who were returning to a holiday camp they had attended 20 years earlier. It was a week of goodbye camping, because the place would be closed permanently at the end of the season. As adults, the camp looked different and they felt different from each other. I recommend this funny and moving movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
