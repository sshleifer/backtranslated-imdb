David Burton (Richard Chamberlain, very good) is a lawyer, better able to manage corporate taxation (and who suffers from unusual dreams that make it difficult to see this Aboriginal person plunged into darkness), who is called to take a case about a group of aboriginals accused of murdering one of their own, Billy ... we see that he is trying to steal stones adorned with ritual paintings and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named Charlie uses a "bone dead "stop his heart. Meanwhile, circling David, bizarre meteorological phenomena affect Sydney, such as the rain that strikes rocky dirt and hail under a bright blue sky (no cloud, like the one that hits a school in central Australia ), without forgetting, a "deformed" rainbow divided into groups (!). As David continues the case, he realizes that he is much closer to the strange events that unfold than he would ever have realized. An aboriginal named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears to him in a dream holding a stained stone and he discovers that this man is one of those he must represent at the trial! After some strange encounters with Charlie and conversations with Chris, it's quite possible that he's most likely linked to a spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are real premonitions of possible horrors. <br /> <br /> The absorbing apocalyptic drama builds its story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. Under the direction of Peter Weir, the film is visually striking when we see these overwhelming images of a possible ruin towards civilization, but the most fascinating angle of the film is certainly David's journey to find this monumental truth that torments him as he questions Charlie and Chris tirelessly, first to help his men get out of a crime they did not commit and finally to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic or which could happen later.
