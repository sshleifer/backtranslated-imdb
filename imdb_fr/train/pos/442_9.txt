This is what I call a growth film. Each character is different and better in the end - and that's because a woman knows that the place she has chosen is a "bath of love". Josie Lawrence, who is better known as an actress, really shines like the woman behind all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being egocentric to better men. The book remained very faithful to the novel, which is an advantage in my book, since I am a librarian. The breathtaking landscape and the message of genuine love.
