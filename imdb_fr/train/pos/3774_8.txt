After the brilliant adventure of Bill and Ted, Bill and Ted are threatened by the future, while the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted, to kill the human Bill and Ted, to change the future. <br /> <br /> In an excellent pair of comedies, Winter and Reeves excel at providing delightful public humor in this fun sequel. Although lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey retains the great slogans and dialogues of the leaders, not to mention the hilarious performance of William Sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the mower. Watch the game sequences, the best moment of the entire movie, but one of the many great techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> This film, although full of humor, has a more dramatic film, with more serious issues and riskier situations. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a great dimension and another lovely feature. The creators have also pushed the limits of fantasy and realism, hell and paradise being highly symbolic and present in the plot. The fantastic genre is once again perfectly used with the use of this amazing time machine, although again, it is somewhat confusing with the use of timing, and that objects and situations are placed before that happens in the present, as shown in the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The first shows that I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy, because I enjoyed more jokes and history, and even though the jokes and the plot are not as powerful as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough good motivations, jokes and a fairly stable plot to make it a family film in a good mood.
