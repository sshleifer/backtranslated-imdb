For all those who are waiting for a traditional superhero movie, this could be a nasty surprise. It's more of a drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and looks a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character, there is always a problem. <br /> <br /> It's because Sasha, like every superhero, does right society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes an outlaw. When he runs away, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, things get even more complicated. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the film lacks momentum. It reminds me a bit of the story of Ram Gopal Varma's recent films. Everything is going very slowly. However, when there is an action scene, it becomes so dynamic that before realizing what is happening, everything is over. But the director does not want to impress us with showy and showy actions. What is more important here is the result of Sasha's actions, which are for the most part very drastic. The score is very rare, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. You must be very patient to be able to look at it. <br /> <br /> Is the film worth it? This is a very difficult question to answer. I do not think this experience has enriched me so much, but I still think about this movie and I want to see it again. Mainly because of the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because Sasha and Katya have all the time of hope. After all, they are young people who have all their lives to live. So, no matter how difficult, there is always a slight merry air when they are together.
