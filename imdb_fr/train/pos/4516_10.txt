Since Rita's education, Julie Walters is one of my models and her performance as a woman who helps the man she loves to synchronize with her feminine side is magnificent. I never thought her character was in the hands of a lesser actress, but Walters did it with panache and brilliance. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance so far in men.
