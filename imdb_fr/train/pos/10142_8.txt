Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical affairs, but this one has made my skin run (forgive the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go beyond and as satisfying as it comes in terms of revenge movies. Not only did I feel a lot of hatred for the negro and a lot of sympathy for the "na√Øve", but I felt myself cringe and feel a sense of disgust at times, which is really a rare and delightful thing for a horror viewer a little jaded as myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but are considered a tribute rather than an imitation. It's a heavy hand piece that does not offer much to the viewer, but I like to be hit by a movie from time to time. This piece brings and does not excuse. I really liked this one. DO NOT look while eating pudding.
