I do not remember having seen this one before tonight, probably that the title seemed so ordinary that it kept doubling me. But it's a well-designed western western, with an interesting story to watch complimented from good to old. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum goes down to a big open city looking for his wife and the news of their daughter, and remains a time as a city tamer. As usual, business people have mixed feelings - they want to get rid of the bad guys, but they like the things they bring. This still applies: relax the laws on beverages and gambling and encourage industries, but claim to deplore the detrimental effects it can have on ordinary people. What is fascinating in this film is the cynical incarnation of Mitchum in the cleansing of the city of the wicked, and the acceptance by the townspeople that his violent methods were the only ones. Favorite track: the sudden disappearance of 2 bad guys in the Red Dog Lounge. The firing of the main hall grazed the evil, but it was an effective way to fight the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very good movie with its only flaw that tends to be a little spicy - less good for benefactors who would probably prefer a life of negotiation with Evil rather than end it.
