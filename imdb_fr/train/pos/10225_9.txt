I had a good laugh reading all the silly comments from this movie, <br /> <br /> because it's obvious that those who criticized the movie never saw it or were stupid enough to pay for it. see. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch was the Elvira show a few years ago. Elvira delivered the film with as much laughter as possible. <br /> <br /> It's a decent monster movie, compared to hundreds of dreadful American movies. Much better!!!!
