First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and that other people say it, then it is the chaos of the pilot that exceeds me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical form of Sarah Silverman, perhaps not directly funny, but the situation and delivery are what matters. <br /> <br /> If you love Jesus, it's magic so I do not see how you would like. Not like that. It has the same flow and the same rhythm. That's right, it's only for real fans, but if you are you'll be happy. <br /> <br /> Again, only for real fans, it's impossible. If you are not used to his style, you will not understand why it's funny. However, this is the case, and I hope you think so too.
