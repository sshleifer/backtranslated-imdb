"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful love story and must be part of my favorite Top 5 movie. Dialogue and play are great. I like characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Vienna presented in the film does not exist (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to visit all places in one place. night, either (especially if you are a stranger and this is your first night in Vienna). But this is not the question. The relationship between the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Although nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. The end is really sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I am a bit skeptical about what will be published this summer. The first part is perfect in my opinion.
