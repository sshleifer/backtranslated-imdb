"Old Mill Pond" by Harman and Isings is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. The consummate skill and artistic talent that characterize this duet work are nowhere more evident than in this caricature. It is unfortunate that so many people see only one crime in what is, and has always been, a light entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate blacks. On the contrary, it is a tribute to the contagious humor and musicality of the black race. I have not been able to consider this confection for many years, because the "race commissioners" in England have judged it too offensive to be shown in multi-racial Britain. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, I would love to see this masterpiece again. I think those who systematically look for messages and intentions that have never been foreseen in these cartoons, which are still sixty years old, should try to lighten and remember that the world is very different from today. but that does not mean that anyone has the right to censor what is visible from the past.
