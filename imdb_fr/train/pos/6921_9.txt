Remember, I'm a fan of the genre, but I only recently saw this film for the first time. The way I neglected all this time is a marvel for me. For me, it's a better film than the very famous "High Noon". It's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is in black and white with an exceptional cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart, this movie is not to be missed.
