If you are a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise, hold your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr version - I've seen it dozens of times, but this movie is just as good, but different. I will not detail the differences because it would spoil the film. It's also a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a big fan of Indiana Jones), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain and the support cast is superb. I find that the quality of the secondary distribution is one of Hallmark Production's hallmarks and that this film was no exception. The cinematography is beautiful and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
