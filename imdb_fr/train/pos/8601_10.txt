My observations: the final vamp outfit is lovely and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well and got the better of na√Øve Nelson. A boat broke on his balcony served him well. The costumes of her female mafia were designed in a surprising way, especially compared to current standards. The costume designer of 1942 did a great job. The theme of the main song is simply charming. <br /> <br /> Warning regarding negative posters: 1942 was the time of the Second World War; Pearl Harbor arrived the year before. The United States has just come out of the Great Depression; need to go out and spend this hard earned money for entertainment, singing, dancing and, yes, fantastic fantasy. Despotic dictators were trying to pronounce themselves in RL, stifling freedoms. Thank God, the audience had these fantastic movies on the plot. Going to the cinema was a privileged pleasure, in these depressing times. When you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, you then have the opportunity to talk and criticize. Jeanette and Nelson's films stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel's wings are beautiful, on the real angel. The wings of RL at the costume party are not very hot, but it's good for Jeanette, given the SL. <br /> <br /> Nice song of Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette dancing was a pure delight. <br /> <br /> 15/10
