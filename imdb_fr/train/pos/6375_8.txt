Although I have a great respect for Disney's animated films, lately they are not really what I would call "to see". Atlantis seemed intriguing from the very first movie poster and trailer, and fortunately, met my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney movie in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for Disney), and focuses more on action and discovery than any other recent offer of Disney. The world of Atlantis, hidden in the heart of the Earth, is fantastic. It appears as desolate caves with ruins, then slowly develops into true ecosystems that, while usually containing some traces of hardness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself becomes attained. . The presentation of the landscape and the frame of Atlantis, without a few juicy, expendable songs, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to link it to the mythology of ancient civilizations of real life, add to this and work quite well. <br /> <br /> In addition, with the exception of some scenes starring Mole's jokes, there does not seem to be a "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the fight to get to Atlantis and the constant discovery that was happening at Atlantis, because Milo, the stranger, was able to learn everything he ever needed to know about this place helping Atlanteans to discover parts of their own story that they did not know. Part of this concerns the Atlantean "weapons", which are used in a very charged climax which is, for want of a better word, quite exciting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole story does not lead to meaning, and the film does not present new computer-generated stunning visual effects, but, apart from the Toy Story films, it is the film Disney's most entertaining I've seen in years.
