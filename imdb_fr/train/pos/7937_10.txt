I thought the movie "I Do They Do not" was fantastic. In the past, I saw Rob Estes in "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" as well as Josie Bissett in "Melrose Place" and I loved seeing them together in "I Do They Do not". They have good chemistry together (I guess getting married in real life helps that!) - in the movie they are widowed with kids and have a career. They fall in love and try to mix their chaotic families already busy without losing sight of. Of course, they stumble, but they stay the course, that's what working and raising a family is all about. So many people have talked about this movie - everything is fine! - and the movie left us wanting more. That would make a big series - appealing to several ages! - it would be so nice to see real life, down to earth, a family show like this that describes the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so-called "reality TV" that all stations overwhelm us with these days. Someone tells ABC Family members that they have the start of a new series here!
