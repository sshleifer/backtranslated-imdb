I just watched this recently on Sundance. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers, famous in their own country, to make short films, including eleven, all gathered in a single film, focusing on a single topic: September 11. <br /> <br /> From wacthing this movie, I could tell why these filmmakers were so good in their country because it had all the elements of a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an Iranian film in which a teacher has trouble teaching students what happened with 9/11 and they do not realize later. <br /> <br /> The second film from France features a deaf woman who writes a letter to her lover while she does not know anything about what is happening on television. play. <br /> <br /> The next film from Egypt involves the filmmaker himself speaking with a soldier who died of recent events, not only of the terrorists of September 11, but also of bombings perpetrated by other places. <br /> <br /> Then comes Bolivia, where a girl learns the events of September 11 and believes she must walk for her. <br /> <br /> The next from a country in Africa where a group of boys follows a man they think is Ben Ladin. <br /> <br /> The next comes from Mexico, in which nothing is seen except the sounds of this day. <br /> <br /> The next Israeli film involving a journalist at the scene of a bomb seeking a report, but who is frequently informed about the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies that I can 'Remember for the moment but they are all powerful. This will bring back your emotions from this day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
