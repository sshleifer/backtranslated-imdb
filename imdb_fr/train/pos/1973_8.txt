I never trust anyone's opinions about a movie. This also applies to critics. Of course, if it receives positive reviews, it's good and an advantage, but most critical movies praise me that I hate. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an entertaining film. It takes you out of your life for a few hours and puts you in a fictional character ... that is Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is great in this role, just as she was in the first. Anyone who claims to be horrible in this film must have felt the same way in the first movie, because she is back like she did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays it to perfection. His one liners are excellent, a bit like in the first. Who can forget in the first movie when she says to the cops: "If you want to stop me, do it ... if not get the f ** k out of here!" Beautiful scene, and believe me, she still does it in this one. She captivated me. Her outfits, the way she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, it's worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I can not wait for this film to be released on DVD, not cut, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are a lot of twists, as in the first, including the end!
