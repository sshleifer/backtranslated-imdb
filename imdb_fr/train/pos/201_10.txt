The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her works in this silent comedy of the end (1928) which also features the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a good shot of Georgia who crushes Hollywood with the help of Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great drama star. A thunder on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (a pity they never did a walkie talkie together) and their guests include Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies (see absolutely). that) are funny. A must for any serious moviegoer or anyone interested in Marion Davies, always criticized!
