The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his artistic project is to unmask the ridiculous culture in which we bathe. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood blockbuster movies and touches many other media. Finally, he finds himself in the field of the weapon he set in motion. The film is five years old and rings every day more true. This is the best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's also one of my favorite 10 movies.
