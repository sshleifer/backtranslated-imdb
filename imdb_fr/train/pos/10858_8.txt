Enjoyed the film and effective crime drama Confucian, the old order survives the threat posed by a rash young greedy man, probably representing modern society. I thought the final scene was strange and I could not understand if we had to believe that Big D was punished for being too greedy or that it was a long time part of the plan. I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts festival. What always amuses me about Hong Kong films is that the main influence of the British seems to be to introduce "yes sir" and "sorry" into the local language. It's funny that they are always here long after we leave.
