"House Of Games" is not without flaws - holes, intrigue, final scenes - but they do not disturb the pleasure of watching a thriller that bother you methodically. "House Of Games" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. Of course, this is no small feat considering that we deal with the world of men of trust and their disadvantages. It goes without saying that we never really know what is going on, even though we think we are doing it. But that's what makes the movie interesting for those who play. a film for which repeated viewing is indulgences instead if it proves necessary. <br /> <br /> It has a defined inclination of Hitchcock.

One could easily imagine that the character of Lindsay Crouse is identical to that of Tippi Hedrin ... ten years later perhaps. Both are solitary solitaries, both with compulsive behaviors that force them to walk too close to the shark pool. As the repressed character of Crouse puts it: "What is life without adventure?" Set your reality on a low setting and enjoy swimming with sharks!
