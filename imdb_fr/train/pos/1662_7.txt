Artemisia's film can be considered a betrayal or a true artistic license. <br /> <br /> What could we say on average? <br /> <br /> In a documented story, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to knurled screw and always claimed she was hurt, as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem eloquently asserted. <br /> <br /> In the film, under a different torture, she refused to condemn her lover / violator. <br /> <br /> How can a film deviate so much from the history received, yet still inform the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not so difficult to find. In the film, the director and the actors had filled the historical blank of the historical record with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This led to a conclusion different from that of the disc. <br /> <br /> So be it. I think the record and the movie are convincing. <br /> <br /> Both in the film and (it seems) in the story, Artemisia was above all a painter. <br /> <br /> For this vision, framed in a ravishing movie composition, I'm really grateful. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a film that made me look so bad. <br /> David Broadhurst
