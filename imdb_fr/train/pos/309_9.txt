Before watching this TV movie, I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After watching it, I realized how sad Lucille Ball's life was. There were good times too, but I did not realize how sad it was. This film was very good and tells very well the story of the beloved Lucille Ball. I highly recommend it.
