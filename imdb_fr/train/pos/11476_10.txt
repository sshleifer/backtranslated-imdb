Day zero is based on the Colombian high school massacre. and it's a video diary of two boys. At first, you do not know what will happen, you think it's a bad student movie. until they start talking about the horrible things they will do in this school enough. until they start talking about pipe-bombs and guns and shooting in the woods. it's a lot to say about this movie. all know that this film is a film that you forget to watch a movie and watch a real video made by two boys. <br /> <br /> the two boys act as if they were in a strange cult. they burn all these things. like play station games books dvds homework school stuff. these two boys can be anyone, your friends, your brothers or the people you see walking down the street. that goes through their daily activities (and that's a gunshot.) In the videos that are presented there is mention of the intimidation that is inflicted on them and the way people talk about their clothes and people are doing things like that. <br /> <br /> And we suspect that people appreciate it because of the sensitive subject they chose in this film. <br /> <br /> my comment on the day zero. <br /> <br /> and let's just say that the scene of the end of the shooting is ruined.
