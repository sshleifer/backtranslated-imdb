Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / cooler film from 1990, released here in the UK under the label "New World Video". <br /> <br /> This is a desert-based horror movie about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend, only to be killed one by one by force unknown driving a black truck threatening !!! This movie has scary scenes, and some gore here and there, but I must say that the acting was so bad, even with a reduced budget! But the movie was strangely addictive and I liked it, and I never fell asleep or went out, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but considering its rise throughout the course, I had good moments of gore and suspense, good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the lead role was also a hottie! I will give it 7/10.
