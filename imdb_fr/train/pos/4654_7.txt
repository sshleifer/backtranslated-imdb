It's a money-grabber, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates a British company, Texa-Conn or something, posing as a computer and security expert. He secretly learns to hack into the computer, while garnering the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the enmity of his rival in the office, Bob Newhart, and the love of his incompetent secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some The commercial details were a little fuzzy for those nonprofessional eyes, but they were pretty believable and the general idea was given to me. Ustinov, the sinner Peter, creates fake companies in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart and uses Texa-Conn's computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz. Foreign companies, of course, are nothing more than himself, Ustinov, and the addresses are an abandoned artist loft in Paris, a hairdresser in Rome and a bakery in Germany. He just visits them to collect the checks he sent himself. <br /> <br /> I did not think that I would like the first minutes because it seemed rather slow. I was expecting something with a faster and more indignant tempo, like "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Hill Gang". But this film creeps into your good graces as you come to appreciate the sober humor of the plot, characterizations and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It would probably be a bad idea to give too many relatively subtle gags, but here are some of the most remarkable examples. <br /> <br /> Ustinov to Secretary Smith: "Let me have the assets of these companies." Smith: "What are the assets?" Ustinov: "Little donkeys." Now nothing is done about this little exchange. There is a quick break and no delay for a laugh, which is appropriate because his reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov is looking for this shabby loft in Paris. It is covered with spider webs. Bricks are scattered and some paintings of the former occupant have been left behind. The owner does not speak English and Ustinov does not speak French. Ustinov points to a painting of a naked woman looking like a child and laughs, "Ah, a fam fye-tal, huh?" The owner also laughs and replies, "Are you making the decision for a year?" Ustinov: "Oh - ANNIE, that's his name!" Owner: "Yes?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (My friends, if I'm wrong, I'm sorry.) Bob Newhart in the role of Willard Gnatpole (!) Has a crush on Maggie Smith and is supposed to drive her home but tells him he's borrowing "the panoramic road ". There is an immediate sequence of suggestive signs. "Caution." "Parking area." "Give Way." "Yield." Finishing with the imperious "STOP / CHILDREN". There is another montage when the board of directors will discover Ustinov's project: blurred roofs, police cars, Maggie's farewell, ending with a sign: PRISON, Scrub Wormwood. <br /> <br /> maybe one more. I still can not convince Malden as boss, declaring decisively: "I'm never tortured for decisions", then swallow a handful of pills and wash them with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> without question well. This is the best role of Bob Newhart, for example. Not that he has had many, and that his reach is not limited, but he is perfect in this part. The musical score of Laurie Johnson had obviously made a lot of effort. She seems to have written a short concerto for flute. Ustinov's passion is music and his establishments abroad are run by fake names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. The false president of Stuttgart is called Schmidt and it is an abnormal clinker. Maggi Smith is pretty, sexy, bourgeois and proves to be not so stupid as she seems. <br /> <br /> Delightful, in its own way, but do not expect a comic firework.
