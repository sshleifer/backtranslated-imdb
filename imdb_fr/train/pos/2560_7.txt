Brando plays the role of pilot Asce Jet, who has just overthrown the MiG during the Korean War. On leave, he discovers his Madame Butterfly and falls in love with him. The two lovers see the madness of racism and the cruelty that conservative cultural norms can bring to human relationships. <br /> <br /> This film is an excellent romance with a beautiful twist that rejects the conservative, dominant racist norms it was made in 1957. "Sayonara" will make you laugh and cry. Be careful though, sometimes the background music will make you wish he was not there. However, the title song of Irving Berlin will delight your memory for a long time after your theater lights come back on.
