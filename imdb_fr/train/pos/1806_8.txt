I hope that children's films have been made that way; dark and deep. There was (get this) the development of the character (and Charlie is the very embodiment of the dynamic character), the development of the plot, a superb animation, an emotional implication and a rational theme, relatable and coherent. Without the handful of routines of songs and dances, you would never have thought it was a children's movie, and that's why I give it such a high score. This film is an excellent movie, let alone for a children's movie. Which brings me to my second point: it must be the darkest "children's" film I've seen in a while, this one from a 22-year-old man. I would be shocked to see a child under 8 not completely terrified during most of the last half and part of the first half of the movie, and all ends with one of the saddest endings you may encounter (ala "Jurassic Bark", for those of you who are fans of 'Futurama'), and that's what makes this movie so good. The fact that the film universally evokes emotions that we do not normally like to feel and assume to be bad does not make the film bad in itself; in fact, it means that it succeeded. Good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh; good horror movies are supposed to scare us; Good, sad movies are supposed to make us sad. What I mean is that good movies are supposed to move you, not just entertain; In addition, this film is incredibly violent compared to current standards for a children's film and contains a subject that, by today's standards, may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I would say look at it first. I'm not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing, but I just saw it yesterday and it was a surprise even for me.
