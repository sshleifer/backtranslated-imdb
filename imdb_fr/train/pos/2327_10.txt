A 14-year-old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17-year-old boy who lives nearby, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic film, directed by director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for having already directed Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the genre. Here he directs the newcomers in the lead roles: Reese Witherspoon, in his film debut, as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, as older sister; Jason London, in the role of Court, the 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good in her film debut, displaying all the emotions a 14-year-old girl feels when she experiences the love and pain of a young person, without ever hitting a wrong note. Warfield and London are also good. The film accurately describes each teenager's thoughts or feelings regarding love with sincere sensitivity, without ever falling into the excess of maudlin, even once. Congratulations to Jenny Wingfield's autobiographical scenario; This is one of the few films about young love that is honest and consistent, without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, emphasizing the tone and mood of one scene to another, but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is that of the famous horror director Freddie Francis, who was 70 years old when it was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston embody the parents of the girls with unflinching precision for 1957, attentive, strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to settle, lessons to learn and truths to face in this film with a sweet character that contains an emotional mass. To date, this is Robert Mulligan's latest film. This is one of the best movies of 1991. **** on 4 stars.
