How can a film featuring Curtis Mayfield's vocals be bad? It can not! The Groove Tube is a series of disguising skyscrapers that make fun of everything from 2001 to the Olympics. The ups, (Koko the clown, the easy lubricant recipe) are more numerous than the stockings (too long "The Dealers"), but even the stockings are funny. Best of all is Ken Shapiro's manic dance on a busy Manhattan sidewalk (it's Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me). Absolutely outdated now, but at the time, The Groove Tube was irreverent, bold, unscrupulous and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this cult hit minor, then 7 years later, Modern Problems (although I liked it), and since then, unfortunately, nothing (he could perhaps play drums in a jazz band) The Groove Tube remains for me an endless surge of positive energy, a film that, 26 years after my first viewing, always brings me a real joy!
