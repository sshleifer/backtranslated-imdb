This Oscar-winning short film can be one of the biggest of its kind. Completely without dialogue, it is a visual treat for a young boy who buys a gold fish, lovingly places it in a bowl and then goes to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open. After a while, a neighbor orange tabby comes to search, enters through the window and slowly goes to the bowl. Apparently, the fish knows something is happening and gets very excited. As the cat approaches the bowl, the fish jumps. The cat catches the fish, drops it in the bowl and goes out the window where it entered when the boy, not knowing what happened, comes back. It was incredibly filmed with real animals; how Cousteau got these animals to behave in this way is remarkable. I only wish this film is available now for people to see; I saw it only once, in 1959, when it was released, but it remains unforgettable.
