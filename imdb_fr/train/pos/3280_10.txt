I only saw this film once before, about ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and, after watching it, I think it's even better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is more than a horror. There was such a level of emotion and excellent characterization. I especially thought that Charlotte Burke was really excellent here. It's so bad she did not do anything else because she was an excellent actress. Her emotional portrait throughout the film was perfect, with just enough subtlety to get the message across, especially in the end when she realized that even though Marc had passed away, she knew he was going to go well. <br /> <br /> Several scenes made me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror movies), including the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the strange radio in the background and the piece where the legs broke and collapsed into dust. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an excellent and very moving film.
