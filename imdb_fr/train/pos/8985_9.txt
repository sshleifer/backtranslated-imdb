Although DiG! was hailed as being close to what the music industry is as if it were highly manufactured. The director misled the public into believing that the Brian Jonestown massacre had disappeared from the Earth's surface after 1998. And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown was exploited. The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie is endlessly endless and is an interesting watch when we watch two very talented bands of musicians creating their art. One of the best things this film aims for is a unique perspective between the independent music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended mainly for music and two fantastic bands.
