I remember this show that became a regular show on a Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is a girl who moves into her aunts. Sabrina must learn to control the powers of man and use them effectively. She must also take care of the school of a fierce rival named Libby, her best friend and boyfriend Harvey Kinkle ... <br /> <br /> The show was funny and entertaining. It entertained every Saturday night for a 10 year old boy ... and made him laugh ... and flirt with "Libby" ...
