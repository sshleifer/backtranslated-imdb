Pinjar is one of the few films that really leaves a mark and makes you think. Located in Partition India, this movie shows the true reality of the India score. Urmila got all the benefits for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrait of a suffering woman with no way out. His freedom, personal identity and family respect were taken away from him overnight as a result of a tragic land dispute. Manoj Bajpai is just brilliant as his delighted ravisher. There are several moments in the film where we are crying. The point film is deeply traumatic. Some of the score scenes are terrifying, but Urmila's stamina and survival are remarkable. From a woman deprived of her liberty to a woman who has given freedom to women in similar situations. A remarkable film that deserves the credit of intelligent characters and storytellers.
