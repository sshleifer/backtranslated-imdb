Gandhi, my father, is like looking at a book, chapter by chapter, you read it (with your eyes) and you learn more about Harilal Gandhi and, in this regard, Kasturba Gandhi. We know so little about them two and this film describes them in a unique way. The title however misleads, it is as much a film on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son as on Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Such films are like leap years. They come after so much time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father, also speaks of an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any struggle for freedom ever undertaken. <br /> <br /> Look at it, if you like quality cinema.
