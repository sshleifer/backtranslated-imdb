I just saw "Valentine" and I must say it was the best slasher movie I've seen in years. Unlike the recent trend of horror movies of the 90s, this movie is more about being strange than making fun of itself. For those who hated "Scream", there is no reference to "horror rules" in this movie (even if the old slasher movie rules apply here). <br /> <br /> It's the perfect mix of horror movies from the '80s and' 90s. You get the style, cinematography, and good acting of the '90s movies, as well as the movie's stalking-slasher craze I guess the year 2001 will finally give horror fans the kind of movies they longed for. This is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out here as a funny character. You can say that she loved her role and that it sets her apart from others. I loved him in this movie.
