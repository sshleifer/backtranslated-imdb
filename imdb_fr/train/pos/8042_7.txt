**** SPOILERS **** The movie "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of the legendary US Navy sniper Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. Mr. Rogers' unassuming look-alike, who has recorded nearly 300 dead and confirmed and unconfirmed by the Vietnamese and North Vietnamese army during his two tours to "Nam", shows just how sniper qualified military is deadly and effective <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a fresh and deadly clam as Sgt.Thomas Beckett who is at the end of his career as a US Navy sniper but who will later realize a life of useless civil. Since he has nothing to do except his skills he learned in the US Marines, unless he decides to become a hit-man mob. Backett reluctantly accepts his destiny as a professional killer for life in his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "Sniper" is centered on Sgt.Beckett with the help of former silver medalist and US government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, being sent to the deep in the Panamanian jungle. The two snipers must eliminate rebel general Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa, and the Colombian drug king, Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who supports him in the context of the military takeover. <br /> <br /> We see earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett is watching and getting out a rebel leader who, in my opinion, is the best sniper scene. Because it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his observer Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a sub-plot that was later abandoned in the film about a DeSilva rebel sniper, Eward Wiley, who was hounding Beckett and then killed Papich while they were both waiting to be killed. out of the jungle by a military helicopter. You might have thought that a dead cat and mouse were playing between the two, which would lead to the end of the movie but Sgt. Beckett had no trouble sending DeSilva at the beginning of the movie using a suspicious Miller as bait. <br /> <br /> What hurt the most the film was ironically the last fifteen minutes or so, when the story went from one shot to the next shot a sniper movie to kill Rambo-like ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fighting a whole battalion of rebels with bullets as heavy as a London fog. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is always worth watching, as it tells the story of a person who is no longer really glamorous: war movies are a lone killer who kills with precision and the skill of a diamond cutter or an accomplished neurosurgeon who does so in the greatest secrecy.
