Here is a movie that is really funny every moment it covers. How can we not say that this film stars the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? When I saw this film for the first time, I did not immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their acting and writing skills were pretty impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they were really Matt and Trey later. The humor is sometimes brutal, sometimes rude, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid, but overall, it's a hell movie that is undoubtedly, underestimated. In fact, it's crazy. Completely crazy.
