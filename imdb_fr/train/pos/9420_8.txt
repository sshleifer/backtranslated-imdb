The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing's studies did so well in the '40s and' 50s. His intrigue follows a man who invents a garment that is neither dirty nor dirty. does not break. Of course, this is a major breakthrough in the textile world. However, things are not so simple, because the clothing will threaten the lifestyle of many people, including the manufacturers of sheets, the workforce of the cloth factory and even an old lady who washed every weeks. The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances and how they do not always help; As the old woman said at one point in the film, "Why can not you leave things in peace, scientists?" <br /> <br /> Like many Ealing comedies, this one stars Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor. he has the ability to light the screen of his presence (and he does it in this film, literally), but he also manages to portray his characters in a realistic and credible way. He is appropriately scary in this film and he captures the ideal atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious scientist, but slightly naive. Joan Greenwood, the deep-voiced actress who co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine movie "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would continue to star in Alfred's Guinness in Batman movies . Playing in the movie is not always great, but it is still decent and fits the movie. <br /> <br /> The Man in White Costume is an intelligent, stimulating comedy full of moral spirit. The comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film is not supposed to be a film that provokes laughter, so it's forgivable. I recommend this film, basically, to all movie fans.
