It's a trio of tales, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali", on an experimental commune (or something like that) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which took people on a journey inside 'themselves and in the realm of the unknown, and left a little damage here and there, I would say. Several years later, some of this damage is still present and waiting for the right moment to come forward. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously. In fact, he was torn apart and the suspect was a man who might not exist. Seems that this woman is able to project an inner demon, or discovers the sister of the man who was killed when she tries to talk to this woman while pretending to be a journalist. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". He is a skinhead, a speed maniac, and he is sent to a psychiatrist who is a former member of this commune. The good doctor helps the young man realize his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer who tries to "heal" this woman who was part of this town and loose a kind of demon who lived in this woman, but we can wonder if he did it or not because she could not survive in her anymore. These three stories are rather scary and suspenseful, because you never really know what to expect, and the principle and settings are so different from those of conventional horror movies that they add to the strangeness. It sounds like a budget and a budget sensation, but it also manages to create a rather scary atmosphere to his credit. I watched it with my mouth open a good deal of time and when the real scares (and gore) arrived, it hit pretty hard. I found this film very interesting and disturbing and I liked it a lot. A good little find, this one, I would give 8 out of 10.
