Anchors Aweigh is one of the first musicals, with several memorable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with Jerry the mouse, Kelly dancing with Sharon McManus, age 7, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi on piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi driving , And much more. The Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from below, through transparent keys, and Grayson singing, seen through the viewfinder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you are involved in the enthusiasm of Kelly & Sinatra. Sailors on leave, they have to bring home a fleeing boy (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls in love with her aunt. To prepare with aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests Sinatra to audition him with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive in this one, and in his own sung words, he falls in love too quickly. As they try to contact Iturbi, who is never available, he starts cracking another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is falling in love with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the animation / cartoon sequence combination with Tom and Jerry, but there are many more that deserve a glance. I give it nine stars because, even though it's not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - this is one of the first in their class of Large productions Technicolor (perhaps Meet Me In Saint Louis was the first), and better than most others.
