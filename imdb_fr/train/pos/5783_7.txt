I read reviews of Kerching on IMDb and, frankly, I have not seen any positive reviews so far. I really like Kerching. Kerching talks about a teenager named Taj Lewis. In order to earn a million pounds for his mother, he creates a website called rudeboy. The website offers a lot of interesting things, if only Taj, and his 2 friends, Danny and Seymour, can prevent Taj from being exposed. I find this show quite funny and I like to watch it. The acting is O.K., but it can really be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, a friend of Taj, his stupidity is what makes him funny. and Taj's other friend, Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the cafe called "The Chill". We never see it, we only hear it. Taj's youngest brother, Omar, and his older sister, Missy, are also funny. And Missy's best friend, Kareesha. So many times that Taj's has almost been exposed, almost. In addition to comedy, the Kerching drama such as love life and the loss of loved ones makes this program great.
