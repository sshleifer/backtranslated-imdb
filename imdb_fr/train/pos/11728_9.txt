There are two things I love about Elvira, and they're both bigger than she and she's hiding them, her mind and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show how funny it can be or attract attention. Resembling a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits the domain of a distant relative before discovering that she is truly the heiress of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been a lot more scary and scary. It's mostly a flat camper that contains so many bad references to horror movies, like the rioting crowd or the fleeing heroine who stumbles and falls on his heels. What I prefer is when she uses her wonderful gifts to break the chains that keep her locked in the graveyard. The end is sodic sweet as if it was written by the Brady, but the act of Las Vegas in the end seems too grandiose for this type of film.
