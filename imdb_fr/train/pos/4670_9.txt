Those who only remember Sir Peter Ustinov, Hercule Poirot or a professional storyteller, would do well to look for that charming piece of satire from the late 60's. Ustinov plays the role of a convicted money-grabber. sees for the first time on his last day in prison where he prepares the income statement of the prison director) who, feeling that the future is in the computer, poses (by means of a stolen identity theft ) An IT expert trying to infiltrate a US multinational. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is in top form, as is the lovely Maggie Smith, presented here as a cockney-prone bird-dolly-stranger. Bob Newhart also performs a fun performance as a suspicious leader who designs Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is very sordid as the patron of the feminization of Ustinov and Newhart. <br /> <br /> What do I like especially about this film? It's not only a well-thought "caper film", but it's also a touching love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing because the two misfits fall in love (the whole scene of the card game is particularly effective.) <br /> <br /> So, what should not be loved ? Well, the screenplay is no more computer-savvy than most movies (hardly at all), even if it captures the commercial computing feel of the 1960s sixty. In addition, there are some small intrigue issues that you probably will not notice until the second or third reading, but I consider them to be a bit of a nuisance. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a movie that is worth looking for, and after seeing it once, you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
