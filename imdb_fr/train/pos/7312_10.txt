It took me a long time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a kid, I remember really enjoying the suites, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still consider to be the best sequel to Halloween. But I thought the first one was slow and took too much time to get to the goal. I have watched it many times recently and now know that I was wrong. Today, I really understand this film, its meaning, all the feeling of this masterpiece of horror. It's not about blood and blood. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's the worst night of Laurie Strode's short life. It's about the night his demented brother returns home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is supposed to be scary and I think it's doing very well. It's also one of the first slasher movies, a sub-genre of horror I've always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, scary music and talented young actors, such as Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Do I need to say more? Anyone who has never seen it, horror fan or not, should do their homework right now. Very strongly recommended!
