I could not believe the low IMDb rating of 5.6 on Johnny Dangerously at the time I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote this memorable comedy piece as much as I could. Seriously, to get such a low score, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very superficial and open mind. If you do not like humorous movies, do not look at them! Combining absurd humor, good narration and an exceptional rhythm given by multiple gags, this film made its way into my DVD collection. Not to mention the visual jokes embedded here and there, and of course, the use of "winks" and "clich√©s" inspired by our favorite organized crime movies. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie to a lot of people and, being presented without any particular expectations (except maybe watching a comedy), I should have the same mindset as watching n any movie - They all loved it. It's okay, it's not long to look and there's absolutely no slowing down in the evolution of the story, which I think is really simple. Of course it's not perfect, some gags are a little short, but no movie is perfect, especially when you consider the other opinions you have. That's why I rated this film 9 out of 10. This film is in my opinion a precursor like "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of comedies absurd but well thought out. Which nowadays is more and more absurd while reducing the thought and ingenuity side. Sometimes gags need more culture than many people imagine to be understood correctly, if at all. Finally, I would like to say: watch for yourself, do not follow Joe's words, and if you do not like it, you'll know it's really not good for your tastes, which is understandable, but unlikely in my opinion.
