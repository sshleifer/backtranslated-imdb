If you want your vision of Chaplin to be limited to an adorable vagabond and your belly mocks the pathetic, watch something else. If, however, you like burlesque comedy performed by one of the best, do not miss this one. <br /> <br /> The image is that of the tramp who can not really have the girl. He notices another couple kissing on a park bench and he amuses himself by spoiling their pleasure. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "Park Comedies", filmed in Mack Sennett Park, with pickpockets, police and couples. These shorts work because the format allows Chaplin to shine as he goes through delicate situations. <br /> <br /> I checked the box because it could be considered a spoiler, although it is not the case if you have seen these films. Everyone is in the pond except Chaplin. He recovers the girl, who in this case was played by Minta Durfee and his wife, Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
