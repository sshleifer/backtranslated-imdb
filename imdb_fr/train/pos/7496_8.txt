<br /> <br /> I disagree with the comments of the other critic for the simple reason that it is a MYSTERY FILM and not a supernatural! This is not the only movie to have an apparently "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out to be very mundance. <br /> <br /> Other films that come to my mind are Edgar Wallace's "Before Dawn". "and the (most famous)" Vampire Brand ". <br /> <br /> The film does a great job creating a" phantasmagorical atmosphere ", similar to DRACULA, when Renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle or in MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, when the two characters stand Through the windows of the ruins of the castle, you will see a "corpse" playing an organ, while Luna goes down with wings! VERY surreal! <br /> < br /> If we like these atmospheric touches (often silent), THIS film is a MUST! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel
