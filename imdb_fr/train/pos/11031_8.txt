The best action movie of Sly. This is an extremely enjoyable movie with interesting characters, solid performances and the direction of Renny Harlins is ensured with elegance. Stallone is rarely as interesting in his action films and he certainly has some in terms of action scenes. It was one of the best action movies of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable of the '90s, a classic of its kind. As a fan of Stallone, I come back on this experience with good memories. A lot of super action and Sly in the form of a man of action. Action fans enjoy this movie because it has all the features that make it a good movie. The film has a beautiful appearance and the support of Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
