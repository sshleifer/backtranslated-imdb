......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is a lot less explicit (or not even) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new subject for Bollywood. The subject has been accepted but he is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. To tell you the truth, the subject is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has its number of shots. The beginning of the film is presented in a very "filmi" way. There are very small holes in the plot. The film continues once Rani is miscarried where you feel you are looking at something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the whole family sequence was exaggerated at first. The acting game could not have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses and sometimes lets you down. There, he gave one of the best performances. On top of that, his role is so well written that you applaud whenever he solves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was adequate. Throughout the film, his character is the most sensitive, but Preity Zinta the shadow more and more. Preity Zinta is a perfect picture. Of the three, she gives everyone a run for their money. It's amazing how she can be so convincing when she's innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from your girl next door. This role is one of the reasons I consider it high. Supportive actors are like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, but I found them tolerable here. The songs are pretty good. The title song is my favorite with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henn√©) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the View of the World) are two songs that perfectly match the movie. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been shortened while the number one, Punjabi, seemed boring, even though he had danced well. Otherwise, the movie is really worth a look.
