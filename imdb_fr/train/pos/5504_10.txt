I just saw that last night, it was broadcast in the "Passionate Eye" series of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It was screened recently (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival and many others. It's a pretty remarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the midst of the events at the time of the coup. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it stands. Of course, they have their own ideological perspective (which they highlight), but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus their attention on the events, the people, the context and the story led to the coup. As a film, it is not stylistic or aesthetic, and I think it should be. What we get to see what "integrated" journalism really should be. What we see is a remarkable story of a country fighting for democracy ... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who really cares about his people ... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate, military and media interests. combine to lead the coup d'Ã©tat of a democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historic event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
