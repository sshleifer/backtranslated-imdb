We could still use Black Adder even today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson taking over the role of assistant prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational with Prince George and magician Edmund and his brilliant assistant. I love the episode in which Kenneth Connor plays the role of a British thespian. Each time, Edmund says Macbeth. The two thespians make a silly little act to ward off evil spirits. These are the funniest things you will see. Of course, nothing of this genius and comic genius could exist without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind films like Love Actually, The Blue Line Thin, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and fun at the same time. Last night, Saturday Night Live, I was hoping that Hugh Laurie would pay tribute to his British humor past. If the SNL gang were doing research, they would know how much it was a treasure to let Hugh Laurie honor their scene.
