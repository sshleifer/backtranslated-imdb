I remember very well having seen this at the age of 3, and then my parents accidentally stuck it to a few seconds with another cartoon. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and, as I could get a better understanding of it, I thought it was a good movie at the time. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I rediscovered it through articles / video clips on the internet and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's always good with children, but for us, 20-30 years ago, there is definitely "sect status" written on it. It is unfortunate that the original production has gone through a painful process. If Fox gave him enough time, he would probably be more recognizable to the public today. Maybe if they had to do it again with a totally different story and a cast of the all-star voice, it might be, but it's up to Fox to decide. I'm walking around here, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be better than awesome.
