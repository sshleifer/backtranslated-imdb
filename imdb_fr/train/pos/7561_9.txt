The version I saw of this movie was the Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a big word in it. <br /> <br /> This movie was funny like hell. It was also true to the bone. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or the surrounding area, you'll understand humor. Otherwise, you may not be able to understand everything. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the industry struggling to make a breakthrough is a rare jewel. It's written that it's a drama, but it's as dramatic as Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is beautiful, as always, as a secondary actor. Jamie Kennedy was able to stand well. His performance is particularly impressive during the poodle scene. The only downside was Carmen Electra but we can not have everything.
