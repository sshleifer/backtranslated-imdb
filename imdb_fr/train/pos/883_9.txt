I sat down to watch "Read My Lips", a plate of Freedom Fries in front of me. The food was quickly forgotten when the director and co-author of the original and superb thriller, Jacques Audiard, captivated me. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is the secretary of a company that develops major construction projects. In fact, she has important responsibilities that are not often assigned to secretaries and she is capable and ambitious. And upset by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward. <br /> <br /> Work faster than necessary, Carla is then entrusted with the hiring of a secretary. Enter the former prisoner and the general layman Paul (Vincent Cassel). He is lying on his skills and in fact has none that a legitimate business might need. After Paul's initial misunderstanding about Carla's interest in him, the two men become allies. An offbeat friendship begins. In a cascade that would have made the real Carla a major competitor of "The Apprentice", she prevails over her selfish opponent at work with Paul's connivance. Leave the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is practically deaf without her hearing aid. With her, she hears almost normally. She turns off the hearing aid to isolate herself from unpleasant noises and annoying people. She is also very lonely. A heroic make-up effort has been made to make her look simple, but she's really beautiful. She does not have a boyfriend. She keeps the children so that a friend can have an affair (it's a French film). Worse and humiliating, she accepts the invitation of a girlfriend who begs her to hang out somewhere while this married friend has her with her mistress in Carla's bed. Not nice. <br /> <br /> While Carla and Paul know each other better, the barely repressed side of the criminal, who is not so old, is emerging. By the way, the relationship between Paul and his parole officer perfectly complements the main plot and has his own big surprise. <br /> <br /> "Read My Lips?" Ingenious, Paul recognizes that Carla's ability to read the lips, even at a considerable distance, is more than just the sleight of hand she seems to be. <br /> <br /> From here, a hug develops. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real criminal and weird couple. She wants love but will also accept money. He wants it somehow, but business must come before a possible erotic satiety. Together, Cassel and Devos are powerful actors who lead an unusual crime story in a very compelling way. <br /> <br /> Rent it or buy it, but if you like a good crime story, go for "Read My Lips". And you might want to look at it several times: I do it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
