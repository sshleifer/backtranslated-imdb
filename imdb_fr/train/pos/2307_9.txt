I must say that this movie is really amazing and comforting. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not that bad either! it's so sweet to see Dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and warms me up at the same time as Short falls in love with Maureen. However, it's even sweeter to watch how much he cares about Dani. I must admit that I wanted him to be in love with Dani at the end. it's so cute to see her fall for him, I did not want her to break her heart so badly. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen happened in this movie. Watching him die made me cry a whole day. I could not believe it. However, never has a more amorous relationship been shown in a film, then Maureen and Dani. they can really go through anything. I'm giving a 9 to this movie because I did not want Court to die, but it was still one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.
