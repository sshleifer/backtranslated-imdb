Spoilers - to the extent that I describe the characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> It's a quality film. The subject is both dark and striking. The obstinate determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply captivating. With all the excuses addressed to him, his executioner, a continuously applied expression, serves the character well. As we would say in England the character of the television series Inspector Taggart, it will necessarily be sinister because he sees three murders a week. Well, that's not quite right, because Chikatila has worked for many years ... <br /> <br /> You have a real idea of ​​the blind resistance of the bureaucracy of the USSR, described with brio by Joss Ackland (which often seems like this kind of role). <br /> <br /> A key character (and I'm writing this as the Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake is shown on BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's character "Mikhail Fetisov". His silent support of Burakov is unshakeable. And it persists throughout Perestroika and encourages the FBI to profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> It's a must, as far as I'm concerned.
