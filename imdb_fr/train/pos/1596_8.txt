Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good interlocutors - that's where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years - still in love. From Aiello to John Mahoney, the entire cast does a very good job. It shows a real slice of life. Although I've seen this a long time ago, I'm glad Cage was finally catapulted to where he was recognized in Hollywood for his talent. From music to opera scenes to cooking table arguments, it's a very entertaining film.
