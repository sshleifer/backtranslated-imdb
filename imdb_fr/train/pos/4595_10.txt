Jackie Chan is synonymous with waterfalls. This film never disappoints you. The first chase scene and the last drop-down stage of the post are so risky that a miracle, if it knows the meaning of fear. This film is very close to the best of Jackie, who is PROJECT A.But the The main difference being that PROJECT A contains three stars where, as in this movie, Jackie is wearing the film entirely on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why this film has made Jackie a bigger martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee. The film has nice comedic touches too. What makes this film work is Jakie's ability to show his venerable side, his contract with the typical martial arts story. This film was followed by a sequel that was good but was quite docile compared to its predecessor.
