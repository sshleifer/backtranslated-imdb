I see a lot of very negative comments from people who wrote in August, although the film did not come out in the United States at least until mid-September. Maybe it was unhappy expatriates living in South Korea who saw him early. I am in the United States and I just saw him today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we are all used to this in many other films. It was not at all difficult to follow. The acting was weak, but the others were very good. There was humor everywhere too. I noted it at 8 because I had a good time looking at it, that's what I looked for.
