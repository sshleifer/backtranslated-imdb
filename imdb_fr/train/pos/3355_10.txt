May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for a historic meeting with Mussolini.Emotions, tensions and forms of assertiveness. an empty city, a housewife and a journalist. The meeting of two different worlds. Refuge for a mother with a sad life. Short filling for a classic victim. A story of loneliness and silence. About the shape of the corners of life and desire as a form of combat. The great character - a talented book in a springtime afternoon. This film is a remarkable poem for the art of describing the nuances of common loneliness. A plea for an ineffable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. The images of Il Duce, the clumsiness of Antonietta, the patience and the fragile tension of Gabriele, the art of staging the meaning of the scenario thanks to two great actors make this film sublime, a foretaste of subtle delicacy , a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict, about the essence of life and the repulsive character of all tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent acting game. A clear masterpiece.
