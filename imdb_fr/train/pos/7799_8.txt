Very slow, but very structured and ultimately very touching. A beautiful, very realistic look in a small Florida seaside town in the middle of winter - I went there and that's absolutely right. <br /> <br /> It's also the first feature film by actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this film is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters and I recently rented "Ruby" again. Except the clothes of the 80s, he held up well. Ashely is so radiant and moving here that it's hard to think about his future career without making a face. Boy, talk about not fulfilling your promise at first! Anyone who would see Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" would assume that this elegant and natural beauty is found in all kinds of interesting art films and serious actors - she has become the favorite girl of silly action movies and movies slasher! Very disappointing, but at least we have preserved this great performance to showcase its early promise. <br /> <br /> As some commentators say, it's not for everyone, because the pace is very slow. It's not an action movie, it's not really a romance. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent character study) treats the life of this ordinary young woman with deep respect, allowing her to build her story slowly and in great detail. In this way, I think this is one of the most moving and respectful stories about the age of young women that I can remember - it's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she has lost her virginity, "but of her life choices and growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A beautiful movie, if you take the time to look at it ... I think it would really be a great movie to show to teens and girls (or boys) and their give a chance to think and discuss. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to director Nunez, who also wrote the screenplay, which is so realistic and detailed that I assumed throughout the film that it was based. on a novel or a feminine memoir, but in fact it is the original work of Mr. Nunez. Ranked 8 out of 10.
