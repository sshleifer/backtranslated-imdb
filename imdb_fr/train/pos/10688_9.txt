I did not really know what to expect when I watched the movie, apart from the slightly surreal basic plot that a single man orders a Russian bride to go on the Internet. That and that had Nicole Kidman inside. However, I absolutely loved the movie and went out thinking "Wow". <br /> <br /> Refreshing, the film is going well, with some surprises at every corner. The relationships in the movie are credible. Nicole and Chaplin work wonderfully against each other. The humor is subtle, with superb "Office" type scenes in the bank, and the thriller element adds tension without being Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is about real people in an unusual situation. It is less heroism than delicate relationships. British cinema at its best ... <br /> <br /> (9/10)
