An American in Paris was, in many ways, the ultimate blend of Hollywood art and Hollywood comedy. Built at the pinnacle of MGM's power as a musical powerhouse, the film features memorable music by the Gershwins, rightly called the 20th century equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also up to his powers in this film, although it can be said rightly that this film was just the warm up of his best work in Singin 'in the Rain (1952). Both films are in fact closely related. In addition to the Arthur Freed connection, the Melody Broadway segment in "Rain" owes its existence to the incredible American sequence of Paris Ballet in this film. This may be the only time a dance number is mentioned in the opening credits of the film. And that deserved, because it highlights the skills of Gene Kelly as a dancer and choreographer. <br /> <br /> The distribution of the film is always excellent. Leslie Caron, who is making her film debut incredibly, shows a maturity that makes her think that she has been making movies for years. His introductory sequence to dance, and then his work on the Ballet, provide surprisingly sexy moments riveted in MGM Musicals solely by the works of Cyd Charisse in Singin 'in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious as a stoic friend of Kelly, who makes two of the best moments of the film: during the late-night sequence (which I will not give to those who have not seen the film) and one the most memorable musical numbers of the film. who combines his incredible pianist talents with state-of-the-art special effects (for the time). <br /> <br /> Georges Guetary is the most romantic rival of Kelly, his romantic rival, although he receives some strong moments on the musical level. Nina Foch as the romantic rival of Leslie Caron. The May-December relationship between Kelly and Nina reminded me of the same "kept" relationship that George Peppard and Patricia Neal had in Breakfast at Tiffany's. <br /> <br /> The film contains some elements it's less satisfying for me than Singin 'in the Rain. The Ballet, although sumptuous and well produced, does not really fit with the rest of the film. Without revealing the plot, the Ballet occurs without real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody, it really has nothing to do with intrigue - and in the best musicals, the songs always have a reason to be. <br /> <br /> Worse, it's the end of the film that happens immediately after the Ballet. Although the end should not be a surprise (it's a MGM musical, after all), I was hoping for a little more ... a movie after the end of the Ballet. It's as if the director Vincente Minnelli felt he could not follow the Ballet with nothing else. The movie literally let me down. <br /> <br /> Next to this negative point, an American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best Hollywood musicals. It does not really reach the heights of Singin 'in the Rain, but it comes close to it and it speaks to the skills of Gene Kelly as one of the greatest dancers of all time.
