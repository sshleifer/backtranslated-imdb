This is the only movie to see if you should get married or if you are a married couple. The film tells the story of a couple in Italy and discusses difficult topics such as abortion, infidelity, the reconciliation of work and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" that we know today in the world is terrible and this film will surely make you think. <br /> <br /> Must see. I hope it will be distributed as it should be. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast and the director. <br /> <br /> Two congratulations and a 10-star rating from me!
