A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... it's a wonderful movie that I can watch again and again. It's certainly one of the top ten comedies. With a superb cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau write a perfect scenario for Neil Simon based on his piece. <br /> <br /> It's a real situation perfectly realized. If you have a digital cable, you get the menu at the bottom of the screen to give what's on. This usually gives *** to this movie, but in reality, it deserves stars ****. If you really watch this movie, it can be said that it will be as fun and cool in a hundred years.
