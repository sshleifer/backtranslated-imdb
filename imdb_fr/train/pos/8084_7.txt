<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the other night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years now since I graduated high school. I did not grow up in this movie ... maybe my mother kept me away. This is definitely not for children. Not that it's graphically bad, but that the themes are realistically addressed by most 10-year-olds. Overall, the animation was excellent since it was done in 1978/1979. I thought that the story followed the book quite well in a vague sense. But I'm disturbed by the fact that Bashki did not just add another 40 minutes and added the parts of the Return of the King. That would have made it the ultimate movie. I was disturbed by its abrupt end, and when I heard that the Return of the King was nil, I got even more worried. Too bad it's not a big animated film. He could have collected a higher vote from me. I give him a 7. I only hope that Peter Jackson will do justice to the books with the new live action LOTR.
