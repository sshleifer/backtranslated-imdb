This movie looked like a slasher classic from the 80s, which is my favorite genre, so when I saw it was free on demand, I had to watch it! It stars Caroline Munro, of Dr. Phibes' two films (his wife is dead!), Dracula AD 1972, Sinbad's Golden Journey, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac and without a face. <Br/> <br /> Presented by those behind Do not open before Christmas and pieces, here's what I think about it ... <br /> <br /> It opens April Fool's Day , where a group of kids play an elaborate joke on the school's nerd - promising him sex in the shower and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (while still naked!). The coach puts an end to this, but both sides swear revenge. But, the cool children end up burning the nerd alive. <br /> <br /> Cut to the future and its high school meeting, or at least they think so (bwahahha?). The only ones to receive invitations were the gang that had burned the child and his April Fools (or really, the day before April, but the fun starts at midnight). Yet they do not see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until dark. Then they finally enter the school and it starts to rage. <br /> <br /> Inside, they find food / drinks and a small sanctuary for each of them, each of their lockers and their belongings, as well as Marty's locker (the nerds ). and directory. They also find the old black janitor / guardian who spends his time saying "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I do not want any problems, sir!" and then is killed instantly. Character rather useless, but it still remains my favorite. <br /> <br /> The film takes a page from the book of Alien, in a deliciously bloody way that you just have to see! That's when everyone realizes that they are here to die and that they start to panic, with the exception of Shirley, who decides that it would be better to take a bath in the showers of old school at a time like this. Of course, he releases blood and acid and his face fades (very cool, you notice). The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs and Marty kills everyone with a jester mask. What is their plan? "All we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon, Marty will not kill us by midday!" Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently, you can only kill at night. But will they survive all night? Who will live and who will die? And why do all bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal this great movie to find out! The film is actually very good, full of clich√©s (the car does not start, DAMMIT!) And just fun. Not to mention that they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to everyone! And, not to mention, he has a Spin Off! Cutting Class 1989 is a derivative of this slasher gem, and this film begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people fucking, the guy wants to finish but the girl does not "Speak with me, Frank !!" she screams "Uh ... tits!" "Dirtier" "Uh ... tits, tits, breasts, f * ck." It seems to work for her and at its peak, the killer electrocutes them both!
