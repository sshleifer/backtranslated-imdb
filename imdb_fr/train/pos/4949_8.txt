10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of those images "under the radar" bathing in the simplicity of independent films: honest and ad hoc performances of its two protagonists - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, who form a complementary, if not improbable, duo. What's good is that this whole movie looks unlikely despite its "road movie" roots. How does the anonymous character of Morgan Freeman come psychically (not physically) to meet her with this tired check-out girl who maintains an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor our role) is somehow left to our testimony more than to deduce from this, and their witty joke - two people on both sides of society - is deceptively simple. So, in a word, when there is no blow! Moments of shocking revelations, this film is a small piece of original mood that was probably lost in the mix of independent films released in 2006, but deserves to be seen, if only for its honesty.
