After a long week behind the desk making all these serious dam decisions, this movie is a great way to relax.

Jack Nicholson's impressions shine through this extra-terrestrial face with his dark sunglasses and leather jacket. And always remember to be wary of the 'donut of death!' Keep in mind the number one rule of this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and "Prepare to die from dirt, mud!" You just have to see it for yourself.
