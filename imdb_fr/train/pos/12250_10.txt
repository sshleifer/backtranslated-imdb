Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! Too bad that Knightly is not as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emma's father. I like the final scene (which is an addition to the novel, but well written) when the harvest has arrived and Knightly is dining with his workers and high society friends. Emma has to show that she accepts that now. She's a changed woman. It's too much, too fast, but okay. I will buy. Samantha Bond plays Emma's former housekeeper and confidante. She is marvellous. just as I would have imagined. I believe that when the UK does a Jane Austen, it's the best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this one!
