I really enjoyed The Night Listener. This is one of the best movies of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, all the actors were very good. All played just the right notes for their characters - neither too much nor too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is great as a mom and never goes too far. Everyone is very believable. <br /> <br /> This is a short film of just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images were cut in the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and did it in a simple way, which is a refreshing change for many filmmakers who seem to think The job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and to tell it well. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by surveys and ads. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story well told. If you expect Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film is the end. The director might have left a little more to the imagination of the public, but it is a small detail.
