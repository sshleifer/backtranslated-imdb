The drama club at my school will air this show in the spring of 2002 and I only hope we are as good as that! I recently watched this movie as a kind of "search" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I would just like to say that Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! The cast of this movie was just (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my god, is there anything he can not do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson of all time - I particularly loved all his fun facial expressions and his dance during "Put a Happy Face!" He is so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable. Tyne Daly was hilarious as Albert's odious mother and George Wendt was superb as Mr. McAfee annoyed (however, I loved Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau made me crack like Ursula Merkle; she really pounded it! And Marc Kudisch was a great Conrad Birdie ... "Suffer!" do not understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - What was it? I mean, she's really pretty and very talented, but ... she looks a bit too old for the role. Uh, maybe I'm delusional. <br /> <br /> All right, all right, I highly recommend this movie. That will leave you smiling! <br /> <br />
