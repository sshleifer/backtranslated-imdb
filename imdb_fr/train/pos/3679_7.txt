I had just watched the film two days ago and I was full of anticipation, being that Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and that I spent 18 very romantic months in the 80s. I was a little disappointed to see that most of these vignettes, although original and artistic, do not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well. Not enough romanticism! We did not see any of the tree-lined boulevards ... There was too much darkness, not only literally but figuratively. It seemed that some of the intrigues manipulated the viewer and dropped him "flat" (the sequence of the Marais, the sequence of the hairdresser, gave two examples). The edifying ones, the good ones: the Mime sequence, the cemetery, the Montmartre (although that leaves too much to understand the spectator), the vignette "Cowboy" and the Sacred Heart - seemed to be rare and spaced, and I would have liked to have seen an actor as wonderful as Orlando Bloom being in something that would have shown more of his originality.
