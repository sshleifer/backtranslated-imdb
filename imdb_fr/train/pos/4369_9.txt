I loved this film. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some twists and characters were well rounded. "Rob Roy", however, scored on two fronts well above average. First, I rarely saw a "popular" film in which the quality of dialogue was so high. There were many verbal nicks and pushes to accompany the brilliantly choreographed sword game. I could give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film included a rarely recognized principle. For a drama to succeed, you need not only a hero, but also a truly credible villain. If you do not have one, there is not much joy to motivate the good ones. And "Rob Roy" does not have one, but three: the Earl of Montrose, his servant Kilairn and Archie. Not one-dimensional villains either, but completely opulent and very mean. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart" - there is more dialogue, and the accents are a bit harsh, but it's a much smarter and subtle piece. (Like I said, I loved this movie!)
