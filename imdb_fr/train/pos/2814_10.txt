This is the best film ever made on the subject of AIDS. It's a documentary about two men who live with this disease and die of it. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny and incredibly moving. It is above all an incredible love story. Make sure you have some handkerchiefs before watching this movie - you will need it. Extraordinary.
