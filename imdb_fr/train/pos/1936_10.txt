this independent film was one of the best movies at the high grass film festival I've ever seen there. I loved this film. There are so many great things about the movie that the casting and the team that I had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal. I thought that Avi was doing a great job in her role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely faithful to his role for a Disney actor. His talent has allowed him to move from comedy for teenagers to such an adult role, without any problem. The talent in the movie was simply amazing. Cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film, it's really a movie you should see. I think Mr. Gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission to his festival and that his parents have so much loved the movie when he won the favorite audience. and saw him again. it was really a great movie it was dark and funny and sad and really moving it was just fabulous. Honestly, I'm really excited about this movie and I really do not want to spoil it for those who have just seen it and really marvel. I think these filmmakers really have what it takes to go places and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
