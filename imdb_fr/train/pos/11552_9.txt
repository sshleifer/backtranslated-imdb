Here is another film that does not really need a recommendation. It's a very amusing and fun classic comedy that, of course, ultimately inspired a hit television series, which many would say was even better (I appreciate both personally). <br /> <br /> For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were weaned off the television show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe vice versa). But in both cases, we have four good actors who, in real life, looked so much like their movie counterparts that they managed to capture those characteristics. This is the humorous material of Neil Simon that is the key and from which come the bursts of laughter. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, this is the story of a neurotic and capricious freak freak (Lemmon) thrown by a 12-year-old marriage of his wife who has long suffered and who settles in the apartment in Manhattan where lives his friend completely irresponsible (Matthau). Combining these two unlikely roommates in the same four walls creates extremely funny situations.
