I love this series, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode, I could understand why people were disabled at first. The humor of the first episode is not the best, and they have trouble starting the series well. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become really nice characters. As a first episode, it really does not represent the rest of the series, which is really very good. The episode is not bad at all, but as the show progresses, it gets better and better, so watch several episodes before making any judgment about the quality of the show.
