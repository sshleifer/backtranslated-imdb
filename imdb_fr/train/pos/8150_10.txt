My, Kasi Lemmings is definitely a fair looking woman. This film is a lost jewel, a satirical "fake documentary" of the hip-hop scene of the early '90s, when MC Hammer was just beginning to collapse in that good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark on their picaresque journey of potential wealth and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, in the end, they finish their journey not far from their starting point, but at least a little wiser and a lot less naive. It's one of the best movies that no one has ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you like or hate, much like "Company Man" in this respect. I see this film as the thousand islands of upstate New York: it's a wonderful little secret you want to keep for yourself.
