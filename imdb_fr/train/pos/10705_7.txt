The trailer for this film did not do justice to the film. And although the film does not know what it really wanted to do, the first half of the film being a light, the romantic comedy and the second a more serious and romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I did. thought. be. This film was more of a date film, but the trailer made it a thriller that it never really was. Kidman, being one of my favorites, I am of course partial, but this film turned out to be a light film, sensitive, although a little weird, which deserved better. Three stars out of four. 9.5.02.
