This film was excellent - Tom Hulce's emotional power and Ray Liotta's performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this movie was out at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would have been at least nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. A must see!
