Brazilian films often receive more positive reviews than they really deserve. Incredibly enough, Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (original title, which producers have ruled out: God Against Everybody) got a very low average (GPA) on this site. He seems to be categorically rejected by the spectators in general. In fact, it's not so brutal. I mean with respect to graphic violence. Its brutality is intrinsic to the extent that it describes so-called lumpens, I mean oppressed citizens who actually possess high-tech equipment, who coldly execute murder orders in exchange for "grana gra√∫da". Is this postmodern man? Is his only concern a layman quick, almost impersonal, ultra permissive, in the midst of satiating meals? The photo is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004, to date. His Godard's brilliant editing style, his curious counterpoints of soundtrack, his more than efficient overall distribution and, above all, his original narration, with subtle, non-chronological, hidden points that only appear in the epilogue, deserve at least one brand.
