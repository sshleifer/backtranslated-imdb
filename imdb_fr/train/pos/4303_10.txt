It is an excellent film with excellent distribution and very good actors. I do not get tired of watching him. I particularly like the scene where the characters of Danny Glover and Kevin Kline, including Simon and Mack, have a brunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems his manners are easy and you meet often. SO it's a very "real" movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes of the film, however, is at the beginning of the film when Simon arrives at the place where Mack's car broke down. The film also has a strong message and does not resemble a film stereotyped with a movie where a person preaches his gut in front of an audience. Instead, the emotions and situations of the actors deliver a powerful message that goes better without using words. Finally, Mary McDonell is brilliant, as always.
