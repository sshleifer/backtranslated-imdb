After seeing the terrible, terrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew I had to see him as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Pressing play to watch the trailer of what another aspiring filmmaker had been like before trying to give new depth to an existing character. But instead, we were greeted with a trailer made for a film that unfortunately does not exist, because I would like to see a finished film, even if it only lasted 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The best of the world is composed for BATMAN: DEAD END, then a few. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the next short film!
