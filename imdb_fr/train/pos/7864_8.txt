This is yet another "Madhur Bhandarkar" type film. I'm not sure why he has this obsession with showing cool concepts to Child's Filmy, but I find some of these scenes really disgusting! What's up? This is a beautiful piece made by Bhandarkar, where it shows the story of an entertainment journalist starring the star of the movie, Mr & Mrs Iyer. The particularity of this film is that it also covers the stories of people with whom this journalist communicates or befriends, such as his roommates, his colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people and others people, presented in the entertainment page n his diary. <br /> <br /> Note: This is another good performance from Ms. Iyer. She is likely to be noticed for this role. She plays selective roles but shines in them. It is much less glamorous and less beautiful in this film. But then, entertainment journalists are not supposed to overshadow the people they cover, right? Verdict: Madhur has come up with another good movie that shows very well the social problems. However, this film loses focus and we do not know what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Does he want to show us the pomp and glamor of the rich? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment journalist and compare it to the life of the real crime journalist? Does he want to tell us how the government and the rich people run the press? or does it try to illustrate the problems of child abuse and the popular people? Among the other concepts mentioned is the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co-stars if they wish enter Bollywood. <br /> <br /> It also explains how flying assistants get sick and tired after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying a lot of seniors, etc. He also talks about unhappy women and spoiled children in wealthy families. <br /> <br /> All this was acceptable to me .. being too complex for a average moviegoer, who just wants to relieve his stress from his daily work
