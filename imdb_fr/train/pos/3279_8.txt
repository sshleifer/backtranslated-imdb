I'm glad it's available on DVD now. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and style on flashing empty lights and constant loud noises. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have a short attention span or if you lack wit and imagination to engage with literary narration you will not like this movie. The reasons are fairly simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has successfully transposed the story of Catherine Storr's novel, "Marianne Dreams", into a screenplay. It is an unenviable task that anyone who has seen the film of a book will know for sure. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. It allows the director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a rarely seen way; they are engaged in the actor's job! I know, I know, the actors do their work and act instead of blaming themselves, a kaleidoscope of car chases, explosions and fierce fighting is a really rare treat, but it actually happens in this environment. movie. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the last reason why this is a film for the imaginative thinker and not the spoon-fed tabloid reader - apart from a solid storyline, the setting on the stage and the acting game, it is based on the atmosphere, suspense and horror implicit. If this is to be described as horror, the presentation of 'Paper House' goes more towards Sophocles than Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you like a lot of loud noises, explosions, constant cuts, and bright flashing colors, you'd better look at 'Transformers', but if you like a suspense story that takes place through a skilful and evocative use of narration without insulting your intelligence by forcing you to feed on cacophonic nonsense, then this may well be your thing.
