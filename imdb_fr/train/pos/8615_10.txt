I waited for the movie to come out for a while in Canada and when it was finally released, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed that. Of course, at first it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day - which makes it even sadder), but it stays with you. The next day, I thought about it again, because even if it revolves around something exhausting, you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story. How can a person be perceived as the link with so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded by so many things. And how Diane Keaton's character saves the rest of them just by being there. And how they save it too. It was an excellent movie and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides the perfect comic relief. It is certainly a film that will require a tissue box of paper, but that will stay long with you.
