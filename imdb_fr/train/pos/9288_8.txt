I found this touch surprisingly light in a 1950s culture-shock movie. John Wayne would hardly be his first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull in Harrods. But this time he had to play a much more passive role than his usual bluff, and he did his job in style. The Duke was a guy who could really do well. His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of time spent in front of a screen, he failed to dominate this film. Many of his good intentions came at harvest. He had no authority over anyone, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian. <br /> <br /> The story of American attempts to win the favor of an isolationist Japan was rather a swashbuckling political intrigue or hellish battles for leather. I can not comment on the accuracy of his research, but the strangeness of Eastern culture with Western sensibilities has been well demonstrated. There were many elaborately choreographed ceremonies involving what looked like this observer as an authentic costume and props. The sets were complex and detailed. <br /> <br /> The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added an extra element and prevented the film from turning into a mere political or flag effort. The script was good without being too wordy. There was a lot of Japanese dialogue, but the long periods of translation did not interfere with the story. It was nice to see lots of real oriental on the set. Whether or not Japanese, I can not say. But anyway they watched the game. At least the main roles were not played by Caucasians in transvestite attire, unlike other efforts such as "Blood Alley" (yes, I know they were Chinese) "The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness" or even "The King And I". Frankly, I enjoyed that more than any of these other films. The script was better to start. I never liked the songs of "The King And I" and I was not impressed by the heavily charged anti-communist subtext of "Blood Alley". I admit I have never seen this work before and found it very good compared to many of The Duke's most popular releases. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
