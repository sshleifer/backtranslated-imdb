8 simple rules to go out with my teenage daughter had a good start. The very talented Tom Shadyac was involved in the project. This meant that the comedy would be nothing short of spectacular, and that's exactly what happened: the show remains one of the coolest, funniest and most spiritual things in a long time. Every line, facial expression, casting choice, scene, everything is made to be perfect. There was not an episode after which I thought: "A man who was not as good as the rest". Each was a standout. Again, this is the kind of perfectionism we expect from Tom. For those who do not know it, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (first film), The Nutty Professor (first film) and Liar Liar. Quite a summary. He is a producer here and not a director, but his magic touch is felt in every episode. The family is composed of: <br /> <br /> The father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): nice, slightly neurotic, can to be a breeze From time to time, work as a sports writer. John unfortunately died in 2003, leaving a shining memory and almost sure cancellation by the costumes. <br /> <br /> Mother: Cate (Katey Sagal): Come on, who did not fall in love with Katey when she played Peg on Married With Children? Al Bundy was our hero. We viewers gave him the respect and love he never had. But without the nonchalant, parasitic and lazy lifestyle of Peg, Al would probably have been just another Chicago father instead of the mess that Peg (life, in fact) had caused him. Katey was a MILF at the time and still is: a brunette now (instead of a redhead) and still generous. Cate is the conservative mother and the loving woman. I know it sounds boring, but comically, it fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> The Ditty Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played to perfection by Kaley Cuoco): Almost never a fool was played so well. In addition to Gob on Arrested Development, Bridget could be a bum for any award attributed to this archetype. Bridget is superficial, self-centered, not very bright and a bit slutty in her eyes. She plays the role of blonde idiot better than anyone. Perfection. One of the highlights of the show. <br /> <br /> The Neglected Geek Girl: Kerry (Amy Davidson): A brunette and a geek, she has no love for life or circumstances. One feels neglected, underestimated and neglected most of the time. She is Bridget's younger sister (actually, she's older than her) and the extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes, for the biggest fun. <br /> <br /> The son: Rory (Martin Spanjers): was the second The funniest IMO character before Ritter died, then John passes, new characters arrive and Rory is no longer the aggressor of verbal troubles he was used to thinking of: it was mostly David Spade's character. <br /> <br /> These characters were the main ones at the time of John Ritter. Unfortunately, Larry Miller (one of my favorites), incredibly hilarious, did not have much time on the screen. He played the colleague / competitor Paul. After an aortic dissection that cost Ritter his life in 2003 (September 11), the show was on hold for a while. Nobody thought it could come back, but he did it later, with some new additions. It started the second phase of the show and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> The director of the school, strict and confident: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there in talk -shows. It was the first time I saw him doing anything. Impressed is the word I use. His performance was very impressive. Sad that he was not brought sooner. He also plays Cate's potential interest after Paul's death. The gradual progress towards this point (which would have seemed crazy at first) deserves a lot of praise. It has been done slowly, with care and excellence, with constant respect for Paul (Ritter). <br /> <br /> Grandpa's Attitude: Jim Egan (James Garner): A surprisingly welcome addition to the series, he was fodder cannon for "old" endless jokes, mostly ... <br /> > <br /> Unemployed 35-year-old half-brother, mother: CJ (played at incredibly funny heights by David Spade): I knew Spade was funny, I just did not know he was CE funny. In one way or another, the very familiar presence of Spade is felt in his character (as opposed to a separable character), which is understandable since he is a comic and he participates in a humorous show . This strange feeling is a bit like seeing someone borrow a lot of material from David Spade's appearances in movies, talk shows and functions (awards, etc.) and give a superb imitation of voice and style. Spade's comedy, except that it's Spade. By that I mean you realize that he's not trying to play another character, or any new character: he's the funny Spade we know, and he takes this pleasantly humorous form to the top. Each line he uttered, every sarcasm he engendered, all the classics, literally. Spade was crazy-funny; So, SO funny. <br /> <br /> The comedy and drama of the series have both increased after the return of the series, but the audience thought: "John has passed, it will never be the same again". This is understandable, given that this is a group of viewers (US viewers) who offered a free ride to "Yes, my dear," but canceled Andy Richter Controls the Universe in no time . As the quality of the show increased, his ratings dwindled Soon, it was not, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> And I kept the best for last: Married With Children fans will be happy. And my boy, what a pleasure. I'm still shivering just remembering it. It's such a good surprise that it would be crazy to ruin it, even if I do it legitimately under the pretext of "spoiler ...". Suffice to say that it is something you will NEVER forget. I know I'm not going to :-)
