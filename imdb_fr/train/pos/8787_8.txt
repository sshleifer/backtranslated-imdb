This film reinforced my opinion on Errol Flynn. While Flynn is of course best known for its know-how and sprezzatura (add some very disappointing European terms!), This film gives him the opportunity to stretch (although slightly) as an actor, a climber unscrupulous social with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The support cast is excellent; everyone seems well chosen for his role. <br /> <br /> History is changing rapidly and, although not profound (lacking, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to comment socially on the extremely unequal distribution of income during this period ). ), he certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is also reasonably true to the story. I also really enjoyed the beautiful 1880s performances in San Francisco. All in all, there is not much to dislike in this movie ... it's really worth the time to watch it.
