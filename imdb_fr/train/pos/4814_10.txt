I saw this on the big screen and I was encapsulated with it. The period of Queen Victoria's youth is a mystery and she perfectly describes how a girl was placed in one of the most important roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the acting is amazing, the story and the attention to detail are out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. It's funny how his mother is played by Elizabeth the 1st and William IV by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder) <br /> <br /> This portrait of Victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would have been in Jeremey Kyle Show if she had existed at the time: "My mother and her boyfriend try to steal my life. " <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of much of British history and the Commonwealth.
