I read most of the comments on this movie. I have seen this movie (and the entire series of prophecies) many times with family members of all ages. We all enjoyed and simply meditated on what we already knew by reading and studying the Bible on the rapture and the end times. No one was scared or traumatized as I read on some articles. The film is just based on biblical facts. I have seen many end-time films such as "Tribulation", "Armagedon", etc., and this one is by far one of the best to present Bible truths. It may not have a lot of interesting special effects like the current movies, but I think it's a good testimonial tool. This film and its series of prophecies can be viewed for free on this website HigherPraise.com, and judge for yourself. Blessings to all.
