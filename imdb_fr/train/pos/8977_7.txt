As a film, it is barely rated at 4, but for moviegoers from the 1940s, it's almost a must-see show and scores a 9 as a variety show! I was attracted by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the role of Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the superb performance of Doris Day. Apart from 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her put on a song as well as she does here. Randolph Scott is also memorable, although he does not see much time on the screen. I have not seen the movie for a long time, but I was pretty sure Humphrey Bogart would be there. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If this happens on a TV station near you, do not miss the Doris Day! <br /> <br />
