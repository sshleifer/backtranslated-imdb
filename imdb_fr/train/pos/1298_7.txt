A true anomaly in French cinema, this desperate work has no equivalent in contemporary production. We should rather look at the side of the wisp of Louis Malle (1963) to find something that is not completely different The efforts of Harel.

Strangely attached to the human race, he seems to live his life as a kind of entomologist, studying his colleagues. One of them draws his attention: Tisserand-Jos√© Garcia plays the most devaluing part of the decade. Then Tisserand will become a sort of prey: all his pessimism will dissipate on this poor man.
