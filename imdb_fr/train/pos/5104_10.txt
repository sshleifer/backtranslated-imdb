This is an intelligent lifestyle drama in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger perform two very credible performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the scene of country music and has helped to introduce America to the mechanical bull. If you like a good love movie, then you will love this movie.
