I saw this movie several times. I find that one of the funniest things to do is to simply look at the reactions of the different types of people who will see it. <br /> <br /> Type 1: The elderly. Many old Japanese go to this movie because they think it will be an honest samurai movie with a lot of swordplay and a lot of medieval Japanese dialogues. As soon as the two protagonists begin to debate horror films while cursing almost randomly in their sentences, the elderly go away, usually disgusted. <br /> <br /> Type 2: SNOB FILMS. These people think that, just because a movie is labeled "Independent", it will automatically be a shitty load that is hard to follow, too emotional, that may not be in English. Yet, they still see it just to sing praises about it later, so people think they're smart and cultured. They are really surprised when they see this movie. As soon as the blood begins to spill out in cartoons-inspired saber battles or the eccentric villain nicks a dog with his crossbow in a phone conversation, they will be so dismayed that they will come out. Some will just stay to see "how bad it is going to go" and later, they will rave about the horrible film that it was for their friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE LIVE ANIMALS OR SPECIAL EFFECTS RELATED TO A MATRIX. Sorry, the martial arts are pretty solid in the movie, but the director Yamasato does not really have the budget for that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Type 4: People without expectations. These are the people who really like the movie. Whether they have only heard of Blood of the Samurai, whether they picked it at random or they have fallen into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the ones who will laugh at all the jokes and enjoy the movie for what it is: ENTERTAINMENT. This film was not designed to illuminate or provoke a deep spiritual thought, it was (if I can borrow a line of dialogue from the film) to "really bang in the ass". And that's what he does. <br /> <br /> So, depending on the type of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this movie; However, if you enjoy the movie for what it is and you can enjoy excess blood and acting, then go see it and be sure to bring your friends.
