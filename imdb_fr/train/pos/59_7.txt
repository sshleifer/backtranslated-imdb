While I was the video store, I browsed the dollar rentals and came across this little gem. I do not know what it was about that, but I just had an instinct about it and wow, I was always right. <br /> <br /> The story centers on two girls who have just survived a shooting in a school. One of the girls is Alicia, a teenager who is the only witness to the attack and another is Deanna, another survivor who survived a bullet in the head with a miracle. Gathered together by fate, they slowly begin a beautiful and painful series of healings and passions. <br /> <br /> I hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what a performance of Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! The only complaint I would make is that the DVD was sorely lacking special features. Oh, and some of the cuts in the movie were quite shocking. But overall, it's an excellent movie.
