Although a 9 may seem unusually high for such a light film, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of 1930s and 1940s series detective films, it ranks among the best and compares very favorably to the "Thin" series of Powell. This does not mean that the movie looks like Thin Man's, because THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but rather a traditional detective film.Now, you'd think that not having Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic buddy (something that is found in almost all serial crime movies) for pleasure would be a detriment, but I did not miss them at all, as it was an exceptional case. well written - having a really interesting case as well as consistently excellent performances from everyone. <br /> <br /> The film starts at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, although this film Philo Vance actually does not spend much time at the show and the dogs are not a very important part of the film, instead a deeply hated man is killed and left in a completely closed room - an idea repeated in many other films p oliciers (such as the most strange case of Doctor Crime). However, the way all this is explained seems pretty credible and goes very well together, while maintaining my interest. I hope that the other crime films of the day have intrigues as intelligent and exceptional. This one is definitely a guardian.
