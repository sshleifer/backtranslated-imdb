Massive multiple chills in the back! I'm surprised there are people who did not like it! I saw him at 10 am and I was still scared! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! To shout loudly, I'm 22 years old !!! I mean, OK, dubbing, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the start, you hit again and again with relentless, ruthless and terrorist scenes! So many shots to date, no one fails to surprise / frighten! You know it happens, it happens, it happens, BOO! and you still jump from the chair. Take a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and do not look at him at night! Hat to the Japanese!
