This film has a very simple and yet intelligent principle: an unemployed person who tries to steal from a convenience store and the seller catches him in the act ... the thief escapes with the seller just after him. Meanwhile, the store clerk has problems with a low ranking Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Along the thief hunt, they attract the attention of the Yakuza who were looking for the convenience store clerk. The story then moves into high gear in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but is added with the dog running after the cat. The whole of the 2nd act of D.A.N.GN.N. Runner (may be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS") speaks of the hunt, and the pursuit continues to the point that at the end of the 2nd act, the hobo forgets why he is fleeing, and the gift Yakuza Do not remember which of the two guys he's chasing, or why he's running away from him. <br /> <br /> Similar to SABU's latest film, POSTMAN BLUES, most of the film is simply hunted and action, with lots of physical comedy and black humor injected to keep the audience engaged. What's missing is the end, at which the hunt ends when the three men are out of breath, and one of the most chaotic Mexican confrontations you'll see on a film that almost gives the impression that Sabu pays tribute to Tony Scott. TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
