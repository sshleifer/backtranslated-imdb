Okay, honestly, I saw the previews of this movie and I thought to myself what the producers thought? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could the monotone actor possibly compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, both had the kind of chemistry that showed intense solicitude without kissing. Even David's humor matched Jolie's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played very well to the psychopath, contrasting with the calmness with which David delivered situations putting his life in danger. Overall, I was very impressed with the writing and development of the character. I gave him 8 stars.
