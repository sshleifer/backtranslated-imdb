An excellent family film ... gives a lot to think about ... There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. Everything is just perfect. The scenario is awesome - it's so ... real ... such things could happen in everyone's life. And do not forget to act, it's great! Just look at Frankie and you'll know what I thought ... This photo is not to be missed!
