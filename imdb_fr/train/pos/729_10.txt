I love this film so much that I'm never tired of watching it. The only thing I really can not stand is when Riff is called a teenage lobotomy, but other than that, everything else is perfect. I've never been a fan of PJ Soles and it did not help me to know that she did not even know who the Ramones were until she shot this movie, but I can ignore her face instead sly. Most people who watch this over and over are Ramones fans and really ... that's the only reason I love him so much. I do not get tired of seeing DeeDee spoiling his pizza lines or Joey spoiling the teacher's name again and again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is to see them singing. Do you want to dance in the hallways of high school? I love. The special DVD edition contains a good retrospective, surprisingly, PJ Soles is not included. Maybe she was working on another project * laugh * In any case, it's a great movie, even better if you're a fan of Ramones.
