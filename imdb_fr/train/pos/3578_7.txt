Arnald Hillerman, age 12, accidentally kills his older brother, Eugene. His feelings are stopped by the fact that his family can not interact with him (or feel that it is not the right thing to do). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is the only one who seems to have compassion for him. Realism will captivate "true-2-life" moviegoers, but will not satisfy those who desire action and thrills.
