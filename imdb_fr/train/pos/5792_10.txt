This film is the only film to feature a scene in which Michael Jackson brandishes a Tommy pistol. Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it's really hilarious! It can be scary to see Jacko with his grandchildren, but this movie is also a star ............................... .. ......... wait, ..................... <br /> <br /> JOE PESCI !!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Think about it, Joe Pesci and Jacko with Tommy pistols, throwing coins in jukeboxes at about twenty meters?
