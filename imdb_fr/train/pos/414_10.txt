Cecil B. deMille has really created a classic and, after 7 decades, his western is presented as the Real McCoy, captivating, entertaining, spectacular; In no way obsolete. <br /> <br /> As a true DEADWOOD fan, I'm going to tell you about Gary Cooper's performances in Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor in Calamity Jane are much more focused. <br /> <br /> We have no more giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is one of the dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that has enjoyed a sustainable commercial life, decade after decade: published, reissued, reissued. Filmmakers like Spielberg, Jackson and Bruckheimer are like children playing in a sandbox. None of today's movies will be searched in 7 months, let alone 70 years.
