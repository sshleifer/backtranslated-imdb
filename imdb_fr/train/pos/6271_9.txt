I liked this film. It was pretty cool. Everything is there: cars, gunshots, fights and even a symbolic girl. He does not excel in any of these things except cars. A little shooting, a bit of fighting, a little DIY, and a LOT of cars, with a nice pursuit near the end. You can say that the jump is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the BDIM, it's possible, so the movie is not as bad as people are painting it. He has quality and I liked to watch him. In fact, I loved the movie. And I did not have to stop thinking about it. I did not always think "Is it possible?" or tramp like that. 9 out of 10
