Timeless musical jewel, with Gene Kelly in great shape, elegant direction by Vincente Minnelli and wonderful musical numbers. It's great entertainment from start to finish, one of those movies that people look at with a smile and say, "They do not do it like they used to!" But they never did it like that. The supreme musical sequence of 25 minutes without any dialogue is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. The magic of the film, clearly from the heart and soul of everyone involved. A must see!
