This is undeniably the scariest game I have ever played. It's not the average kind of shoot-all-that-moves fps (which I usually do), but an acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee. . ") and more any incredible atmosphere. I love Scrye, which allows you, in some places in the games, to see or hear events that have happened in the past. The only game I had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of play just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I'm a big fan of horror, especially Clive Barker's stories and movies, and participating in a horror story like this makes me want to create more games that showcase the atmosphere and a story. more engaging. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fan of fps, and the game was a bit short?)
