Do not believe all the negative reviews that this film receives. Yes, it is manufactured cheaply. Yes, the gore is laughable. And, yes, the acting is less than normal. However, this is a classic example of the first slasher movie, and if it's your "thing" (mine!), You'll enjoy this one. There are enough good aspects in this film to more than offset the disadvantages. On the one hand, Christopher Young's score, then unknown, is very scary and accentuates the violence perfectly. The end is a welcome break from the predictable optimistic end of most movies. Finally, the frame is what made the film for me. The directors of this film could have done a much better job by "dressing" the scenery to make it more credible as a college dormitory. However, if you can ignore this flaw, the setting is excellent. Four colleagues all alone in a huge abandoned and condemned building just waiting to be demolished ... this suggests a possibility. When you watch, let your imagination do some of the work and you can enjoy this movie as much as me.
