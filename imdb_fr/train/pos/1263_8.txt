I enjoyed this film, especially because I like to see Sean Connery play and it has the added bonus of being able to count on Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne. The story goes that a grandmother asks for Connery's help because her grandson is in jail and she says he was wrongly sentenced. At first, it appears that there were racist aspects to the case, but it turns out later that the senior officer was black himself and that he had done rather badly to force the boy to make confessions. Well, the boy tries to point to another murderer locked up in the same prison, about to be put to death. He is also particularly naughty, because he takes a lot of joy in what he did, writes to the parents of his victims and tries to get people to send them in the mail. Many twists in this one, some being somewhat unexpected. I just enjoyed the character of Sean Connery trying to make sense of this whole ordeal. The film has also made me crazy in some areas, especially when you find out what has finally happened. You get a very good interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, because they all shine pretty well in this one. In the end, this one is rather a suspense / thriller.
