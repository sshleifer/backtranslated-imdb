This film was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written and very appealing to those of us who are not really "conformist" movie buffs. Do not mistake yourself. Some great movies have great appeal, but when you watch a movie based on "everyone's watching it", you know you're either a man or you do not really feel like it. It had a subtle and charming humor - despite the fact that most people probably only look for evidence. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and I thought there was a lot more "personal" personality in this film. Has a call for children, as well as adults. Esp. good to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and innuendos on drugs! A great movie not to be overlooked based on public consumption. This one is an indispensable purchase.
