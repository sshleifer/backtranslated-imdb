Return to the lost world was shot immediately after the 1992 version of The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the same five people, led by Challenger, return to the plateau where a group started drilling for oil that threatens to destroy the land. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved, to the delight of the natives. <br /> <br /> As in The Lost World, the rare dinosaurs we see are rubber, including a T-Rex. and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner take over their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three of the other actors are back as well. <br /> <br /> Despite reading several negative reviews about it and these inexpensive looking rubber dinosaurs, I really liked Return to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
