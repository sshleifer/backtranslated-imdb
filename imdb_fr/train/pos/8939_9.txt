A powerful adaptation of the bestseller and the sensational play of Broadway on the life of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colored" sisters who have lived more than 100 years. Wonderfully played at their age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, respectively. , they tell their story in flashback to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. Flashback and today's scenes are not as inspiring as they are in the book, but are really powerful. However, some aspects of sisters' lives, such as their mother's racial origins and the reasons for their father's severe personality, are not clearly presented. You must read the book to fully understand these things. Which is just as good, because the book is just as great! Aside from these flaws, it is wonderfully directed and performed, particularly by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
