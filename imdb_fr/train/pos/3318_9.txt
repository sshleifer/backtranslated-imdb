A very cute movie with a good background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and movie addict, it hit a circuit for me. Lots of laughs and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real baseball players and real references to Bosox's past failures. And how enjoyable was it to watch a film about baseball without being excessively, excessively, selfishly, Kevin Costner, trying to make a critical audience believe? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young couple in love with Jimmy's "Jones" Bosox. It was a bit devious and out of the left field, but there are really fans of Sox who are also fanatics and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team. The film quickly progressed and the end, though predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular films, without being excessively pretentious. <br /> <br /> Willie Garson's return to the screen was also enjoyable. I still miss the very popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & the City. He's always funny, even when he talks or says very little. <br /> <br /> So buy two seats, popcorn, and get ready to have a good time. "Fever Pitch" is a winner.
