The Wooden Horse is a very intelligent film about a very intelligent and successful escape plan developed by British prisoners of war during the Second World War. He is superbly acted with an ironic sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acidic Leo Genn languages. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as two heroes. The direction is tense and fast. Highly recommended.
