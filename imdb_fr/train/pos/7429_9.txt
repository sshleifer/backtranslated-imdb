She is an extraordinary singer, who cares about nothing else !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments of all shows - without exception !! I'm glad she kept the camera for ten minutes - she deserves the status of an icon - that's the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time at the age of five and it had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the flaws (like Esther wanting to leave the Grammy right when announcing her award). <br /> <br /> But some of the other comments of the users are just fake - I mean, where is the free nudity - maybe we have seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if she has a big ego - so much the better! <br /> <br /> She deserved it.
