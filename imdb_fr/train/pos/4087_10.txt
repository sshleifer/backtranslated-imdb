I must say that I thought I saw everything. I am an extremely jaded movie buff. This film absolutely did not shock me. I have gone beyond this point. But that took me to some places of emotion where I did not know I could go. I did not know that I could ever find (ick) the idea of ​​erotic bestiality. Never ever never. Already. Already. But there. He did it. I must give credit to the director. He removed it. <br /> <br /> During the first 40 minutes, this movie is a total boredom. We start with very explicit pictures of two horses making love. After five minutes, I wondered if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then an old man in a wheelchair talks to another old man about two people getting married. Then a nervous type shaves. Then we see (briefly) a hot girl getting along with a butler (but it's very brief). At this point, I cursed the film aloud while trying to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep after about 40 minutes and I forced myself to finish it the next night. <br /> <br /> We finally have the good things when a girl (who knows who she is or whoever is in this movie) dreams of the destruction of a forest beast by a girl of the Victorian. The scene has been going on for a while and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole affair. He is beautifully shot, superbly edited and delivers the goods. They try to conclude the plot at the end and that makes sense, but that's not the case either. Never mind. I would definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes redeemed him completely.
