It's the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the film on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month, they were screening a Yugoslav film every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> The next week, there was another good movie (involving a train rather than a bus), which I do not remember the name. If you know it, please let me know! Anyway, how can I have the chance to see this movie ???? A DVD of this movie, where ??
