Superb casting, more please! <br /> <br /> If you can capture just about anything written by Plater (or interpreted by these wonderful actors). For those who do not know it, Plater has a real penchant for jazz, my recommendation is to see the trilogy "Beiderbecke" whenever you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz: the hot, the cool and the time does it start?"
