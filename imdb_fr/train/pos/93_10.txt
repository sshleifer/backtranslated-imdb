My first child was born the year of the release of this program and then I played the record album for boys every Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought a dozen copies and I always give them to friends and relatives at the time of starting a family ... it becomes invariably their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (probably made on DVD-R from video tapes) for sale on eBay. The one I bought is an excellent copy and it was great to see the show again after more than 25 years. Some songs in the series were not on the album and some of these songs were studio versions of the same songs in the series. But the CD and DVD will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment of all time.
