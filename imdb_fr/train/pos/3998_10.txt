I missed this movie when he came out and I discovered it until last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I do not remember another intimate drama that does so much. The writing is clear, realistic, nuanced and even restricted. The cinematography and editing is sober but inspired, allowing the visual narrative to dominate through wonderful close-ups and framing images, capturing loneliness and alienation in a memorable way. The acting is also wonderful, with all characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling way a film can offer. They reveal their deepest weaknesses with unprotected gross vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, as well as for the rest of the team. A must for serious moviegoers.
