Popular radio storyteller Gabriel Personne (Robin Williams, scarlet and hypnotic speaking) meets a 14-year-old Wisconsin friend, Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who has written a book detailing sexual abuse. . In addition, Pete suffers from AIDS, which further forces Gabriel, his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, well) to find himself an HIV survivor. <br /> <br /> He also gets to know Pete's tutor, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides to meet him, talk to them in person and go to Wisconsin, he discovers certain secrets that he was (naturally) not ready to discover. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by real events in Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, moves much faster (90 min, maybe a few minutes more) that one would think that a film of this kind would be broadcast. It is in this sense that the action and the scenario are clear and clear. It's a shame in that it leaves many holes in the plot and does not clog any openings in the plot or story. I would prefer not to go into the details, except to say that if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's work or personal history, you feel a little off here. Still, the performances of Williams (personally, I would have liked to know more), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and a large part of the secondary distribution (the restaurant waitress that Donna frequent at the restaurant Collete does a great job with what little part of it!) are top-notch and the established vibe here - namely, the cold, lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York - provide a terrific setting for this story. It may be that his goals do not bond well with each other, but the story remains compelling enough.
