Will Smith delivers once again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to repair his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened hearts !!! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino have come together to create a masterpiece that I highly recommend to buy and keep in your movie collection, as you'll never tire of looking / feeling that movie !!! I have the greatest respect for Will Smith because he is not only a brilliant actor, but it can be said that he has a sincere love for people and for life, which no doubt made him perfect for the character (the IRS agent Ben Thomas) that he played in this movie. You will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations aroused by his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who was also fantastic as usual. I found myself in love with the fact that their characters were falling in love. Woody Harrelson also plays in this movie Top Notch. I find it very difficult to write this review without revealing the key points of the plot ... All I can say is: "Look at it and when you make sure you have nothing to interrupt you , pick up the phone, sit down and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of IRS agent Ben Thomas ... Thank you Will Smith for another great movie !!!
