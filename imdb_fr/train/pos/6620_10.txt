If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this great movie. I just saw it a few hours ago here in Paris (where the action of the film takes place) and I can still feel the huge trauma that I received deep in my eyes ... What a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white photo and such a profound change in the way animation films are made. I firmly believe that there will be a "Renaissance" before and after, similar to what we saw with the Pixar films or the Akira and GhostInTheShell experiments. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope that this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with some young people who had a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will receive success and the recognition it deserves. Long live France !
