Famous words of Roman Maroni, owner of a foreign nightclub, this "ugly sucker" that passes all the film in the skin of the rival of Johnny Dangerously, but also massacres the English language. <br /> <br /> Another underrated classic that you can only find in the afternoon mornings or "Late Late Late Show", Johnny Dangerously is a tremendous satirical success about a boy to the good heart who secretly leads a criminal life to help pay for the medical care of his mother and to have his brother study law. <Yes, there is a story, but who cares? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner and Alan Hale Jr will make you wait to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> There are too many laughs to put here. As an airplane, you must be careful or you will miss something. Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two !!!
