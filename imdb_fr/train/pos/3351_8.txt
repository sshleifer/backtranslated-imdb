Very good western. It was the first time the writer Richard Wilson made a film. It was also a first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It's a pleasure to see a very young and pretty Angie Dickinson in the living rooms. Robert Mitchum arrives in this city dominated by the outlaws and is hired to tame the city, but people are worried about him going too far, especially for the wrongs he will do to his business. The story of "Warlock", which was made in 1959, has some similarities. This film keeps a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge of the razor.
