Oh, where are you going, my little one ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four ... <br /> <br /> I I remember these shows during their first broadcast at Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrified by Werner Van Braune's explanation of rocket science. I have seen history, science and humor mingle with a captivating story of possibilities. <br /> <br /> It was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series, and what a treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter, who at first did not even want to come into the room, but who later changed her mind when she saw that they were partially animated. Looking at her, I looked at her and at the end she was almost as absorbed as me. <br /> <br /> Go back and you're a young wife with your own babies ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive. I figured my daughter's teacher might want to show them not only a 50-year-old artefact, but also fun and easy-to-understand lessons in history. <br /> <br /> Go back, reverse, turn around and again ... you wonder how much has changed in 50 years.
