The first Visconti film has all its visual talent and immaculate technique, accompanied by the convincing performances of Massimo Girotti as a beautiful vagabond and, better still, Clara Calamai as a fabulous and frantic Giovanna. Repeatedly repeated under the title 'The Postman Rings Twice' but never improved. I can not believe it was the first movie of this man! This shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of his career.
