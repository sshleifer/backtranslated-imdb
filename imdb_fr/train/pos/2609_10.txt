I'm writing this 9 years after the last episode and I'm still shocked by the impact Wildside has had on me. <br /> <br /> It has happened where many other cop dramas have been successful. But it has gone further and does not move away from the realism of the streets, often depicting life events and characters up to a T. <br /> <br /> This series is sorely missed, we rather the stupid "Underbelly" that is dramatized and played, producing a whole lot of American waste. <br /> <br /> Wildside has remained true to the singularity of Sydney and for that I am truly indebted to this wonderful series. The acting game was A-grade and it is unfortunate that only a few actors have continued their career while others have sunk into darkness. <br /> <br /> I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of its television story. So I ask ABC to publish the complete DVD series, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
