While the story of a troubled child turning to boxing for self-respect and anger management is not a new thing, the story takes a new turn here when the protagonist is a girl at place of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. She just can not stay away from fighting. At home, her father constantly lowers her. His brother trains in boxing in a gym and one day, when he comes to pick him up, she decides that she also wants to train. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie a "Rocky with girls", I guess. But that's not what it's all about. The story benefits greatly from the fact that the main character is a girl rather than a boy. In this way, you can deal with more problems at once. First the problem of her refusal to be accepted because she is not a girl-girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she is a girl at all. It's also a story about how a goal can change someone's life. How positive things can make you grow. I do not want it to sound pretentious, because the film does not feel at all pretentious, but what I say is true. <br /> <br /> In addition, Michelle Rodriguez is very good in mind. It's a shame that she's stuck in the cast of "hard girl", because that's really not her role in "Girlfight". Of course, she's a boxer, but it's the most sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's basically an ordinary outsider story, but it's way above the crowd by Rodriguez 'performance. I note this 7/10.
