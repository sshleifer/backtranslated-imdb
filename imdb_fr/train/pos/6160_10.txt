SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I had just watched the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I would have liked them to keep the original version on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The Portabello road could have been reduced to the original length. It was too long and dragged the film. Although the dance is great, it would have been better to leave a deleted scene on the DVD. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good movie. My 5 years loved. And it's wonderful that the films I loved in my childhood are passed on to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> As I remembered! <br /> <br /> *** in **** <br /> <br />
