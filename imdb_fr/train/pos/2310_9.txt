I was so surprised by the high quality of The Man In The Moon. I meant that I was expecting a cheesy and predictable movie, but I decided to put that aside when I was watching. when it was over, I had just left Stupefied (mostly in tears), how much The Man In The Moon turned out to be. This movie is so much fun and so aware of its tone, and it's just A fabulous movie. The acting game was excellent, especially Reece Witherspoon (who was so cute and adorable) and all the others. There was nothing that really bothered me, I felt the end a little predictable, but very well done to that.Also I felt that some things were clear or as if they had been done before, but it's still a good movie. Overall, I must say that I do not have much to say about this film, not that it was bad, it's just a movie you like or do not like. I would recommend it to everything And everyone, even if you do not like this type of film, remains a nice film. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
