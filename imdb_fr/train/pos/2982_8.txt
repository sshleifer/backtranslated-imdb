I really enjoyed this movie. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time. They have the supernatural ability to add that level of nonsense to pop culture and make it ridiculous, but realistically ... if it makes sense. This is mainly what makes South Park so funny. Once you have gone beyond the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet design of all time, you see in each episode the message that is transmitted. This is seen in BASEketball. Although directed by David Zucker and completely ridiculous, it contains a heartfelt message about American companies and the shame of major sports. I'm also a sports lover, so I find this hilarious movie at times, because it's so true that people hate to love so much. The opening prologue is brilliant ... tears of laughter are forming every time I see these football players start Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it's not everyone's cup of tea ... but just like South Park, once you've gone beyond the nonsense ... there's a message really authentic that is transmitted by the genius of comics. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
