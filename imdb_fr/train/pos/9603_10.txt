I have a word on this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater were sobbing. This film shows the difficulties that Darius suffers from muscular dystrophy. The film was very well done and you were really part of the movie. The film touched me emotionally, because it reminded us that we were very lucky to be in perfect health, some people in this world are less fortified than us. And sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the end. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius an opportunity when they were not asked to do it, but they did not do it for the money they made for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know, Darius headed west.
