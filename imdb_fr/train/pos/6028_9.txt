It is in the middle of the middle period of Antonioni that most critics reject this film as an "imperfect" look at the culture and politics of the American youth of the 1960s. For what it's worth, I've found more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because he shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it serves as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations and criticisms of the American consumer culture, student life, counter-culture, and all the anti-establishment and anti-war backlash that was so important. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is a remarkably conceived film; from the wildcard opening sequence to the weird 'love-in' in the desert, to the use of billboards and up to this breathtaking cathartic final using 17 camera configurations (in its own way, as powerful as the climax of the wild group). In addition, Antonioni chose the hell of the star with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ever written. There is not a lot of "play" involved, as it sounds more like a dramatic documentary, so the use of nonprofessionals as a senior couple works quite effectively in this context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with wonderful music, its use is also impressive (I can not forget the beginning of the film, mainly because of the music selection - from Pink Floyd - who caps so well visual elements). <Contrary to popular opinion, it's quite a feat in the cinema that I would recommend enthusiastically to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the offbeat. It's worth looking for, and one of those key movies from the '60s that requires DVD restoration / output.
