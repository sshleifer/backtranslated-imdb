This film speaks of subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-changing limits of manners, interracial relationships and desire. True, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no car chases, no buildings exploding, no murders. The drama lies in the tension suggested by the looks, by minimal gestures, by spatial limits, by lighting and by things - sometimes very ostensible - not said. It's a question of identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of oneself and others, identity, desire, limits and loss. It will reward the attentive and sensitive spectator. This will displease those whose palate requires explosive action, massive and spicy. It's a beautifully filmed human story. That's all.
