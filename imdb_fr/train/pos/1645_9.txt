This western is made in a different way from most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on her ranch. The way this is presented makes it a slice of Americana of the most interesting. I would have preferred to see it on the big screen rather than on tape, but it's worth watching to see how life was back in the true west. The cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excellent in this movie.
