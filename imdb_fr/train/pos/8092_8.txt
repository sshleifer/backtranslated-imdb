I came across this film when I was 8-10 years old on a cold, dark November afternoon. I was outside playing all day, it was very cold and when I arrived around 4 pm, I had a cup of hot chocolate and sat in front of the television with a blanket. I was surprised to watch a cartoon that was neither happy nor silly - and that was dark and moralistic. This captured my imagination. I am sure the text is missing, and is abbreviated in all the bad places for the Tolkien purist. But it still captures the spirit of history, the choice to carry a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish, unthinking decisions, and so on. The quality of the animation gives way to complaints. But the only place where this film clearly surpasses the new movies is the characterization of the voice. John Hurt is excellent in this area. If you do not like the way the character is drawn, look away and just listen. His voice is extraordinary. I saw him again and again and it always brings me back to that time, child, thirsty for magical adventure. That's why I say "lucky", the film is nostalgic for me, so I neglect its flaws. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, he reaches me and reaches me again.
