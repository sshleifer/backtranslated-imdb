"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps one of my favorite campers. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, known for his splattering cartoons and slow hentai-ecchi drawings. I wish he could do more time like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the CG psychedelic scene, the scenes where Lord Helumis detonates his faulty henchmen, the party riots provoked by Bill (one of the funniest scenes) and every time that my favorite character appears, Worsle. <br /> <br /> Find out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for sophisticated Anime fans!
