Perhaps the greatest film ever devoted to jazz. <br /> <br /> It's jazz. <br /> <br /> The foreground continues to haunt my reverie. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is beautiful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a delight (see also The sound of jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the music; it is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All fans of jazz and film noir should study this wonderful jewel. <br /> <br /> What shadows and light, what music, what a hat!
