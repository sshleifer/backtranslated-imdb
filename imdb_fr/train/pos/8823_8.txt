Good movie. Tell a spooky boy story, telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what extreme measures we must take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you want to break one. If you wanted to express love for someone you do not know, how would you do it without creating an urgent social situation? In addition, it is fascism to decide the cultural life of others, what kind of culture is imposed on us. Which gives Disney or FOX or the kamikaze the right to decide what is our choice. Can not we drink morning coffee alone? Should we listen to NRJ's cries, see the stupid tabloid headlines and street commercials before we even get our morning coffee?
