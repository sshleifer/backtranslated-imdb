There is indeed much to complain about this film version of Molnar's mystical play - Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, are nauseating. It also suffers, in large part, from the fact that it is considered the first film using the rear projection. The sets look fake. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two great strengths in this show: although the dialogue readings are soft, the visual performances are perfect. Julie is not remembered today about Rose Hobart: especially for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply take pictures of her: credit the elegant visual direction of Melford. Its great beauty and simple performance (though trainee) help repair some of the damage to the earth-related sections of this film. <br /> <br /> However, one of the themes of Borzage is the mystical power of love, and it is the treatment of celestial sections that make the difference, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey of direction of the "Hot Spot". H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect. <br /> <br /> So here we have an imperfect but very interesting version. I think Lang's 1934 version is better, as are the heavenly scenes from Henry King's version of CAROUSEL, the diluted musical remake. But I have always enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance.
