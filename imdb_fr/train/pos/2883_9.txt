"Cinderella" is a film about a girl whose mother passed away and that her father remarried. Once her father died, Cinderella's mother-in-law became very mean to her and asked her to do all the household chores of the house, like cleaning up after her two evil half-sisters. One day, the king sent a message to all single women asking them to attend the royal ball in honor of his son, in order to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella could not go, but her half-sisters did it. Cinderella was very upset and thought she could not attend the royal ball until her fairy fairy appeared. So she did magic and turned Cinderella into a beautiful woman, but she was supposed to be back at midnight, because that's when the magic changed. At the royal ball, Cinderella loses the thread of time and the clock sounds midnight. She rushes out of the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the king ordered the duke to find the women who wore this slipper. The duke searched every house, but finally found the women to whom she belonged, Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske made one of Disney's best animated films in 1950. This film is a magical fairy tale. At the beginning of the movie, Cinderella was the maid of her own family and had no one to love her, but with a little magic, her whole life changed and finally found love. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about "Cinderella" is music. When Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared to be doing her magic, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing at home, so I'll never forget it. I also liked the moment when Cinderella and the Prince were singing the song So This is Love as they danced because they realized they were in love. Overall, this movie was my favorite movie when I was little because every little girl wants to live a fairy-tale life.
