Tears of Kali is an original but imperfect horror film that plunges into the actions of an Indian cult group composed of German psychologists who have learned to control their will and body to the point of being able to "heal" others by radical techniques ( can trigger nightmarish hallucinations as well as physical suffering and torture) to free the accumulated demons inside. <br /> <br /> The film is presented as a series of vignettes on the Taylor-Eriksson group - the cult group mentioned above. The first segment is a bit slower than the rest, but serves very well to lay the foundation for the rest of the film. The rest unfolds like a movie mindf @ ck with some of the basic essentials (total nudity, some gore) to make you happy. <br /> <br /> I invite you to check. Maybe not spectacular, but it's concept is pretty good and it delivers in the right places. 8/10.
