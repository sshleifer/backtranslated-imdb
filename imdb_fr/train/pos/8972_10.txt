My discovery of Jan Svankmajer's cinema opened my eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Jirí Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the most beautiful and technically most impressive animated films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> A potter wakes up and sprinkles his plant. Then he will make a pot. But enters the huge hand that crushes the pot and asks the potter to make a statue. He throws his hand, but soon, she comes back and locks him in a birdcage where he is obliged to carve a stone hand. He leaves, fainting with exhaustion, but finally finishes the task. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful sequence of metacinemas, the potter uses a candle to burn his puppet strings, escapes home. He locks himself up and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is a pure animation, unlike modern films that strive to be realistic (why?) The hand, for example, is clearly the hand of someone in a glove. All the rest is clay. The strings are visible and part of the story, making it a precursor of the movie Strings. The atmosphere is mysterious: this hand after the little potter managed to insult me ​​more horror than many horror movies put together. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity. It is a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny that can only win the hearts and minds of anyone who considers freedom as a natural right.
