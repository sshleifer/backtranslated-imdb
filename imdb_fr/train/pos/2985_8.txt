This film, one of the oldest and best international films in film opera in the world, was intended to make it more accessible to the masses. And he managed to do it admirably. The general public would not linger over a love story about two young exotic lovers of ancient Egypt if it were played by the typical tenor and a soprano weighing over 40 kilos with the vocal tract to sing properly this glorious music. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful directors (a young Loren, the beautiful Della Marra and a slender Mrs. Maxwell) that makes the story much more believable, thus giving those who are not familiar with the plot or music a better chance to be wooed. beautiful tunes that otherwise could not be. In summary, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing it when I was in high school and it certainly aroused my interest in opera, a form I did not know well at the time. I always consider this film with affection and would strongly recommend it to those who could enjoy good music with above average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was outstanding as a Radam, and unfortunately for the public does not appear in any other film.
