Initially, I marked Sarah's show with a nice big 8, but I struggled a little with his humor lately and a meager 7 is what has been settled. I will explain to you. or not. If you do not do it, I doubt that anyone can convince you. You know who you are and everything is fine, but you know it too. Then, the first season gave us fantastic information about Sarah, her friends and family, as well as about her activities in life. In a memorable episode, she is "arrested" by Agent Jay, whom she meets for the first time. - "Do you know why I'm standing here?" he asks. "Because you have all the C in high school?" she answers questioningly. It seemed like a real question. - It's funny in my book. Sarah can come to you from strange angles. In another episode, his affair with God was particularly funny. God being small and jealous added wonderfully to the joke. It's clever, it's a twisted view, but it showed us the truth with humor and we laughed. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. Although we are still not without a new and inventive comedy, we seem to have slipped into banal jokes of shit and farts, quite simply. I laugh a little here and there, but it looks a lot like a load while she herself, as well as the writers, struggle to get original material. The feelings I have for the episodes lately are horrendous and sophomoric, but I suffered the gems I found (the turtle) and I was waiting for it to return. I was a fan of her "Jesus is Magic" routine and I would like to think that I understand what she is capable of. Let's go back to that.
