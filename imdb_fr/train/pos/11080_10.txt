First, when people hear "GUY RITCHIE", they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new frontiers. This REVOLVER movie is different from snatch; it's a lot darker and very complex. The reason I gave a rating of 10 is because I had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie plays with your head. It's very intelligently written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. This was done wonderfully, the cinematography is beautiful and you can recognize the personal touch (the style) of Guy Ritchie. <br /> <br /> What seduced me is the complexity of the protagonist and the way we find ourselves more questions than answers.
