This obscure Sica delivers the goods. And it is said, "The meek shall inherit the earth." This story of course on the surface, but really an allegory for all homeless people who populated Europe after the Great War. They are homeless but happy, in societies too poor and selfish to take care of or recognize them, carpets for Italian carpets. de Sica chooses to tell it like a fairy tale, a story of Cinderella. I have not read the book on which it is based, so I can not predict if the deus ex machina is the construction of the writer or Vittorio. He begins with the words "Once upon a time ..." to illustrate the timelessness of his story, as the story could unfold anywhere and everywhere. Caricature drawings of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, the whimsical nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to grant their wishes and put an end to an image of Spielberg, make this bakery a pleasure for all. The most accessible photo of De Sica is also one of his best. Abandoning neo-realism, he has always sailed between this and the good old film, he creates a film that breaks the heart and at the same time fulfills the desire for hope that we need to continue from this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
