This is a fairly old and obsolete adventure thread. I understand that, according to current political standards, the treatment of Indians was unacceptable. But this move is not about politics. It's about action, dialogue, camaraderie, acting, direction, music and photography, and it's wonderful about all of these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electric together and Jaffe is superb. It's the ultimate boyfriend movie.
