*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Adam Hope, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-written story and a film together, Brosnan has never been as successful as his film "Bond". After 2004, "After the sunset", his new role brings good mood and good time. Professional hit man, so to speak, Julian Noble, who works for a job in Mexico City, ends up meeting the opposite, a very fashionable businessman, Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best roles ), also working there. The two on-screen duets produce a comic riot, laden with laughter and fail. Davis in one of his best roles since "American Splendor" gives another charming and witty performance. One of the most enjoyable and best movies of the year. My final grade 9/10
