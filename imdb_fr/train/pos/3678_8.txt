it is a very beautiful film and I would recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 points less: - the level of stories has a broad spectrum. some scenes are very beautiful and others boring. - many stories are not autonomous (if you compare to coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a typing line or as you want to call it) but hey, most stories are really good, some are great and overall, it's certainly one of the best movies of this year! <br /> <br /> boring, I have to fill at least 10 lines, I have nothing else to say and I do not want to start analyzing the simple sequences ... <br /> <br /> well I think that's it!
