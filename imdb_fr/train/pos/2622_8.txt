Everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've never seen anything like it, so it was crazy! Of course it's a good thing. It's a fun comedy movie, and my absolute favorite thing is how they mix other things into one! Like a little chicken, the fish posing as King Kong and Runt the pig saying: "Beauty was the one that killed the beast" scene of the war of the worlds and more. The Walt Disney Company has NOT lost the hand, maybe not for this one. Also, how they looked like they were watching a movie and it was like a home theater. <br /> <br /> However, some parts are not suitable. As in the original lion king, were not Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he defeated Scar? In this movie, they are not! they were fighting hyenas behind the scenes. The reason why Pumbaa is not so confident is because he has been repelled by other animals and is only Timon, Timon, Timon. Does anyone realize that only Timonn's story was told, while pumbaa only had flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But other than that, IT'S GREAT!
