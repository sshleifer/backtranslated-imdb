I absolutely loved this movie when I was a child. I cried every time I looked at him. It was not strange for me. I totally identified with the characters. I would love to see him again (and I hope I'm not disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really attracted to the fantastic world. And for me, the movie was loooong. I wonder if I have already seen the series and if I confused them? The game I thought was strong. I liked Jack Wilde. He was so dreamy until he was 10 years old (when I first saw the movie, not in 1970. I still remember the characters very well, the flute was totally believable and I could still feel "Wicked woods." Witchy poo was scary - I would not want to cross his path.
