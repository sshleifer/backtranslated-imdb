This film should be viewed by all librarians or potential librarians. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. The argument public library versus academic argument is a classic argument of librarians and students in library science. It also breaks many stereotypes of librarian. Librarians might even be able to have fun - even if they * do * not * have sex in the Romance Language section! (The best librarian movie? Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
