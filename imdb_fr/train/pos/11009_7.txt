The director Vincenzo Natali had an elegant approach to this film, with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu take on lead roles and expand their range of performers. This film also included one of the most imaginative "escape scenes" of recent years. The efforts of the director and the actors combined to form an effective thriller. <br /> <br /> Although the movie's storyline was complicated, the story clearly progressed as corporate layers of greed and corporate skullduggery came to light. <BR /> <br /> In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel "1984" that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state, which would control the spirits and reduce human freedom. It was interesting to note that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the state, but the business world that controlled and devalued the human worker.
