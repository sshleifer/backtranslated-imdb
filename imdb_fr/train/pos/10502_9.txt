One of the funniest fun I have ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls and good graphics for his time. there are also a multitude of bosses and crazy enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you leave out some of the challenging levels and still need more accomplishment to fight a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the angle of the camera; although it works pretty well most of the time, it can be painful in some situations. if you are a big fan of mario; this one is for you. Even if you are not a big fan of him, I would still recommend this one. It's a great game and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. good to play in short bursts of time. that will almost certainly hold your interest; it really holds mine!
