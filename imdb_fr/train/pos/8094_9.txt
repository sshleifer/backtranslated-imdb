First of all, no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with a master's writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION perfectly synthesizes the world of Tolkien with the psychedelism, the aesthetics and the liberal culture of the 1970s. Yes, the animation and the painting of background are sometimes a little "rough" in their technical execution, but it is still beautiful, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each scene. Beyond absolute uniqueness in imagery, there is absolutely exceptional dubbing - a behavior that is far superior to playing in new live action movies. And although cell animation may not be the most "technically effective" animation, it superbly captures the body and facial expressive gestures of the actors' play while not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. Background paintings vary from the traditional "fantasy" motif to pure abstraction, but the transition to abstract settings is always motivated by narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you are a person who needs to have an exhaustive computer rendering in a movie so that everything is visualized, I can see how you might not like this movie, but if you like top acting acting, transcendental imaging and JRR Tolkien, so this film is to see absolutely.
