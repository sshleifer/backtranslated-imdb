I like this film. It is well written and played and has a good cinematography. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with superb scenery and superb shots. Watch it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and Murphy does his job particularly well in describing the unwilling / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I've been concerned about what happened to these people and, although the result is quite predictable (the good ones are winning, the hero gets the surprisingly attractive girl and the holy child are saving lives - that do not see that coming?), it always made me happy when everything worked out in the end. Thank God, the dignity of this film has never been spoiled by a series of crap. Grab some popcorn, curl up on the couch and watch this fun, happy and entertaining movie.
