It is a very rare film and probably the least known of Shirley Temple, because it does not appear in any of its collections. The reason is probably because he has no happy ending, unlike all his other films. Although she sings a song called "The world owes my life". The film was shot in 1934 and was originally in black and white, the version I have is in color and VHS, I would say they did a great job because the color seems realistic, unlike this that I would say Laurel And Hardy colorized movies that are terrible.The film is good for his age and the story has not dated at all, I am surprised that no one has tried to Make a remake sometimes. Sometimes the film is a little too talkative, some scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really lost. Some scenes seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five minutes. Do not be put off by this, because this film contains really good moments, especially when {Jerry} Ga ry Cooper steals a necklace and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear.The tension and slowness increase what he does {while his daughter sings at the same time in front of an audience in another room} is very well directed.Gary and Caroles edgy the facial expressions when examined are also very good.In short, it is a good film of the early 30s, accept it for his age.
