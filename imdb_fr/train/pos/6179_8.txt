It is good to see that Vintage Film Buff has correctly classified his excellent DVD as a "musical" because that's what this movie is, pure and simple. As for his unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), the assassination plot is just a pretext for a complex women's show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of super-decorative, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian. Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also present to lend his powerful voice to "Cocktails for Two". Without doubt the most popular song of the film, it is heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael who steals the show, not only with her rendition of "Sweet Marijauna", but also with her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend. For the rest of the cast, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his weak running gag with his cult icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is too complicated and overworked, the ultra-stupid inspector McLaglen just can not get his hands on the killer even though, you believe, in this case, he happens to be the person you suspect the most. The director Mitch Leisen actually tries to show the murderer even to the most stupid of the spectators of the cinema by giving the concerned player close-up after close-up.
