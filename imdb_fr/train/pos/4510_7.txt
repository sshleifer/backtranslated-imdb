Stressing that Martin Luther King's inspiring spirit lies not only in American civil liberties, but also in people's hearts and minds, Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev transplanted this belief into a 1969 Danish college. More specifically, he enters the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his director Svendsen (Bent Mejding), oppressively rigid and severely abusive. Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with a certain aplomb and a refreshing command on its varied characters keeps it catchy. A battle of ideologies between an insane and 13-year-old disciplinarian gives way to the inherent humor, but awkward changes in mood disorders while keeping it cunningly cynical in the same spirit as a "Society of dead poets "more than a" Matilda ". He follows a familiar path, but a continuous and accurate service to his young protagonist, including a personal plot that completes Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to turn the film into an exciting family film, the right nose on money.
