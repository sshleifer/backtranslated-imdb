THE RUNNING MAN, with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite film of Schwarzenegger. No, it's not 2001, but it's not supposed to be. And the acting and the screenplay here do not even live up to Arnie's other films like PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I submit that the idea behind this film is one of the coolest ever seen on the big screen. A state-sponsored televised game in which criminals convicted of serious crimes fight against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (runners do not have them) to satisfy the desire for sport and blood of the public. The ultimate prize for a winning runner: freedom. This is what the rules claim. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such bloody and ridiculous death scenes, this movie has a lot to say. Someone else has commented on all the culture / government comments in this film, so I will not go into detail here. Suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly stupid aspect of the film, you will appreciate it a lot (especially if you are a big fan of SF with a lot of imagination). As I said, it's not a serious art film, but it's amazingly superimposed on a 1980s shoot-em-up film. The principle is borrowed from a Richard Bachman novel ( alias Stephen King), but it differs quite strongly from its sources, especially towards the end. (The book ends rather nihilistically, needless to say, this movie is not.) I enjoyed both, but I like the movie better. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: "Suppose this is due to steroids."
