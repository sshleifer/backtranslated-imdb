"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that has been proclaimed a masterpiece for good reason - it's really one of the best movies ever made in America. Its at once artistically valid but fully accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success on his first outing. But be warned, this is also one of the most heartbreaking movies ever made.

That is why I cherished the years from 1967 to 1977 for American cinema.
