One of the best political satires I have ever seen so far, with excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent scenario, very well placed and very good unexpected. twist at the end. The action scenes were well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, I look up at this film. He is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East and, as such, he may receive bad criticism from people who do not share the same political point of view, or people who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate black and hard humor. Indeed, in some places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was at the limit between funny and tragic.
