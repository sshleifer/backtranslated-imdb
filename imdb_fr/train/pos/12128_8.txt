I just saw "Of Human Bondage" for the first time a few days ago and WOW! What a mysterious and almost scary movie. I liked the way the music was changing at the pace of every step of Philip's feet. It gave me chills for some reason ... <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is that you can see Bette Davis go straight into your eyes. She's great, not necessarily because it's her best work, but because it was so unusual to be so vicious, serious and unyielding as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was a risk taker, wanting it's still true when she began to realize that she could be as mean and bold as she wanted and that people would love her for that. If you're a true movie lover, it's amazing to see ... <br /> <br /> She just had a way to deliver a line that made her role. Like "A mass of music and fire, it's me ... an old kazoo and some sparks" or "But you're Blanche, you're in this chair!" or "WITH ALL MY HEART, I ALWAYS LOVE THE MAN I KILLED !!" ... These are some of his films, but you understand my drift. She was so brave, impertinent and exotic with those beautiful big eyes. After seeing this, I can not believe it was redone twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent, she needs to be loved. I thought he was adorable and did not understand that everyone was not crying for him, but again, everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was something common with the writing of the first films. They would make such a hateful character that it's almost unbelievable that someone will fall in love with them. The performances were excellent, but in real life, Philip would never have been interested in Mildred. It's just the simple truth ... See it !!
