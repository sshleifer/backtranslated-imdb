Talk about a dream casting - two of the most wonderful actors ever - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - in "Hot Millions," a funny and offbeat comedy starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-embezzlement who retrieves the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and holds a position in a Malden-run company, with the aim of diverting funds. It is not a smooth navigation; he has attracted the attention of his competitor to the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor Maggie Smith (who knows him at home under their other place of residence), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can not keep work and she is seen throughout the film in various jobs - all ending in her dismissal. When Newhart makes her advances, she invites Ustinov to his apartment for the curry as a camouflage, but the two men soon decide that they are made for each other. Of course, she does not know that Ustinov is a crook. <br /> <br /> It's such a good movie. You can not help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius and the ways in which he slips out of trouble. But there is an end that will show you who really has the brain. Do not miss this film that takes place in the 60s in London. It's worth it to hear Maggie Smith complain, "I got fired."
