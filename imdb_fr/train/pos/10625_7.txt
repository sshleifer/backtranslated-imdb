"One minute hate" is arguably one of the best films to come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say it's a brilliant film, but it's definitely worth watching. <br /> "Hate" tells the sordid adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), a formerly abused child. and begins to listen to his evil side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very pleasant visually. The plans are creative and the lighting is generally gloomy and interesting to watch. This film is actually a valuable piece of production, unlike other recent releases in Michigan, such as "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies". Subtle dolly shots and a stylized composition illustrate the judicious use of this film's $ 350,000 budget. <br /> <br /> However, "Hatred" stumbles in the same places as many other local movies, namely in the history and characters department. . Essentially, things go as if nothing had happened. Eric Seaver does not evolve at all. Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to realize it. The film walks happily with very little development. Moreover, the end is very abrupt. <br /> <br /> However, since this is a horror movie, since when are we interested in the plot? We only want people to die and "Hatred" keeps its promises. As the death toll increased, theater people began to applaud "Kill her, kill them all!" When people are screaming on the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is the place where "Hate" succeeds. It's funny. And finally, that's all that really matters.
