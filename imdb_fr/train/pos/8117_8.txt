I first saw this film 40 years ago on North American television and thought it was a depressing look at the future. Wells considers the restriction of private freedoms as a good thing. ("no private airplanes") This film was not shown to British moviegoers in war, it is the war that lasted more than 30 years in the film The concept of the future and the concept of Korda an Co. Future machines are the real stars of the film The best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as Boss, a combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the comedy series Absolutely Fabulous It is interesting to note that the Boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to the Churchill wartime.
