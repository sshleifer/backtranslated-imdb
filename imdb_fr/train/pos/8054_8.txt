"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial art movies I've ever seen. Sammo Hung describes a Chinese farm boy who comes to visit a friend in the city. Just like Tang Lung of "Way of the Dragon". Wherever Sammo goes, trouble begins, so he must rely on his martial arts skills to resolve disputes. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He strokes his nose with his thumb just as Bruce Lee does, and also shrieks. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a big Bruce Lee. There is a big confrontation towards the end of the film which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo must meet each opponent one by one. A bit like "The Game of Death", where each fighter has a different martial arts discipline. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I saw. Excellent fight scenes and lots of laughs. A rare and classic film by Sammo Hung that I highly recommend to all martial art lovers. 8.5 / 10!
