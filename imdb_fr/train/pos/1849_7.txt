"Antwone Fisher" tells the story of a young black US Navy man enrolled in the abuse and neglect of his childhood (Luke), whose hostility to others earned him a pass with the basic psychologist (Washington) ), leading to introspection, self-evaluation and roots. Pat, disinfected and sentimental, "Antwone Fisher" is a film of well-being on the reconciliation of past regret and closure. A good old-fashioned Hollywood-style entertainment enhances entertainment with just a hint of corn. (B)
