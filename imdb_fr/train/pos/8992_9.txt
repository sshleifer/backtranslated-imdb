A really cool movie. A must for any music snob. You do not really need to know the bands to enjoy the movie. Before the movie, I had only heard two songs from the Dandy Warhols. The only thing needed is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The Dandy Warhols play a role in the film as a "rival group", but they are the second violin of the BJM. The Dandy Warhols do not play in the film as important as I had supposed, but they did not have the excitement and unpredictability of the BJM. You can not help but be fascinated by the band. . and his very charismatic leader, Anton Newcombe. In itself, it is an insightful film and a study of the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy it.
