I saw the trailer of this movie in the 70s when I was just 16 when I was watching another movie. Oh!!!! how excited me and my best friend were. we could not wait a month or two until that happened. I saw this film 17 times this year at the theater. I love J'adore J'adore. Kris is so perfect for the movie. He is impetuous and a little trashy, but also shy and uncertain with Babs and he is so endearing to watch him again. When they sing evergreen in the studio and it resonates with its hoarse voice so different from the perfect notes that come from it, I always thought it was one of the best scenes of the movie. The way he looks at her and he is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress up as if nothing had happened. I even have a long sweater and a cap that looked so much like the one she wore. It came on TV on time and I forced my girls to watch it, they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it's just that I was so trapped at an age when everything was extreme, I do not know. The end always tears me even today.
