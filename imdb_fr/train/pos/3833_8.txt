I can not believe that others have had such a serious vision of all this. God, it was very fun to root for Cassidy. It was a great tribute to Western series of years ago. It was not supposed to be a great cinema experience, except that it was. So what happens if there is not a great manna of special effects. It was fun, tongue in cheek, look at the old Western. Man, relax and enjoy.
