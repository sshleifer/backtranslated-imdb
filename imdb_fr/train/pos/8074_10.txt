Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in the 1920s in Ireland, Gypo and his Irish compatriots are part of a clandestine rebellion against the oppressive British. A rebel, wanted for murder by the English, returns secretly to the city. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the Â£ 20 reward proves too tempting. Gypo has his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Right away, Gypo, with money burning a hole in his pocket, is their prime suspect, but they, who are his friends, do not want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simple in its plot, but complex in its moral and emotional problems. It's easily one of John Ford's most emotional movies. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his sorry nature and arouse a lot of sympathy for him. The scenario is also very suspenseful. This is the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure to know how everything will go. So we have to clench our teeth and continue to bear it. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who has starred in many of Ford's films, has probably given his best performance here (and won an Oscar for that). Every other artist in the film deserves congratulations. The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionist films. I like the dark side of Ford. In his mood, as well as in his themes, The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford movies, The Long Travel Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); it is also somewhat similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940) in this respect. 10/10.
