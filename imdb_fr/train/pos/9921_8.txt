I've been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work for years and it was a pleasure to see the man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The harsh beauty of the shipyard in Bangladesh, the stone quarry in Vermont, the huge assembly plant in China, the old beleaguered neighborhoods of Shanghai just waiting to be demolished: these landscapes are so well captured by the photographer the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I was thinking about old TV documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic molding plants; the kind of things I grew up watching. Burtynsky's work has the great value of showing that industrial activity has only moved to Asia, it has not stopped. The strangest scene for me was the computer break somewhere in China - the waste looked threatening, while the workers were very jovial.
