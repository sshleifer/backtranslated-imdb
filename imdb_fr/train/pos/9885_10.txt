Young Erendira and her tyrannical grandmother offer a great fantasy of the new world. This interpretation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, "The incredible story of the story of Erendira, ..." can not rub the purists of Marquez, even if the story remains intact and retains all the strength of the work. The strength of this film lies in his acting, especially Papas as a grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez novices will appreciate this film for its true brand of spirit.
