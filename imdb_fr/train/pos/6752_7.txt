A detective (Dana Andrews) known for his violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to hide it. The film directed by Otto Preminger has a lot of atmosphere, but the story is diluted when the wife of the deceased (Gene Tierney) falls in love with Andrews. He was doing pretty well in a big hole, but it was too bright at the end of the tunnel for a film noir. Gary Merrill is terrific as Scalese, a crime chief whose demolition obsesses Andrews, and the tension between them gives the film its energy and dynamism, especially a scene in a bath with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the night appointment outside the Bellevue Hospital, this sets up what should have been the conclusion of the film. Excellent notes for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... and the general representation of the underground world, although the angle of love and the simplistic elements of the good cops do not favor its cause.
