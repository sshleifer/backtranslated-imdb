A nice surprise! I was expecting further degradation along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped movie. This may be the reason why so few people have approved this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Shrewd dialogue instead of bright simple lines, decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the hunt has arrived, you are really thirsty. Fanboys expecting a roller coaster of Armageddon: stay away. This is one for smarter action fans. It did not even bother me Pretty appeared so little.
