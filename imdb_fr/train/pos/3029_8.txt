The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; for example, the calm but sinister humor that comes into play with Boyer and Lorre, or the obsession of the murdered child who takes over part of the plot. Where the film departs from the novel, it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> However, I do not mean that the film is bad in any way. It always looks like the party and the story stays in the spirit like a good one. Some of the minor characters were stock actors who could do anything. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the film is not available on DVD.
