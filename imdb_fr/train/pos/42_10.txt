Busy Phillips performed a comical and dramatic performance. Erika Christensen was good but Busy stole the show. It was a good idea after The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which was not terrible. If Busy does not receive any applications of any kind for this film, it would be a disaster. Forget about Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.
