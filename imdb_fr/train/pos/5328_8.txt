I still remember seeing this on TV. I could not believe that TVNZ lets him do it! I had to own it! A lot of humor will be lost for non-NZ'ers, but try it! <br /> <br /> Since they finished the back of the Y series, Matt and Chris have moved on to bigger and better things (?). Randy Campbell, New Zealand's greatest stuntman, has appeared on the British television series Balls of Steel. Yes, he continues to do all his acrobatics because he is too drunk. <br /> <br /> The house band Deja Voodoo also released two albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band is made up of members of the Back of the Y team and singles such as "I would give you one of my beers (but only have 6)" and "You were not even born in the 80's "continue their humor. <br /> <br /> The South-By-Southwest Film Festival also presented its feature film "The Devil Made Me", which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> All up, if you can not find these funny guys then you can just F% ^ K OFF !!
