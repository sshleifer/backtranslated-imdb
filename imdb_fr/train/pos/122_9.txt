I had begun to lose faith in recent movies that had been inundated with the typical Hollywood film. The scenarios fail and the camera work is simply copied from the last film of similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europa) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical narrative is not only captivating, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you on a fascinating journey at every step and takes you into Europa 1945. We've all seen death exposed on the screen in a hundred thousand ways, but the beauty of this film is its every moment slow that leads you to death. Unlike many movies, it's not enough for a second to show (for example) a knife, but forces you to look at the devastating and sensual beauty of a man's last moments. I think we can all take something different from what this movie is trying to say, but it's really worth taking the time to find out what it really means. I would like to talk more about the movie for anyone who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
