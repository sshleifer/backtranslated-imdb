It needed absolutely some work in season 2. Like the Virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White with his old, great cult. During season two, however, the only thing that made me look was to see if Max and Logan would ever get rid of the ugly virus that was infecting Max. Very good drama in season two. But of course, as in all television programs, if there is something wrong, the broadcasting company interrupts it. I was seriously hoping for a third and final season. Season 2 leaves you hanging, unless you read Max Allan Collins' books, you'll know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel should be on the air for one more season although it could cost a lot just to get all the original actors back. from the skies of Jessica Alba's career has skyrocketed after the show. If this is the case, there should be a movie to complete it. just like the Firefly series, which of course was canceled by FOX.
