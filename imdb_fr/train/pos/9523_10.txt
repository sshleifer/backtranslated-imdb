I loved this film! I am a real fan of Tom Hanks and I have always been impressed by all his work. From his most dramatic roles like Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 & Philadelphia. To his hilarious roles as A League Apart, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big & of course, Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only big actor to illuminate the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, a rising star who is very promising in the role of Hanks son in Hollywood and delivers nothing less than an excellent performance. He is certainly someone to watch over his career, I think he will do great things. Paul Newman, as always, offers a brilliant performance on the screen. He is really a legend. We can not forget the people who did not play such an important role in the film, but who still contributed to its success. The beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays in Bastard Out of Carolina and Single White Female that I'll never forget, brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the movie and does a superb job. Liam Aiken is another treasure found in the movie. He does such a good job with such a small role and, just like his roles in Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I Dreamed Of Africa, he gives an excellent performance.
