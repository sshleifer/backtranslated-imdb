This movie has one of the most cheesy plots I've seen. For me, that's what makes it so great! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they did in the original Munsters series. Although there was less burlesque, they still worked together wonderfully "comically". I hope Yvonne de Carlo, like Lily, would have had more involvement in the plot. She showed that she could do comedy in the original series, but it was mostly wasted in this movie. This film also stars the great Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think a better job could have come out of it.
