Because of all the negative reviews of this movie, I almost did not watch it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that this is a pretty nice horror movie. The acting was not great - aside from the wonderful Alice Krige - but some dialogues ("Consider yourself a lunch.") Were pretty entertaining. <br /> <br /> Overall, Stephen King's effort is above average - 7/10.
