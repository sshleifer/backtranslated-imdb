Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, Pickup on South Street is a difficult, brutal and well-made film on a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently acquires a top secret microfilm and becomes a target for spy agents . Jean Peters is also involved as a big tough guy who is used as a courier by his ex-devilish lover Richard Kiley. It's a black film at its best and although the performances are very good, its great actress Thelma Ritter, who steals the film. As Moe, an exhausted street peddler selling neckties (and also selling information), she is great in a role that earned her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for an Academy Award and has never won. That should have been the part that played for her!
