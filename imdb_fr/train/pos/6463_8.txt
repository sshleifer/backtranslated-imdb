This is one of those movies you continually think about when you wake up the next morning. This will give you a feeling of warmth and blur and leave you a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Of course, we are fed characters and typical stereotypical stories, but that's not the problem: entertaining. <Br /> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the United States for a while, the way we react is funny. "The husband who lost his life will kill him", "She (Gabriella) will die and there will be a heartbreaking end larger than life". We know how these things work, everything ends up coming together. And that did it. The characters were a bit simple, they were so elaborate that you did not really think about it, there was nothing left for your own imagination. The closest one would probably be Siv, she makes you wonder if she really was in love with Daniel, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautiful, taking place in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely fantastic. and the characters are adorable. Michael Nyqvist is truly a genius, with his unique and crazy look and Frida Hallberg is charming and affordable. Maybe a little too well. <br /> <br /> But above all, this film makes you feel, and that's the most important thing. You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify. I do not know about you guys, but it does not happen often.
