If television was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With excellent distribution and a perfect plot, this show has given 8 incredible seasons and great joy for television after dinner. With the constant change of relationships and the discovery of the true father of Hyde, this show was a success in its debut in August 1998, although it was scheduled in 1976. Spending time in the basement of Foremans was always what to do at the time. and that's still the case today, with the circles. This show was a good laugh at first and it still makes it during the reruns. If you watch some episodes of this show, you will get everything and want to have more. Now only this show is one of the best ever created, it's smart and fun.
