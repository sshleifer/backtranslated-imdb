First of all, consider that this film is almost fifty years old! Still, it remains one of the greatest movies of all time. I'm wondering how many of today's disposable celluloid productions will still be discussed in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but strong enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. I still remember the first time I watched that, child, when the monster entered the force field protecting the ship and you had to see its outline for the first (and only) time. If I was shaking with fear, I can tell you. A look dated today, but still more than enough. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger show their age now. You can see the outline where the tiger has been nested in the shots with Altaira, but they are only visible. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the effect by which the creature makes its way through the gates of Krell is wonderfully realized. <It's also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (best remembered for Airplane and Naked Gun films) as a young man, but still mature. He was 30 when this movie was released! Nearly 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie that will definitely continue to be a favorite for years to come. Timeless.
