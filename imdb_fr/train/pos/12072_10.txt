What if Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy met in a night of breathtaking relativity? <br /> <br /> This charming key novel never uses the real names of the characters so finely. veils and scathing exposes not only to the individuals they had to be, but also to what they ended up representing. If you are confused by allegory, or if you like your movies served predators and pasty, you will not like this movie. It is a demanding opus that rewards the viewer with the intelligence of appreciating it on several levels. <br /> <br /> Abandoning for the moment the rigorous avoidance of the use of the real names of the characters, we see Einstein, about to give a pacifist speech before a UN dictator for nuclear weapons, visited by Marylin Monroe, after filming the infamous Seven Year Itch scene that would have led to the end of her marriage with Joe Dimaggio. Einstein stumbles with an appropriate professional clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sexual symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a red. He is determined to secure Einstein's assurance that he will support the activities of the House's Committee on American Activities while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person, perhaps not perfectly interpreted by Gary Busey, who hates Marilyn's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein became his lover, even if Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the theory of special relativity. <br /> <br /> But there is more. <br /> <br /> Like all of us, these characters have their deepest fears, which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks. It is these weaknesses, ultimately, that lend humanity figures that we can not help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision and the statement of the film becomes clear. It's a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Insignificance is one of my five best movies of all time. It's absolutely incredible.
