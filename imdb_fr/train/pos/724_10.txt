The film is just fun ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and who are fans of "The Ramones" around the time the film was shot. I watched the movie again and again, alone and with friends, and it's still fresh and fun. At the risk of being too serious, the idea of ​​becoming a big fan of a certain group is timeless, and high school students bothered by the tedious work of certain classes are just as much. <br /> <br /> And the movie has some lines of gems / scenes ..... references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us throughout life. (Let me assure you that I've been out of high school since, uhhh, a few years and that it does not follow me) ..... the famous line "static" ("I get static" ..... "Not as much as you're going to get", approaching the main Togar) ... the school board member who is so decrepit that he's being followed by nurses ... the Nazi monitor is watching the love of a "body search" ...... The main Togar announcing "I give you the final solution" and burning Ramones records (note: the records were the ones that preceded the CDs) ... and of course Joey Ramone noting that "things have changed a lot since we were fired from high school", followed by Togar who asks "Do your parents know you are Ramones?" <br /> <br /> Just a tip, do not look where the stars are now ..... Joey Ramone unfortunately died young. Dey Young, who was a star of the movie, reminds us today that we are all getting older ... PJ Soles' career has never been as advanced as expected ... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students, apparently only appeared in this movie (one of my male friends dies every time we watch the movie), but I think his performance was more than enough and should have brought him more teen movie roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, look and have fun ..... do not think ... have fun!
