CitizenX (1995) is the response of the developing world to Silence of the Lambs. Where "silence" terrorizes our peace of mind, the "citizen" exhausts and saddens us instead. This dramatization of the Chikatilo affair translates rather well into a Westernized friendship between two cops from Rostov who have become equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also argue against (!) The death penalty far better than the life of Kevin Spacey David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> The human is a Machiavellian mammal under which lies the limbic brain (logic of the lizard). Why did two children who knew better, kill an infant that they kidnapped? Why did the bloodthirsty women shout "li-lilililililii" as a result of OBSCENE acts of terrorism? -My own term for this is "limbic domination", the logical need of lizard to dominate an "enemy". If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in your vocabulary, you are easily able to "limbic dominance". <br /> <br /> In the 1980s devastated by the Second World War, Rostov (located at the mouth of the Don near the Black Sea), nothing has stifled the desire for "limbic domination" of Andrei Chikatilo to master his layers of civilization. The easy victims of Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) are poor, usually children, who take the intercity train for pleasure, to the extent that they can not afford anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the denial of a soviet frantic bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 of these "lambs". The serial killer of Rostov roamed free for nearly 7 years AFTER the arrest and release of the police. <br /> <br /> The politicization of the repression of crimes is detrimental to police forces around the world. Although police forces routinely suffer from corruption around the world, in the west, politicians seize the voices to create chronic rivalries between agencies, preventing a more coordinated response to crime. In CitizenX's Soviet Union, however, the murder department of Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) suffered from a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn plays the role of Chikatilo, psychically inadequate, with irreproachable but minimized authority - no point of complete darkness. In real life too, Chikatilo has had an experience of a lifetime, mixing and avoiding capture. <br /> <br /> His pursuer, however, stands out as a strange bird, subject to naive and unannounced explosions. Perhaps on purpose, Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as chief of the Burakov science police. Rea's Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is devoid of humor and sullen, which contradicts everyone. <br /> <br /> So it is Donald Sutherland who leaves with the photo. Colonel Fetisov of Sutherland, the leader of Burakov, and initially his only support, is a patient militia, too restrained, whose dignified conduct bears witness to decades of bureaucratic machinations. His awakening as a cop inspired by logic but always passionate becomes the fundamental idealism of the film. <br /> <br /> Joss Ackland makes another twist as a vicious appararatchik, secretary of the Bondarchuk Communist ideology, overseeing the investigation. Naturally, he canceled the arrest of the most likely suspect, a communist, in 1984, a man carrying a rope and knife in his bag, supposedly returned home: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> Soon, he replaced Burakov by detective Gorbounov (John Wood), another apparatch from Moscow, insists that the investigation now focuses on "known homosexuals". The funniest scene of this sad and sad film is set during the institutionalized harassment of Bondarchuk and Gorbunov: a stupid policeman eagerly reports: 'As I suspected, comrade is fornication. I made drawings - screaming laughs. <br /> <br /> Five years after the pile-up of bodies in 1987, the police finally tried to solicit criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), nicknamed the "CitizenX" of UNSUB. Later, he also observed to Fetisov and Burakov that "together, you are making a wonderful person". We agree. <br /> <br /> The extended rhythm spread over a decade perfectly reflects Glasnost's institutional inertia - "openness" - this was not the case. The contrast with Perestroika - "restructuring" - could not have been bigger for the case. Although Chikatilo was still lurking in railway stations, police plans were about to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990, Colonel Fetisov was quickly promoted to general. His arch-nemesis, Bondarchuk, disappeared from the scene, allowing the investigation to continue without political interference. Staff, communications, advertising - all of a sudden everything was available. In just one phone night, Fetisov was able to bring his team of depressed forensic jurists to the FBI serial killing group in Quantico, where, Fetisov discovers, the staff is routinely replaced by mass murder cases. to avoid any psychological damage to the investigators. /> <br /> Fetisov informs his new chief of the scientific police, now named "Colonel" Burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confessions that becomes the decisive scene of the film. Fetisov is the sweetest excuse I've ever seen in a movie: `In private, I offer my sincerest apologies to you and your wife. I hope that someday you will forgive my ignorance, "he almost whispers. <br /> <br /> A production of HBO, CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber. Not only do the exteriors look genuinely dark (shot exclusively in the most degraded parts of Budapest, spectacular), but Randy Edelman's breathtaking soundtrack is overwhelming and is often our only respite after the dark brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> <br /> The murders perpetrated by Chikatilo are described as a dark and absurd behavior, born of defects of character and ignorance in an equally dark world. This makes the murders seem not totally irrelevant, but of course they have been. As President Kennedy reminded us, "we all cherish the future of our children". <br /> <br /> CitizenX communicates perfectly that the murder is much more macabre and obscene than a fantasy of revenge suggests. Serial rapists rape to dominate; Serial killers kill to dominate. So do soldiers. Such "limbic rulers" make poor humans. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The real Andrei Chikatilo was the most prolific serial killer in the world. Found guilty, he was executed in 1992, along with all the death sentences in the Soviet Union: a shot in the head. Stupidly, such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best result is always the prevention of murders, not their pursuit. Executions simply guarantee that society does not learn from the complex reality of the death of the victims when we send even anecdotal evidence of the HOW / WHY cause of their death. The killers also do not learn to regret if they are dead. <br /> <br /> Vengeance does not cancel the victims. Committing to the blood of the murderer is nothing better than counter-domination - once it's too late. <br /> <br /> Vengeance in the name of mourning does not do justice to the deceased, it is the appeasement of the living (10). /ten)
