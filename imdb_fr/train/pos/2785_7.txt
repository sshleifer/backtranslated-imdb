"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of these 80s teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything happens in a colorful world where everyone is attractive, there are easy-to-solve conflicts that sometimes remove generally happy procedures, and vast scenes are summed up by mounts on inflatable pop tunes. Nothing wrong with that, though. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute treat from start to finish. My wife and I found ourselves totally conquered by the corn balls cheesiness even as we made fun of him, and at the end, as embarrassing as it may be to admit it, we applauded (and we got it seen from elsewhere in our room, not in a theater). Watch this movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Level: B +
