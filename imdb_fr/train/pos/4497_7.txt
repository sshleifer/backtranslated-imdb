I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted at the end of the 90s and it's only recently that I had the opportunity to watch all three parts via Netflix (practical service in B). Overall, I liked this light mini-series, sometimes challenged by the genre. The story of a younger man falling in love with an older woman seems to be walking and the actors are doing well. Yes, he has some romantic clich√©s running in the rain or farewell to a train station, but the characters have a chance to be explored, so that does not seem trivial, as it would be if it were 'a Tom Hank vehicle or similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakula, who is separated at birth, does the good work of someone who is madly in love and the back and forth of desire and rejection throws the series into the price of reading . Personally, I think that the series could have been done in two episodes, but I suppose that it must be debated. Apparently, there is a sequel, which should arrive tomorrow via Netflix.
