I think this show is incredibly funny! This is not for all tastes, and I will not raise or denigrate people who do not get it. I'm sure these are brilliant people who work at a different wavelength. But if you like it, you REALLY love it. Sarah plays a "loser" named "Sarah Silverman" who is often found in difficult Homerian situations ("Homerian" as in "Homerian Simpsonian"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman from her short Saturday Night Live concert in the early '90s. I loved her right away and I bent over backwards to check everything she had done. <br /> <br /> This show is funny, stuffy. Therefore, I always fast before watching it and I wear adult diapers. Check it out!
