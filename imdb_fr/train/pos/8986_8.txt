Anton Newcombe does the film and he is the main subject. Watching him sing a song, if not an entire album, quickly shows that this guy is a real talent. He thinks he's god, but he's so interesting and interesting. The DWs are not really interesting in comparison music or other. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton told the cameraman, "Well, let's go pay this guitar!" Excellent use of archive / video material at home. Great to see that rock docs are still being made. A nice doc on the creative process. If you like that, check out Nirvana Live! Tonight! Exhausted! on DVD. A good Anton experience is this movie. 8 out of 10
