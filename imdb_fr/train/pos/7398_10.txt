Xizao is a rare little film. It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so enriching in emotion and joy. The story is simple and the theme of the old and the new shock is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but it would have fallen to the ground without the beautiful characters and actors who describe them. <br /> <br /> The aging patriarch, Master Liu, is a relic of China's pre-expansion days. He runs a bath house in an old neighborhood. Every scene in the bathroom is a source of jelaousy for us, stressed, unhappy. Even the hardened cynics can find no fault in this beautiful setting. <br /> <br /> Er Ming, Master Liu's mentally disabled son, is the film's second most powerful character, associated with his modern brother. The interactions between these three people and the various visitors to the bathroom are incredibly detailed and palpable; some scenes are so moving that they go beyond almost anything we see in the movies. <br /> <br /> With its critical message scheme, this film has not only been censored, but has also received an unreasonably small coverage. It could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find, even on the Internet (!), You can not help but be wary. <br /> <br /> So help freedom of speech and film world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you own the DVD, if there is one, share share share!
