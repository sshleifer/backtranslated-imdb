I saw this series during its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where two men gathered and asked a director from each country to make a film about 911. These directors had never met before the end of the project. They saw what he looked like. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful and some were controversial. If you are an American, then you may not like it because some of the pieces may be found un-American. However, I know some Americans who enjoyed these series. The piece I found the best was that of India. It was the way a Muslim family living in the United States had two sons and one of them was missing. The Americans chilled their backs and automatically assumed he was linked to the terrorist attack. It reflects the mother's despair and the humiliation of these accusations, so it made me cry. In the end, we see that his son had died trying to save the many victims of the towers crash. It was a true story, and that was what made it so real. There were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was both humorous and as powerful as the others. A must for everyone and, hopefully, the United States will revoke it and let it play in their country.
