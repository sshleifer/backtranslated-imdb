Well, I was a teenager when I saw the movie ... the songs were a resounding success, but the elite class ignored govinda movies at the time, while watching govinda and karishma movies (aka karizma) was not right for this class but many people liked it when the series of these movies rocked the 90s and most of them were successful. Today, I was watching it again after a long time and I remembered it, there were a lot of people and the riot that they had created when the song appeared on the screen ... the dresses of govinda and karishma complement each other well (the worst duo of clothing of the time) and karisma in the late 90s has transformed, but govinda has always been very loyal For his designer, his sense of dress remains the same ... but at the time everything was mixed, everything was good ... everything was working and slowly, the elite class realized how much fun it was to miss and then ..... there There was no turning back for this jodi as he continued to make these indians continue series ..hated by a few but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good time with nothing to do rent or watch on TV I do not think you'll regret it ... but remember it's the worst at its best .. <br /> <br /> I watch these movies when I get time because I can not stop laughing ... that's why I say: go ahead and have a good time because there are I love stupidity and especially when it is done by the kings of their time, it is surely watchable ... I recommend it to all moviegoers ...
