I found "Time At The Top" an entertaining and stimulating experience. The acting, although generally not very brilliant, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film for the youngest, it is certainly one of the best works of its kind (Science-fiction for children). Normally, I would say that Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia produce the best children's movies and TV shows, and "Time At The Top" does nothing to override this theory! I do not think that continuity and acting are important for young people. A good plot and an imaginative scenario are much more important to them. Both are in abundance in this movie. The special effects are good, without damaging the story, nor closing the viewer with his own imagination. It would have been very easy to inject an overload of SFX into this movie, but it would have totally destroyed all of its "Reason to be". <br /> <br /> The settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this film, and complement the refined wardrobe and historical accuracy. Overall, this film is very satisfying, and I recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children, or those who try, like me! Now, I really have to read the original book as soon as possible.
