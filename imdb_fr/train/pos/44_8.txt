When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another girls movie. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message to judge others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I met, I recommended this movie to. Nobody came back saying it was bad. Busy has also done a great job with his role in this movie. I do not know much about her acting career but wow, the way she managed the end of this fill was great. At first, it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the movie resumes. I do not know why we did not talk about this film in the world of cinema. My wish is that this film be published again and announced more ... because it sends a powerful message in just an hour and a half.
