It was a good movie. It was not your typical war movie but something a little different. This film showed us recruits in training before the war and not really at war. This film is one of the most realistic views on war and the military that most other films of this genre. Colin Farrel did a great job in describing a rookie in the military. Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis have also made a satisfying contribution. To see Colin Farrel go from grade B to grade in just a few years, you never thought it would happen. I would also add that the filmmakers in Tigerland did a good job filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good idea. It is good to see the talents used wisely and I hope to see this same talent again in the near future.
