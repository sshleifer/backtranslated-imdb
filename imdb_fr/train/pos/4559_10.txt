My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her 22 years of existence, she has only seen the walls of our house and her school, which is also occupied by other children with disabilities. I have been the target of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled and I still think so far that no one cares or cares about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could speak, he could communicate and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not say a word, and she can not use her hands to do anything but grab things. but this film made me understand that there were other people in the world, like my sister, and the end (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I SEE SHAWSHANK !!! This movie is seriously underrated, and it should not. This film tells something to people. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking that you can not write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you are not attractive? This guy was rejected by many girls because of his condition. not the fastest runner? Christy could not even get up. <br /> <br /> My point of view: parents of young children, I suggest to your children to watch this movie with you so that they know the next time they will see someone in the street in a wheelchair they do not look at them like extraterrestrials. My sister has had millions of looks and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening for many people. This film will teach people that people who might not seem "normal" are too. 10/10
