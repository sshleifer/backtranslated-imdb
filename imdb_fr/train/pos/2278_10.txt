Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and I was going to see him. I was expecting a huge disappointment. Instead, I have a film that perfectly depicts the irony, humor, elegance and, most importantly, the overwhelming sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is certainly Nolte's best performance to date. He constantly captures the defeat and courage of Howard Cambell Jr. from the subtle intonations of his speech to the tears held behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee haunts her detachment of reality as a young lover of Cambell. John Goodman is sober and more than effective as a "blue fairy of Cambell". <br /> <br /> This pinnocosque story of Cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and involuntarily becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and alive look what we are as people And apart from that, it's one of the most deeply romantic films I have ever seen. Cambell is the incarnation of foolish and wise love. And at the painfully painful conclusion of the film, he finally understands what it means to be a real boy while his godmother the blue fairy realizes his wish. And he realizes that ... well, watch the movie and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Mother's Night is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made in my mind. It is a beautiful poetic story that plunges into the depths of our emotions and is totally faithful to its original author.
