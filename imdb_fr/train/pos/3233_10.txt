It is a high-level Finnish film this year, although Tango Kabaree is close to it. The director Lampela realized a few years ago another pretty little film called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman ) .Joki is really faithful to the beautiful movie life of a Saturday afternoon in a small village / city. The actors may not be as beautiful or beautiful, but they work wonderfully. I certainly hope that many of them will have the statue of JUSSI (Finnish OSCAR) next spring. I think this film could do it at abroad too.
