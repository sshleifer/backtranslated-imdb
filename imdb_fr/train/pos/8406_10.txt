In 1979, I was a boy of 12 years old. My parents had just received the wicket at home, which was pretty new in our neighborhood. As a 12 year old boy, it was the first time I saw breasts on TV. I will never forget the joy of those times. The pickups, total ass-wiping with the most dreaded van, the waterbed, the smoking of herbs, the hot girls of the 70s, the miraculous love in my Chevy van song, it was so new for me. A complete movie with all the memories you could hope for. I own it and I enjoy it about once a year. When I watch this film, it makes me want to take my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a straight line, go to the park and hunt down feathered babies. really good memories of young teens!
