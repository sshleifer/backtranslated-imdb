The letters without destination are found in another world that is found in the back rooms of the post office. Here, Alice manages to land a job hoping to find her missing father. What she discovers is the tormented soul of her boss, Frank. A little Australian cop coming and going to the movies. Now you'll find it in the dark corner of the video store, overhung by fifty copies of this dreaded GODZILLA movie. It's a shame because this film proved to be satisfactory and tells a courageous story with simple and strong images and effective performances of the two main actors. This film succeeds where DEAR GOD (1996 - USA), the other dead letter of Garry Marshall, failed and approached the shine, not the turkey Kevin Costner, but POSTMAN of He Jianjun (1995 - China ).
