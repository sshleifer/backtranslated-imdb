Gray Gardens is a world in itself. Edith and Little Edie live in almost total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in an improvised kitchen in their (apparently) shared room. Cats walk around while Mother Edith insults her daughter's speech. This is a Tennessee Williams piece that comes alive and should inspire writers and playwrights, as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is a 100% reality. <br /> <br /> The situation at home reminds me exactly how my grandmother and his 50-year-old daughter lived for a decade (other than the one who was poor and clean). They bickered all day, the grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past, while her daughter continually blamed her for her missed opportunities with men, work, and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for anyone writing. a mother / daughter relationship of this kind. It's sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers have done incredible work to make the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so imprudently. It is rare to see real life in this way and all the more special given the context - the remains of a powerful family sinking into nothingness in the skeleton of their own home.
