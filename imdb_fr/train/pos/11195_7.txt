The title has many meanings - the boxing ring, where disputes and grievances are fought, an alliance, where Mabel feels trapped and where Jack feels that his troubles will be over and the cause of the problem, a bracelet shaped like ring that Bill offers to Mabel like a token of love. <br /> <br /> Former Danish professional boxer Carl Brisson made his debut in Alfred Hitchcock's films in "The Ring". A very young Ian Hunter, who has had such a long career in cinema, plays Bob Corby, who attracts the attention of a pretty girl, Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis) at a carnival. She is betrothed to "One Round" by Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) but that does not stop him from flirting with Bob. Bob is persuaded to "go around" with Jack. He's done several rounds and wins - he's a professional boxer and his manager and he came to the show to see if Jack is as good a fighter as they've heard him say. He offers to take Jack and he goes off, along with his Boorish coach (the great Gordon Harker) to make a fortune with his plan to marry Mabel when he succeeds. Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day, but the deep attraction she feels with Bob is always present. Jack is wary and puts everything into his training to fight Bob for his wife. <br /> <br /> Finally a boxing movie where the hero does not derail - Bob is doing well and doing everything he can. to be a champion - if only Mabel acted in the same way !!! She left him for Bob - and the fight at the end is powerful. It is extremely realistic: it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film. Brut and enthusiastic, Jack is almost knocked out - then, between two rounds, getting together with Mabel gives him the courage to triumph. The question is: why would he even want it back? From the start, she did not think of starting an affair with Bob. Why would not she do it again? <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with symbolism. Jack, shaking hands with the promoter, passes to Mabel who accepts a Bob bracelet. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger, the Bobs bracelet slides down his arm. In the end, Jack sees Mabel's reflection in a bucket of water next to the ring, giving her the confidence to continue. This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
