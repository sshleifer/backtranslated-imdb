He gathered characters who would not normally be seen together (not to mention, try to save a human baby and bring him back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as a best friend. If it sounds like a Disney movie, it's (only through 20th Century Fox). The movie trailer is one of the best I've seen in a long time, but the film does not match the trailer's expectation. The problem lies in the fact that the filmmakers did not ask who the film's target audience was. Yes, there are jokes in the movie that only adults will understand, but the film is primarily aimed at children. Parents will appreciate the fact that for 90 min. Their children's attention is focused on something other than themselves. The sets are excellent and the voice is good but it is no longer a beautiful film. Children will love this movie, adults will only love it.
