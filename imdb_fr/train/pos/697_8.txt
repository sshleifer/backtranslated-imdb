It's one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a small budget, it was well done; As an insider, I can understand the main character, although my sleep problems have never been so intense or so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well done, well done, a subject that I have not seen much in theaters, lighting and scenery are perfect for filming. There are few notable blunders, but they can be intentional; you will see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and deserves to be viewed twice. No film is flawless, but a Hollywood version could not make history better. In total, 8/10.
