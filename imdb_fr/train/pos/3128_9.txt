Banal! I like that! Corny - just like the TV show about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt find the same chemistry on the screen that seems never to be gone! They bring back memories of old memories, plus the actors who play them since the 1960s show things behind the scenes that are quite interesting to know. The 1960s TV was at the time a nerdy escape for many of us, and this DVD is no exception, if you know the original TV show. The fight scene with the Boofs and Bams written or anything is fantastic !! The movie theater features excerpts from the dead villains. In the end, Frank Gorshin makes his appearance. I think he died shortly after the creation of this DVD. So it is with great merit that he came back to play Adam and Burt another villain, just like he did at Batman & Robin many years ago. He did not lose his touch! Thanks to Julie Newmar for reliving a nasty role, too. In conclusion, I think this DVD is for good memories and I want to thank Adam and Burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys!!!
