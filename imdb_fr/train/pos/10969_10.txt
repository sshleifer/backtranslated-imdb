I knew but never saw Gray Gardens before seeing the Broadway musical of the same name. Some friends warned me that if I had not seen the movie, the musical would be meaningless. That's what happened, but it also encouraged me to rent the movie. At first I thought it was a train wreck, full of weird and screaming characters, and it was extremely hard to watch. But being able to stop it, digest it and get back to it helped me understand why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their total lack of self-awareness is worth noticing. Both are beautiful despite their age. They have a relationship that will chill all women (and certainly some men) and inspire you to re-examine your own relationship with your mother. At a time when reality television and cinema are commonplace, it's fascinating to see the work of the Mayles three decades ago and realize the impact the film must have had. <br /> <br /> I echo other posters. : how were they allowed to slip into such misery by their family? But beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s escape reality in such a complete way? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? I would highly recommend looking at this with the commentary track, which gave me an additional insight into the movie.
