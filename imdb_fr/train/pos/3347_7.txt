Robert Mitchum plays Clint Tollinger in this short but hard western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional city tamer - as in the case where a city needs someone to flee; it is he who is brought to do it. Tollinger's last concert comes as an accident: walking around the city in search of his old adventure, he falls into a city being played like a puppet by a local Western gangster. But many city dwellers start complaining the day they hired Tollinger, because his way of cleaning the city becomes very trying (suddenly, the High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /> <br /> Man With The Gun begins as a Western hard-to-cook movie, but begins to surprise you more and more as the movie moves on. What begins to be forgettable and banal ends up becoming dark and centered on the characters. The whole movie is very well shot and the cast is very nice. Mitchum is his usual excellent here in Man With The Gun - not one of his best performances. Mitch still has his classic and effective hard-guy presence hard at top speed. the movie right out of the park. Man With The Gun is a good western Mitchum and well worth the time.
