Any true wrestling fan should consider this Wrestlemania as one of the best, if not the best ever. It was full of excitement and surprises. One of the greatest games of all time was between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin with special referee Mike Tyson. The show Michaels presented was amazing, especially considering the shape of his back and his last match.
