They had me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A small sleepy place, similar to Mayberry, with a slight difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There is the spoiler. It's not like you would not have understood in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep it well, but the battle is tough. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. Subtle. Sly. It does not always come as an evil. Most of the time, he is a hero. Everyone owes him a great favor because he often creates a calamity and saves him. So, whenever you think someone is finally going to demolish him, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage him. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with rifles decided to steal them. Lucas used it as a pretext to give Caleb a lesson in evil. <br /> <br /> The thief (Ted) was reluctant to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted had a half-consciousness. If he had no conscience, he would have already slaughtered them. If he had a real conscience, he would never have become a criminal. So he started calling him Half-Ted. It was pretty funny. He made fun of criminals. And of course, he always kept 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted. And of course, he had complete control at all times. They made you prefer Satan. <br /> <br /> Very very excellent show. it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Fascinating American Gothic Circle of Fear <br /> <br /> It's a good company.
