It's one of those movies / drivers that if you know BattleStar Galactica, it helps, but it's not necessary. What makes this story even more credible than BSG is that it is not so far into the future. It's so deep that it's pretty amazing not to have it released in cinemas. The main roles could not have been better chosen by such experienced and talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superb as a father who will do everything to be reunited with his daughter, whether real or not, and that he will do it at any cost. Paula Malcomson of "Deadwood" is a wonderful woman. You're not quite sure of his motives, whether it's love, money, or both, but that's what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the shooting of Zoe performed by the relatively unknown Alessandra Torresani & her performance. Esai Morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again and how bad it is to even consider what he wants more than his moral objections. I did not think it would be a good idea at the time of the announcement, but I'm delighted to see how we arrived at the GRB scenario. It's great to see Adama as a child already affected and influenced by the different kinds of robots that begin to permeate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep the stories so we can understand even more how they got the Humanoid typed robots. He is an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can continue to tell fantastic stories. Even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you do not know BSG well, try at least this and I bet you become a fan and want to see how BSG's story was born.
