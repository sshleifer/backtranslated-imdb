What a beautiful Barbara Stanwyck movie I saw the other night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was manufactured in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and his son (Lee Aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. Her husband has fallen from the pier and the only way to save him is if Barbara returns to the garage to fetch a rope. <br /> <br /> She then falls on a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and the following is a cat and mouse game while Barbara tries to do everything so that Meeker comes back with her so to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The film was so moving and so surprising. - I did not expect such a good movie. But I guess I should have realized: is there something Barbara Stanwyck does that is not wonderful?
