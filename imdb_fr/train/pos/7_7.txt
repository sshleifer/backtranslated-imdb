Although I do not really like Stanley & Iris as a movie, I still admired the acting. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are excellent in this movie. I have not always been fond of Fonda's work, but here she is both delicate and powerful. De Niro has the ability to transform every role he represents into a gold player. He gives an excellent performance in this film and there is a big scene in which he has to take his father to a home for the elderly because he can not take care of him anymore, which would break his heart. I would not really recommend this film as a great movie entertainment, but I will say that you will not see much of acting elsewhere.
