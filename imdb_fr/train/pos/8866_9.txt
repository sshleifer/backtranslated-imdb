"COSBY", in my opinion, is a hit of CBS! I do not know if I've ever seen all the episodes, but I've always liked it. It's hard to say which one is my favorite. In addition, I really liked the theme song. If you asked me, even though I loved everyone, it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn had not died during the show. Since then, I've always wondered what the show would look like. Everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes well designed and the writing still very strong. In conclusion, even if it is visible on TBS now, I strongly recommend that you catch it in case it stops working.
