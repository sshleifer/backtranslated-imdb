I surprised him during a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and I was impressed by the absolute power of this film. It is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the army with the hope that they will protect and serve our country with honor and that our government will take care of that. The film details the psychological changes that occur in the training camp when the soldiers are turned into "killers for their country" and are put into the war and the aftermath when they return home. It also describes the effect that murder has on the human psyche. It pays tribute to soldiers and never criticizes soldiers, unlike other films, but criticizes a system that is unprepared and does not support all the physical and psychological needs of returning veterans. <br /> <br /> This film is powerful, moving, emotional and provoking reflection. This is a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades, but also by listening to them and helping to support a change in the way their health and well-being are supported after the end of the killings. <br /> <br /> The best film of the festival so far, **** / ****
