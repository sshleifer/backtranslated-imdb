The second installment of the series Why We Fight focuses on Hitler's attack on the Sudetenlands beyond Neville Chamberlain's domination of the latter, before embarking on his conquest of Europe. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this series over time became propaganda at the time: it became an informational documentary and most of the "allied prejudices" turn out to be historical facts. The FÃ¼hrer himself raises himself on his own firecracker with sufficient statements in front of his people and the whole world, while saying one thing and doing another while his army is moving east. The Czechs and Austrians quickly surrendered, but the Poles fought a heroic battle against all odds. <br /> <br /> The disparity between the military power of Hitler and Chamberlain waving the Treaty of Munich like a white flag, declaring that "peace in our time" has, to this day, lasting propaganda qualities. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of the Second World War intrudes into Europe, leaving the American viewer with two options, freedom or slavery. In 1943, this simple truth was not evaded and The Nazis Strike made clear his point of view.
