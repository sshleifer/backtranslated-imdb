The first time I saw the Frailty trailer on Yahoo Movies, after hearing Stephen King congratulate him in the sky. Not really a fan of either star, I always wanted to see him because I'm a huge thriller fan. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The acting was superb, especially from the two young boys. I usually hate acting kids, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton has also done a good job. It was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> We must also note the twists and turns of the plot. The three turns at the end were hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. The last turn of the film, combined with the gravity of what has just been revealed, still gives me shivers, even if I saw it so often. <br /> <br /> A real gem.
