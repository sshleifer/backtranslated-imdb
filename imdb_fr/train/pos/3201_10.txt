This is a first film "Pilot" of the famous Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. Before Showcase decided to put them on a TV show, it was broadcast on networks belonging to a few networks. A good acting and a very entertaining cast make this film one of the best cult comedy films. The film's scenario is that these two little criminals will "exterminate" people's pets for money. If you have a dog next door that barks all night, these are the guys you are going to! But they find themselves in a difficult situation when they meet an unbearable job and find themselves in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> R rated for swearing, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It's not too offensive either (they do not actually show the killing of animals)
