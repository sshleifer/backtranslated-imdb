A good film. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a special mention for the "Portobello Ballet" are magnificent. With regard to the animated section, the confrontation of animals has become an instant classic; the climax with the attack of the frames is scary and fascinating. I recommend seeing the restored version of 134 minutes or at least the 112-minute video. Here in Italy, we only have the 98-minute version, although the film was presented in its original version after 117 minutes. If possible, also watch the German videocassette: it was generated from the 98 minutes that followed, but it lacks everything related to the Second World War and all the scenes between the English and their Nazi invaders!
