Paris, I love you (2006) is a film composed of 18 segments. You can do the math - 18 segments in 120 minutes means each director has seven minutes to tell their story. The film is based on the premise that you can, indeed, tell a story in such a short time. The premise works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each one presents a different aspect of the Parisian experience and almost all the directors realize remarkable performances presented by a troupe of big and almost big actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful performances in this film that it was difficult to pick one or two favorites. The most memorable ones for me have probably been Juliette Binoche, mother afflicted with the "Place des Victoires" segment, Gena Rowlands, aging beauty of the "Latin Quarter", Catalina Sandino Moreno, cleaning lady of the "Far 16th" segment and Margo Martindale is a Colorado man who learned to speak French so he could visit Paris (segment "14th Arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> A special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq, probably the ugliest little boy who has ever harassed an American tourist in a Paris metro station (segment "Tuileries"). <br /> <br /> an exceptional film. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we could grab some of the subtle points we surely missed. However, Paris is so beautifully photographed that I suggest you try to see it on a big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
