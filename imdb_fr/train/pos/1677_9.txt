The Coda Dello Scorpione (case.k.a. of the tail of the scorpion) was the sequel given by the director Sergio Martino to the wonderful giallo film Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the giallo par excellence, featuring all the aspects that fans of the genre have come to know and love. A complicated terrain, pretty girls, black gloves, sharp blades and a sprig of gore unite to create a hunk of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, make this gialli one of the best non-Argento. Martino added his touches as director, the great giallo Ernesto Gastaldi as a writer, screenwriter Bruno Nicolai, and a galaxy of giallo stars and starlets, such as George Hilton, actor Luigi Pistilli, and the crazy Anita Strindberg. <With all this talent behind, does Scorpione deliver? You bet. The film works on several levels. It's a mystery of passionate murder, a tense and violent horror film and a thriller thriller. In summary, one of the best gialli in the world. <br /> <br /> Martino knows what fans want from gialli. At times in the film, he almost seems to channel Argento into his approach. For example, in Bird with the Crystal Plumage, this is a real scam where the killer tries to break through the door, which in fact surpasses the Argento movie. <br /> <br /> Does the film have problems? ? Hmmm ... only minors. First, all the scenes that do not follow the murders or the incipient romance between the two characters start to get bored. But just before you fall asleep, the killer will come out of nowhere and you'll be back in the thick of things. <br /> <br /> In addition, towards the end, the twists become a little too weird. I mean, what are the scorpion pins for? If you do not pay close attention to the dialogue, you risk losing yourself with the twisted and woven intrigue. <br /> <br /> But these little problems are aside, The Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, suspenseful, chic film and all-around entertaining movie for giallo fans. Look for it!
