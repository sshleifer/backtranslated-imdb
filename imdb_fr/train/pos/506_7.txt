An experienced pilot, this two-hour episode is a great work on setting up characters and the background for "Enterprise", the "precedent" of the original "Star Trek" series. It falls a few times in the "Trek" convention and the clich√© - the candy-colored space strippers never seem out of fashion, and I can already foresee sneering references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the Together, the characters are well drawn, and we can already see indications that this crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways, than those of previous (later) series. Scott Bakula has the right tone as a captain with Kirk's temerity and audacity, but without his phlegm and braggart look, and I look forward to seeing how the series will feature the engineer, the master d 'weapons and communications manager (no longer just a glorified phone operator!) as support players. The writers seem to have realized the big mistake made in "Star Trek: The New Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": instead of starting with a big cast overall and give the characters a brief overview we start with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later - which, I hope, will happen, because after about half a dozen episodes, it will take more variety.
