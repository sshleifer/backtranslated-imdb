"Foxes" is a film that I remember for its teenage portrayal in the late 1970s. As I'm exactly Jodie Foster's age, I told myself this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of youth. The soundtrack is great with an inspiring rock, for example. "More than a feeling" from Boston and sad numbers like "On the radio" by Donna Summer. The music of my late teens. Yes, I will always remember this one, even if it was not huge.
