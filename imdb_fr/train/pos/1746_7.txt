Bela Lugosi has to play one of his rare roles as a man in a series based on a long radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film in which Lugosi played the villain.) Did not have more than roles where he might be the guy who commands. Chandu returns from the East to help Princess Nadji, pursued by Ubasti cult leaders, who needs her to bring back the dead to the high priestess of their worship. This is a beautiful globe trotting series that is very entertaining. To be certain that the pace is a bit soft, more like one of the directors (the production studios) then has a heartbreaking adventure, but it's still nice. It's better than the two feature films that have been cut, because it helps to get things done at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or feeling like, "Hey, I missed something." One of the trilogies of three good serials that Lugosi has made, the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
