Presenting Lily Mars is a nice little film that showcases the actress Judy Garland's actress, as well as her usual singing moments. The plot consists of the intervention of Lily Mars after the producer John Thornway for its big exit. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this movie to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
