If Mulder was looking for his real father, it was Darren McGavin, the first X Files, but it was only during one season that the producers of this show did not know that they had the stuff of a classic, and in 1993 Chris Carter arrived with what I call the sequel to The Night Stalker, The X Files. In my opinion, both series will remain classics. Both series will take viewers to a level of experience that only comes from time to time and should feature in the X Files years later, Darren McGavin, as Arthur Dales agent helping our two favorite heroes. , s solve cases. Paying tribute to the man I think, well done, Chris Carter reported a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny in the role of Darren McGavin if it was not about watching X files and this particular show I never knew about Night Stalker.
