I just saw this film today at the Seattle International Film Festival and I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Excellent writing and production, excellent and credible interaction between actors, as well as good comic timing. <br /> This film addresses themes that are the universal family and separation. As a result, I can see the European, Asian and American audiences all finding common points between this movie and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all that was not enough, it could be the best underground date movie of the year ... someone distributes this in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It's really a good movie.
