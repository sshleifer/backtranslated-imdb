Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have heard the least about - it is essentially based on the same principles as the second and fourth principles and is not revolutionary. But he's still great - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a big idiot Dr Johnson (author of the first dictionary in England) make this series a piece to be reckoned with. There are still more hilarious one-liners to deliver in this series, and that brings out humor in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third release is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's Butler's role as butler of a silly prince is funny and well played, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very well! 9/10
