I must say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane. I have seen other versions, but none compare to this one. The best for me. I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again. The last time I saw this one was in 1984, when I was only 13 years old. At the time, I was a bookworm and I had just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was completely delighted by this miniseries and I remember not missing any episodes. I would like to see him again because it's so good. :-)
