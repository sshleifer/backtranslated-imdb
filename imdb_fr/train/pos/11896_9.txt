I stumbled upon the rebroadcast of this program several years ago and fell in love with it. He presents TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and made me laugh, episode after episode. I guess that did not make the difference and was canceled after a few seasons, but I think it was a good race and I would suggest to watch it ... if the opportunity arose.
