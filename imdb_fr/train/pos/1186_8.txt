There has been a lot of talk about Western psychology, but it's one of the few that really belongs to this genre. There are stars who play very well, but it is the director who makes this film such a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his stereotype of British safari hunter to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the leading role (unlike the usual young beginner, Taylor is also middle-aged), who wants to shoot buffaloes and brings Granger into business with him. They hire two other great actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn, to become their skinners. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he killed, knowing that he could be blamed in case of extinction, knowing that if this is the case, the way of life of the Amerindians will suffer enormously. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is a realistic sadism, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of modern film, created by nerds and dorks. He is not sure and needs human companionship. Yet he will not stop at murder. The end opposes the two against each other, with a surprising conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well described.
