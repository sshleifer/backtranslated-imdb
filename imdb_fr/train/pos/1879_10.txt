I was too young to remember when I saw this film for the first time. But I saw it for the second time about 7 years ago. My sister told me that I had to see him. Now, all my family has memorized it. We quote it at least once a day. I love that movie. I'm still laughing after all this time. Of course, it's a million, really drunk, irresponsible. The problem is that he still has humanity lost in the others we see in the film. And that he is ready to give up everything for love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh. Lots of laughs. It's amazing, adorable, and if you're a movie buff, it will really change your idea of ​​"Funny." Look at it with a group of friends or with your family and I promise you that you will never have anything to tell with some Authur lines in your head. This will make you laugh for years. <br /> <br /> It's very difficult in my family to find a movie that everyone likes. But this film, I think, brought us closer together. And I know it will do the same for you !!
