This is one of those movies that make better trailers than feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt there were missed opportunities to put the "punch" in this movie. So many lines and gags have been left for too long, no precise end and have not really let me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was underused in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to turn her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more than one DVD rental. In addition, I was looking for some kind of beneficial music video in the end credits, something that has become somewhat of a trademark for those romantic comedy films, something fashionable Mary, meets the parents, but still a I was a little bit cheated by the fact that it could have been a much better movie with a little more music and more punchy typing lines. It was like being thrown into the theaters.
