After '' Empire Strikes Back '' '' 'The Return of the Jedi' 'is my second favorite movie in the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke traveled to Attatto to save Han Solo from Jabba. Meanwhile, the Galactic Empire secretly proceeds to build a new space station like that of the previous Star of Death. If this station remains totally built, it will be the end of the rebel alliance. Vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star and they have to kill many of their commanders for the project to be completed as planned. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are in the Jabba palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba, where Lukes claims to negotiate Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept negotiation, since he uses Han Solo as a decoration piece of his palace (Han is still frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as a guardian of Jabba and Chewbacca is also given to Jabba by a hunter rewards. When the same hunter tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that this is actually the disguised princess Leia. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia's plan and takes her for a slave, while Han is thrown into Chewbacca's cell. <br /> <br /> Luke comes as a Jedi Knight to help his friends. At his first attempt to kill Jabba, he falls into the Jabba (Bantha) monster cell, but kills her easily. Jabba remains angry and decides to throw Han, Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a great creature of the desert who remains 1,000 years to digest his "food". Luke, Han and Chewie are once again successful in the field, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him into Sarlacc's mouth. Leia kills Jabba and chases Han, Luke and Chewie, as well as c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his Jedi training, as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he is already 900 years old. Before dying, Yoda tells Luke that he does not need more training, but to be really a Jedi, he has to fight again with Vader. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's father and that there is another Skywalker next to Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luke to remember his advice on the temptation of the dark side, and Luke to pass on his Jedi knowledge to others. When Yoda dies, Obi wan's spirit comes to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader and that he is more of a machine than a man since he was become sith. Luke remains worried about killing his own father and says he feels that his father is always kind. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and explains why Luke and Leia have been separated since their baby. He gives his last advice to Luke telling him that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the emperor tells Vader that he has to give him Luke when he shows up, because Luke is stronger than before, and they have to combine their efforts to get Luke to the side. obscure. <br /> <br /> We will now have one of the best battles of the Star War series, when the rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, Death Star 2, Luke will face Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and Chewie will have to extinguish the Death Star 2's power field with the help of the EWOKS. (small creatures that look like little bears) <br /> <br /> This is for sure one of the most exciting wars!
