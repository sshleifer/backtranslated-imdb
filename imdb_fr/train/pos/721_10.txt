ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the Ramones. I was too young during the heyday of the group to be very aware of it, even though I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally saw RNRHS on television one afternoon in the mid-1980s, at about fifteen, and I had a good laugh. (Is not it the dream of every high school student to destroy his school and blow it up, all on a rock soundtrack?) Again, thinking "Dude, these guys kick your ass! I need to check some of their albums! " The rest is history. Twenty years ago, many Ramones CD's / tapes / CDs, and three Ramones later, they're still part of my favorite bands of all time and RNRHS always makes me crack every time I watch it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (all RP members), we have at least this movie and tons of quality music to remember.
