After the initial shock of realizing Mr. Branagh's courage to film this, I literally trembled with joy at seeing this epic right in front of me. I was not deceived. So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It cut my mind. I still enjoy seeing or rather listening to Branagh and it made me wonder ... is this film being dubbed in other countries? It would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
