A good movie about Downs syndrome. A mother has twins, one is very sick the other is good but he has problems The mother does not think she can raise her, so she gives it to some people who have 15 children and 11 who have problems! the mom does not like it and she thinks he should be with his family (I agree too) so they go to court and the family is broken and the grandparents lose, we never really say if the makeup of mother and daughter? I think this movie is good but the plot is familiar, it's still good and has some unintentional laughs!
