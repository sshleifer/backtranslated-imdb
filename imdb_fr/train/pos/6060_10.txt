It's an excellent documentary film. Any racing fan should have a copy of this great movie. The director "Stephen Low" did an excellent job, as well as the main stars of the film, Father & Son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and looks amazing. And the best of all is IMAX! Excellent home theater test disc.
