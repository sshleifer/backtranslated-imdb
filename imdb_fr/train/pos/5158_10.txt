There is something convincing and strangely believable in this episode. From the beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the certainty that a planet will explode in a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy rushed to evacuate the residents, all of whom seem to have gone to unknown places, except for one elderly librarian. <br /> <br /> The librarian gives polite but mysterious advice on where all citizens are interrupted by a crisis in which the three members of the Enterprise team suddenly find themselves thrown into different eras of the past of the planet. Kirk is in a period resembling 17th century England, while Spock and McCoy are stuck in desolate and frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The interconnection between the two stories and the different dangerous situations in which the men find themselves are superbly managed, with a return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes break down to the explosion of the planet. <br /> <br /> This episode is characterized by imaginative writing and delirious acting, with a touching performance by Mariette Hartley in exile in the Ice Age and Ian Wolfe as an urban librarian. This time travel story is a rich and fascinating finale of the series, which concluded an episode later. This must be one of the best in the series, particularly remarkable given the generally lower quality of the third season.
