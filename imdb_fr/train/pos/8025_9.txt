I like this film. the songs and stories are very funny. and the song "say goodbye" still moves me. what a brilliant thing to do to give life to puppets, so that you care about these things made of fabric, fabric, etc. great voices and great talent. why were all the other muppet movies that came after this one much less interesting, moving, and fun? does mr. Henson is so much missed?
