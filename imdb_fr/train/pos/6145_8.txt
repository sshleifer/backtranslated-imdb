Mary Poppins is much better, but it's still a beautiful movie. Angela Lansbury is as crazy as Engletine Price and David Tomlinson has a lot of fun as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was as brilliant. The children, however, lacked the same brilliance, although Paul is very funny and cute. The songs were actually not as bad as some people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact all the songs are exceptional. The special effects were wonderful, rich in magic and the story is quite original. Like Mary Poppins, the highlights were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was the football game, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I did not quite understand the end when I saw it for the first time. All in all, it's a beautiful film that almost never runs. 8/10 Bethany Cox
