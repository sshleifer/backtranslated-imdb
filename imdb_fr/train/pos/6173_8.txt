A great movie. The comedy - from the doctor to the sidewalk artist to the chief prostitute, with very few exceptions - was wonderful; I thought that soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best actors less known. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who could be accused of acting excessively, had a rather credible and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another great thing was the work of the camera - and his way of capturing the energy of gustad's tranquility reciting his prayers and his life in the tiny apartments. <br /> <br /> The story of the wall that turned into a sanctuary and collapsed was appreciated by the artists. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies about Indian themes.
