Theo Robertson said that WAW did not adequately cover the conditions after the First World War that led to Hitler's rise and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first and quarter HOURS of volume 8? Covers this period and, with the first volumes of the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, in my opinion. One of my friends grew up in Germany during this period and even joined Hitler's youth. His experiences are very similar to those mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is SO MUCH superior to the documentaries of the History Channel. clean, that there is no comparison possible. <br /> <br /> THE ONLY defect, and it's a small problem, that I have with WAW is: the numbers are not included, often. For example, if you are talking about lend-lease, how much war material has been lent / rented? How much in Russia, how much in Britian? How many merchant ships did the U-Boats sink and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese navy have in total in 1941? What type were they? How many troops? How many troops did the allies have in total and by country? Many numbers could have forgotten a lot of viewers, but I would have preferred MORE! And of course, I always want to see more military analysis. Like WHY did Patton & Clark not trap the German army that was in Cassini after encircling it instead of running Monty in Rome and letting it escape? I do not think you can begin to understand the war until you have seen some of these video clips about "total war", like the bombing of Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see the death camps clips: you just can not understand, it's too amazing. <br /> <br /> Unknown at this time, and Of course, not filmed, were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the Japanese, including cannibalism (read "Flyboys"), and some vivisection TRUE of prisoners of "experimentation" medical, without anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
