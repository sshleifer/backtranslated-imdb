Dirty Sanchez is the most extreme British version of Jackass in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) strive to hurt each other and humiliate each other. This show is better than Jackass because most stunts are unplanned, which makes the reaction a lot more funny. There are 3 series of the series, the first follows them and examines their life, for example. there is an episode about their love lives, their jobs, etc. The second series sends boys to try different professions. The third follows their European tour. It seems that boys are becoming more daring as the series progresses. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I tell you that if you have a week's stomach, DO NOT WATCH, because you just have to see a good amount of blood and vomit at each episode.
