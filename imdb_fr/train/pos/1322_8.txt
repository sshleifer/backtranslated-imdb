What a fascinating film. Even though it was not based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a rogue in his element. And this is the kind of cinematic psychology that students could study to learn more about compulsive liars. <br /> <br /> The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, was revealed as a fraud in the media, but this decision really gives him a lot of possibilities. to erase his name. <br /> <br /> But the twists and turns she's subjected to the documentary are amazing. What a patient woman! I loved this film. I did not read the book but I just heard good reviews and went to see him on a boring rainy afternoon. The course of this film is clever, interesting and totally captivating.
