"Crush" examines female friendship, mostly avoiding the quality of saccharine that spoils so many movies on the same theme (for example, "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. The events described were highly improbable, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very authentic to me. It's not a movie for the crowd of vehicles that run at the speed of explosion or explode, but adult women will be sure to react with a laugh and cry.
