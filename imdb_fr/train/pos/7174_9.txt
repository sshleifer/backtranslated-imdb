I went from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see the premiere of this movie - and I'm really glad I did. I've been a big fan of cinema and Northern California since forever, so I was surprised to see how many Academy Award-winning films were shot in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the San Francisco Bay Area rather than going to Los Angeles, George Lucas's comments about persistence, community, and a vision really fit me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all other filmmakers can succeed in SF, other artists can. <br /> <br /> Recommend this movie
