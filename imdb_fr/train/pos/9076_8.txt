This should be one of the funniest TV sitcoms out of the United States since the demise of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always hilarious and perfectly complements the rest of the cast. David Spade continues to tickle my bone tremendously funny with his rather unique lines. After worshiping the British series, "Coupling", I can see exactly where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" had their original idea, but this is not meant to be a "brickbat" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way forward what is transmitted defines this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to succeed a new series, especially in the very difficult field of comedy. As a member of a team of professional television writers for almost 7 years in Australia, I can particularly appreciate the role of director and the talent of creation and perception of the film crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is very clearly the "canned" laugh. An audience could have been used for the filming of the series.
