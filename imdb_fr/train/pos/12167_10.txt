What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that he stops working? How can only one man have? When the mundane shit we have to do to become part of society becomes too much, what happens? Frownland explores these questions. A surprising original beginning of Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic as we enter the head of a guy named Keith who is so messed up that he can barely form a correct sentence. We follow him as he tries to make contact with people and to work day after day. Most of us have known people like this - people who say "sorry" too much or "I appreciate it" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people like that, but why would you want to make a film about them? Well, because it's interesting and Bronstein and lead actor Dore Mann do a great job. This movie is about as commercial as a movie can have. Some friends have filmed it in recent years to save money. It was shot in 16mm and the look of the striped film is beautifully low budget. Without a distributor, it may be a difficult problem to find, I think the screening was done randomly over the past year. Hope it will be on DVD at some point. I saw it at the silent cinema here in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if that tells you something about how strange this movie is. Highly recommended.
