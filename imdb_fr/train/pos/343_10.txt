Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards and David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what the film was about, these names were enough to attract me. Beautiful, talented and popular, they are interpreters to watch. <br /> <br /> Ok, where do I start? We already know what the movie is about. Five beautiful girls are the target of a serial "romantic" slasher, a guy they all refused to dance to school 13 years ago. Its trademarks include subtle death threats disguised as Valentine's Day cards, flea-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose. His weapon of choice: well, take a pickaxe, a knife, an electric drill, a bow and arrows, an iron, etc. OK, so it's basically a horror movie with a twisted sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are not supposed to be Shakespeare, but I will not go there. I love horror movies, but not all. This one, I love it. It's high with some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and scary. The killer's mask is appallingly childish, and seeing Cupid shooting a bow and arrows on a victim is really scary. The acting is great: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very entertaining. I really wanted to see a lot, a lot more from Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and I would love to see her soon to do a great job. Jessica Capshaw is a very competent actress and Jessica Cauffiel must play the role of blonde ditezy she perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller roles were also good; Hedy Buress was funny ('bleedmedry.com') and that younger version of Denise Richards looked terribly like him. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Every scene of death had a special distinction. The scariest being the opening scene of the morgue. The hottub scene, although ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual labyrinth was sinister. The soundtrack is excellent, with scary music and some refined alternative tunes. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt as if the killer was not shown enough, we barely saw the mask, and it was not presented at all during the climax. I also thought that the highlight was really blurry, but fun anyway. <br /> <br /> The turn at the end was not such a big surprise, but I'm really happy that the filmmakers decided to spare us all that. Explain the killer's routine <br /> <br /> I do not like to tell people what movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that I thought was really interesting to see, then Valentine would be it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
