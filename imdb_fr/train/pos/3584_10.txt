My name is Heather and I am the girl whose film is based on history. I want to thank everyone who saw this film and appreciated it. as rude and harsh as some of the things that have been portrayed in this film, it was not even close to describing how bad things were. not to mention the affect that everything has had on my mother and my little sister. thank you again for the excellent comments of everyone, I really appreciate <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mother. It is hard to believe that so many years have passed since this film was shot. Even harder to believe that people were still watching him a year ago. For all of you who have experienced the same or similar situation, know that in cyberspace, people fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each one of you.
