"Saving Grace" is never very funny, but it gives lots of laughs and I appreciated it significantly. Brenda Blethyn is an excellent actress and does a good job interpreting widow Grace, who uses marijuana to pay off her huge debts. The support distribution is also doing a good job. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role. The premise alone is attractive. The idea of ​​a growing and growing woman smoking marijuana sounds pretty amusing. And the film plays with the places wisely from time to time. Of course, there are flat moments, like when two older women take Grace's marijuana for tea and start drawing childish antics in the store where they work. It was a stupid gag that did not quite take off. The tone of the film is dark and sometimes dull, but I have enough laugh to give a recommendation to this English import. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
