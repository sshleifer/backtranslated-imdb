I saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" for the first time during his first appearance on television. In fact, I thought I would see the movie at the time of the advertisement and it lived up to my expectations. I have now bought the DVD and I plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's a wonderful life", I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" as one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a superb cast led by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and the acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique. How can we remember Patton and Scrooge? Scott does so easily. The management is wonderful with the refined decorations, costumes and music that give the film a special feeling of time, place and time. You will simply love this movie and place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
