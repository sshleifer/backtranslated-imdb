This is the second film based on the life and times of the hottest porn star, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also based on his life. Maybe someday, someone will shoot a movie about Tommy Byron's life instead. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story is not very well told. Many episodes of Law & Order have more twists than Wonderland, and the director never enters the criminal trial enthusiastically. Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not as suspended as Holmes (and no prosthesis this time, unlike Boogie Nights), and he is much more handsome than mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not introduce a single sympathetic individual among the actors. The racist and immature he lives with his wife or his wife, and the police do not make much reproach. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is Eric Bogosian who tells Paris Hilton to "get lost". <br /> <br /> That said, anyone interested in the shady side of the porn trade in the 1980s or the real crime should not miss it.
