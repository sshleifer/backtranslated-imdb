As I reflect on this film, I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. Coup de Torchon is relatively forgettable but covers the same geography, the other thousands of kilometers and the unforgettable Indochina is much larger. Claire Denis has produced a film that presents some of the foundations of Indochina, the complex and unexpressed relationship between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the dignity of Potee and his fight for the maintenance of his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck by the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter who gives the film its driving force, it is the latter that links this film to Indochina. <br /> <br /> You never really know what motivates everyone, even if some characters are required to recall colonialism. It is this cynical aspect of the story that connects him to Coup de Torchon. Their story is more scandalous, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis reminds us of what it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American black who gives the adult A tour of France at the beginning and the end of the film offers another interesting aspect to the confusion we have in the Western world when we examine Africa. He says that when he came, he wanted to call everyone brother. He was coming home, but they thought he was a little silly. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but neither of them fully understand what it is, even if they remember the situation. <br /> <br />
