I was disappointed, if not surprised at the lack of appreciation that this film received. Once again, Billy Zane proves that he is more than a handsome Hollywood boy in a silent performance that combines spasmic slapstick and discreet pathetic. To qualify this movie as a silent film is incorrect because there is a lot of music and sounds. He has a maniacal pace and is full of clumsy inventiveness for which Wood finally begins to be appreciated. Look at the list of actors and realize that everyone is shining. Nobody is there just to show their faces. I think they are all in the movie to show their appreciation of Wood and to make a broad and physical acting game that has not been seen much these days. <br /> <br /> But today, critics try to guess what happens to be a success much more than they show any aesthetic appreciation for a movie. And IWUETDID does not have a targeted audience. This was done mainly out of love for Wood's script. Even after his death, the fashionable social parasites took him another serious blow and deprived the world of a minor classic. It's a very entertaining and truly experimental film that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
