Skippy from Family Ties goes from the clean cut to the metal kid in this rather old-fashioned movie. The film seems to have been shot in response to all those upset parents who claimed that metal music made their children diabolical or made them kill themselves - except that in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to get back from the falls (using Skippy). help). And while the plot is lame and clich√©, the cornea (for example, a perverse green fog that removes a girl's clothes) and the soundtrack are what makes the film so hilarious (and awesome). And of course, nothing resembles Ozzy Osbourne who plays a preacher who asks what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie to have some friends for a good laugh. And while you're there, make it a double star with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there is a "diabolical" piercer (as shown on the video box) in black leather with fringes. A must for cheese fans.
