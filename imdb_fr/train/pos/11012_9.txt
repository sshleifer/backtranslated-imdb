At first, I did not really know if I was watching a documentary, a propaganda film or a dramatic presentation. I guess given the production time, it was a mix of all three. <br /> <br /> It is true that the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had the impression that there would be interesting scenes as the movie progresses. We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training patterns and training materials. <br /> <br /> The end of this film has been closer to the end. The scenes had a realism (at least as I had perceived) that I had never met before. You can get into action and imagine the thoughts of young fighters. This mingled with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when one might think that real Japanese actors would be a bit rare. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent as a source of the American state of mind in 1943, the war with Japan. It is also interesting to note that the Japanese appreciated the assistance that the United States has provided to Japan in recent years.
