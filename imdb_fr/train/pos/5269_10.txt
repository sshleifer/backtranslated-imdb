I love bad movies. Not only because they are often as entertaining as "really" "good" movies (like the Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos), but they are often much better than these movies. And that's why I love Italian scam movies from the 1970s and 1980s. And that's why I particularly like this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato has produced some great films, such as House on the Edge of the Park and his Atlantis Interceptors. and Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man are enjoyable action movies. But it's really bad. The Barbarians is such a silly movie. Peter and David Paul, as barbaric brothers Kutchek and Gore, are very amusing because of their lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they scream and scream every time they do something important. In one scene, people try to suspend the barbarian brothers and they escape in a very extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad effects, very stupid story, wrong direction, in fact everything is bad in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when I watched this first time. The Barbarians & the Company is a classic camp that everyone should see once. If you thought that the Plan 9 camp of space is fun, it will be a real killer.
