I first saw this movie over 25 years ago on British TV and only caught up with it last week with a DVD copy purchased from eBay. I remembered the music, the color and the superb fashion base, but the plot is weaker than Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding's previous film, Spring in Park Lane, and Maytime can not resist. not so good over the years. . But Michael Wilding is a joy in the film, charming, funny, debonair, seems to have a lot of fun and is in top form. It's worth watching alone. Anna Neagle appears a little too naughty by her side and a little too old for the role she plays, but by the late 1940s, their film partnership was well established with the passage of the audience to the cinema. Spring in Park Lane had been a dazzling success in 1947 and a big source of money. In his autobiography, Wilding has long described his great respect for Herbert Wilcox, director and instigator of this London film series.
