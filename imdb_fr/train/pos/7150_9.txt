What a great movie! This is reminiscent of the wonderful classic movies of the Disney family of the '60s and' 70s. I was very pleasantly surprised after the last 20 years of absolute trash, Disney's live production crews have come out. <br /> <br /> This film is an absolute joy. The children-stars were just that; professional and quality actors. I am very impressed by the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophant hyperbole * inserted here * running a prison camp for misguided boys. Siobhan Fallon has been wonderful as the star's mother. <br /> <br /> I will not come back on the story because there is no point in starting again, but the story is beautiful, the staging was extraordinary and the quality of actor was superb! This work reminds you of what it is like to be a child, without being too sweet or too dark. The deleted scenes presented on the DVD version were really better left out. They were too hard for this film and would have taken so much. Although the finished product has been abused, it has not been clearly demonstrated beyond a certain extent. It was better that way. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely delicious movie to watch. <br /> <br /> He gets a 9/10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
