I had seen a red-haired lady at her appearance, and I did not remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, despite its foundation in a true story, its on-screen game is stupid and unbelievable. The true merit of the image is the distribution. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the '30s and' 40s is the essence of the delicate and clever work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins and the spectacularly beautiful performance of Claude Rains, who, as usual, is the best things to do. the image. What actor! He has never won an Oscar, but he is in good company with Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Maybe Lady with Red Hair contains her best work in movies. See and enjoy him. <br /> <br />
