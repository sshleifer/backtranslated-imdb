Johnny and June Carter Cash have funded this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories. The music is great, you have a real idea of ​​what the world of Jesus looked like (I went too), and June is passionate about the role of Mary Magdalene. The narration of money is good too. <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was a bad idea. 2. There is no advantage in the story that Cash inserts part of his faith-based music. 3. Because this is not convincing, I doubt that we can see it again widely distributed. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy the CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, United States
