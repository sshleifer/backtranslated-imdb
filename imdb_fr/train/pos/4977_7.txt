So many educational films are nothing but tedious tasks, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" makes fun of them ("Why study the industrial arts?" Comes to mind). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done. Everything is based on the blood, the heart and the circulatory system. I admit that I do not remember everything, but it explains everything very well, while remaining serious but fun. I guess you can always count on June Foray (the most famous voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays a deer here). <br /> <br /> Since "Hemo the Magnificent" is hard to find, probably The best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class watches it while a Gremlin is forming.
