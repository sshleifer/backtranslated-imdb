When the United States entered the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to produce propaganda films. THE SMALL American is probably the best of the lot as she stars Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but his decision is delayed because of the war while the two men enlist. <br /> <br /> When the ship on which Pickford is engaged vogue is sunk by the Germans (think Lusitania) as it carries ammunition, Pickford lifeboat and howls to the German commander. Later, of course, she meets Holt and Hatton when she is held as a prisoner of war in a castle. <br /> <br /> The director Cecil B. DeMille offers a really fantastic scene in this film, Pickford and Holt walks in a bombed village. They pass a destroyed church with only one wall standing. Against the wall is a very large crucifix. As they stand and look, the wall collapses, but the figure of Jesus remains suspended in the air. It's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very simple and not very artistic. <br /> <br /> Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. She has always been a very natural actress who avoided the histrionic agitated by the arms of many other actors of the time. She is also very very pretty. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is fine. Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Long Walter, James Neill, and Edythe Chapman are all listed as "extra". <br /> <br /> excellent film, but interesting to see the American propaganda at work.
