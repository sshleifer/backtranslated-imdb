The fourth of the five westerns directed by Anthony Mann with James Stewart features a breeder named Jeff Webster who drives his cattle from Wyoming to Alaska via Seattle. He meets in Seattle his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) that he sent in advance to prepare for the boat trip to the north. <br /> <br /> But first and foremost, he has to endure insubordinate track hands, deceptive river boat captains and the charms of the manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes that Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. That's why she hides him on the boat while the captain searches for the previous (and justified) killing of a trail. <br /> <br /> Jeff also has the misfortune to fall on the gloomy judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the city of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon jails Jeff for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle around town. He makes Jeff own his cattle and Jeff has to eat raven for the moment. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Jeff agrees to take over for Ronda until Dawson to deliver supplies. But it's just a trick for Jeff, Ben and Rube to return to Skagway and steal his cattle. Of course, Judge Gannon discovers the situation and is right behind, but Jeff retires with a rifle, while Ben pulls the cattle across the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. <br /> <br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another some other men from Skagway, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, who happens to be Ronda, who then quickly installs a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys a claim and starts looking for gold. <br /> <br /> But then, Judge Gannon goes to Dawson City to take part in the gold medal, and tells Jeff that he was getting bored with Skagway and he wanted to tempt himself his luck in the Klondike. . This involves bringing an armed man engaged and forcibly stealing some of the other minor's claims. Jeff and Ben now think it's time to get rid of the situation while things are going well, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They are looking for a way out only to get ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously injured, but that does not save Judge Gannon from his due. The shooting that ends at night in the muddy Dawson Street is doing pretty well. First, Jeff kills two of Gannon's best shooters (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then, while Ronda warns Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip behind him, Gannon pulls her on the back and she dies in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff kills Gannon hiding under a wooden sidewalk. The revenge has been pronounced. <br /> <br /> This is another heartbreaking western that stands out with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN OF LARAMIE. Why does the universal DVD use a pan-and-scan print instead of the big-screen print that TCM uses, it's beyond me. You will miss half of William Daniels' glorious cinematography of Alberta. So, if you like the well-written Westerns of the '50s, then this one is an outstanding caretaker. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
