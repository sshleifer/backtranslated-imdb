That's what I expected when Star Trek DS9 was created. Not too light DS9. It was a beautiful show, but it never really gave fans more of what they wanted. Enterprise is this show. While having a similarity to the original trek, it differs sufficiently to be original in its own way. This makes the exploration ideas exciting for us again. And it was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Relationships that have evolved between team members have also contributed to success. The viewers really cared about the team. Enterprise is also very promising in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I think that tensions within the company can lead to much more and say much more than is typical. I think that when we are dealing with such great characters of different races or species, we get very interesting ideas and television. We must also note the performances, Blalock is very convincing because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a fantasy and strength of character that offer excellent performance. The rest of the cast also performed well. My only complaints are the following. The theme. It's good it's different, but a bit too light for my taste. We need something a little bigger. Must not be orchestral. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. And my other complaint. They sell too many additions. They could solve this problem by selling fewer ads or by having all programs be two partners. Otherwise, we will end up seeing the show's final number end too quickly, as was the case with my complaint against Voyager.
