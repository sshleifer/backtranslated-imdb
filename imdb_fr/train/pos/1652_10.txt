This series introduced me to Deighton's writing and genre when I was younger and I love this presentation of the story. I do not agree with the comment above. From what I read in the past, it was not Holm's performance that led Deighton to refuse to publish the series, but the massacre that the three books were translated on screen. A good example of this is the rewrite of the border post that ended Samson's career in the field. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never inscribed in the book and the crossing at Sinker was from East Germany to Germany from West, not at the Polish border. This whole story is cloth. Changes made to Set affect the integrity of the story in the same way. My view of Holm's performance was that he perfectly described Samson's disorientation during the defection of his wife and, I believe, behaved well to represent the aging field agent desperately trying to reduce the division. Samson pays both for his father's idealism and suffers from his influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, if he had formed, he would probably have headed the department. I think the real loss of performance is due to the physical appearance more than anything. Holm is a diminutive compared to the book's Samson - a physically impressive man, able to use his size to impose his presence.
