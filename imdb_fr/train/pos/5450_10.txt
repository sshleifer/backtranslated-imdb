Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a shabby mining town. He also sells it to men. She escapes to New York and literally sleeps to the top. <br /> <br /> At first, I only saw the 71-minute version, but it's pretty extreme - for its time. Nowadays it's pretty tame. The film moves very fast and contains tons of sexual clues - some are as ridiculous (but fun) today. It moves so fast that you can easily ignore that most of these events could never happen - even in 1933. It's nothing conventional or monumental, it's just a quick and joyfully dirty and fun movie. . It does not fall apart until the end with a little "moral" end that the censors demanded. It sounds incredible and stupid (I saw it in a theater and the audience laughed at it - a guy said "Absolutely" rightly). I just saw the full 75 minute version that has another, somewhat tragic and MUCH better end. It was thought that this version was lost until 2004, when it was discovered by mistake! I think it's the only one in the version - but be aware. <br /> <br /> The acting game is good - Stanwyck jumps into his role and plays WAY on top. She makes you believe that she loves being cruel and sleeping. The beautiful Donald Cook and George Brent also have good performances. Also look for John Wayne, who is a front-runner, with hilarity as a moderate office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give him a 9.
