Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another Disney masterpiece. It was filmed with animation sequences and actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappeared into the art of the sidewalk.) I mainly notice this film through child's eyes because I had not seen it in years. At the time, it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict starting with the ghostly armor entering the battle) were my favorites. There was also a lot of stop animation used with the spells (ie, people turning into rabbits), which may be a little old-fashioned and ridiculous now. (Also, I think the movie starts slowly.) Through the eyes of a child, it's a fun movie and it's easy for children to put themselves in the children's shoes. It is an imaginary film that is unfortunately largely forgotten today.
