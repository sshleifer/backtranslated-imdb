I did not see BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the series but I could not get in there. However, I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday, I felt a little lost. So I decided to watch the pilot today and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I think that the series is promising and that the only side effect that has had on me is that now, I also want to watch BSG. <br /> <br /> But what I really like is that I do not have to be a hardcore fan of BSG to understand what's happening in Caprica. From what I read in the network, they were trying to reach the female population since BSG had touched many more men, and at least in my case, it worked. <br /> <br /> However, I suggest that if you try to watch the show do it from the beginning by starting with the driver.
