John Travolta, the world's greatest honkeytonk and a mechanical bull ... what more could you ask for! Yes, you're probably not going to have a lot of surprises or deep meaning in this one. Still, I have always found it quite enjoyable to watch this red feathered romance. Bud (Travolta) and Sissy (Debra Winger) meet at Gilley's and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you could expect from a couple of hardcore rednecks. The scenes of honkeytonk are fun with dancing, the mechanical bull and, of course, the fights needed. He has a good 1980s country soundtrack, with "Looking for Love in all the wrong places", "The Devil Down Down to Georgia" and "Hello Texas" from my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Take out your cowboy boots and get a boogie boot! <br /> <br /> *** (out of 4)
