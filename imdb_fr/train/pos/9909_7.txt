A serious comedy. The French version of the French play "Les Joies de la famille" (later Americanized under the pseudonym "A very rich woman"), produced by Ross Hunter, is opulent, well presented, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy California widow, who seems to waste her money, is guided by her two grown-up and avid daughters, fearing that Mama Rosie will negligently spend her inheritance. The whole question of a vital but old woman, sent against her will in a nursing home, and who will later have to prove herself sane in a hearing, is a sensitive subject for a comedy (and to her credit , director David Lowell Rich does not overload the photo with crass gags or an obvious feeling). Some of the humor is a bit wide and does not work, yet Rosalind Russell understands the seriousness inherent in this scenario and never strikes a wrong note. Sandra Dee is also a good granddaughter of Rosalind and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our seniors and how they choose to spend the time they have left, only the theme of "Rosie!" Almost lost in haste to a happy ending. The photo leaves you smiling - and at the same time asks you how many older women have never been so lucky. *** of ****
