With "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas of the fall of 2006. <br /> <br /> A superb cast, but I really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott ( the photog) and Hope Davis (recent widow of a journalist killed in Iraq). <br /> <br /> Apart from the acting, the writing was new and the actors play superb. The series was also shot in New York, in the real city, and not behind the scenes of Warner Bros. or another studio, which adds a secondary layer or realism. <br /> <br /> I guess people are more interested in the last "Survivor" and other problems of reality. Too bad it did not last.
