PG-13 rated for violence, brief sexual humor and addiction. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen Police Story a few times now. In my opinion, Police Story is Chan's best film in the 80s. Originally, it was He did it because he did not like the other detective film in which he had to play, which he called The Protector. I did not see the protector, so I can not compare. The acting is not so bad and the plot is pretty good.I do not know. I do not remember the plot, because I saw this movie some time ago, but what I remember is that this movie has a lot of activities, stunts and fantastic comedies, but that he needs a good movie Chan. If you can find Police Story and you're a fan of Chan, then buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Duration: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
