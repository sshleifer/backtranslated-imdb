A patchwork on 911. The 11 stories of 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (the first for example), sometimes used to tell Americans "we had more deaths than you and you supported the murderers" , sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really liked Claude Lelouch (the personal life of a New York couple, showing that our daily "problems" are not important), Shoei Imamura (odd, strongly anti-war in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, optimistic typical African despite the terrible daily misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the US policy towards the Arab countries). This shows that we (or they? I'm still Belgian but live in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and able to question the past and present actions of our government, as we should in a democracy.
