Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. He stays at the Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time, the big selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) is angry and refuses to attend the premiere of her new photo. In a state of panic, the studio hires Virginia (Rosemary Lane), an imitator, to pretend to be her and for Bowers to take her to the premiere, not telling him it's not Marshall. Naturally, they fall in love. You can pretty much understand the rest of the plot yourself. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to put it nicely) but Powell and Rosemary Lane are a very nice couple and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (underlined by "Hooray for Hollywood") and the director Busby Berkeley shows his unique visuals in a fun musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy performing his patented slow engraving). Glenda Farrell also has some fun elements as Monas's sister, Jonesie. <br /> <br /> Still, the film is not very good. The rest of the cups are ferociously molded and most of the humor is not funny. Lola Lane in particular is just ugly trying to try to play Mona for comedy. There is also racism - a stereotyped maid is played for laughs and there is a really dreadful racist "humor" at some point. This is probably what prevents TV from spending most of the time. I realize it was accepted at the time, but it sounds disgusting today. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a fairly average film that poses some serious problems, helped by good distribution and great songs. I give him a 7.
