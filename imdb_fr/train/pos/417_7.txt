This film features Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the villain who sells weapons to the Indians and you can barely recognize him. It was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next film was basically the same but shot in a different time. This film begins with the assassination of Lincoln and also deals with a war with the Indians. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and wants to stay at home. This film also deals with Custer's last fight and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and usually I do not like Jean Arthur but I liked him here.
