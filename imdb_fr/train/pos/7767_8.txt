Stack should have received the Oscar Award for this performance, that's all. It's a crime he did not do. Incredible how he humanizes a rich, worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone earned a well deserved Academy Award for her performance. In fact, all the actors in this film are excellent. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a taxi ride, then a plane ride, then continues on an emotional path that will always hold your interest. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a flagrant soap opera. Soaper one-dimensional to 100%. You could call it the ultimate soap opera, because acting so successfully triumphs over the material. Excellently played, well directed, but strictly in the genre of soap opera. I would not even call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Although you do not deny the great entertainment value of this movie, you can imagine what this talented cast and director could have achieved with more substantial content.
