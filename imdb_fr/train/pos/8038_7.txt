Two snipers travel deep in the jungle in search of their targets; A viscous South American drug lord and a general in sight. <br /> <br /> Moderate success in creating a sneaky atmosphere, Sniper is, according to most people, a very solid thriller, taking his time, establishing his characters, their difficult situation and their climax in good action sequences. The director Llosa does not always manage to maintain the dark mood and could tighten a little history; some detours do not do much. But this film is much better than his stellar / Stallone / Stone, The Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly tiring, is surprisingly successful as an inexperienced Sniper partnering with veteran Berenger. As far as Berenger is concerned, this film turned out to be his last big adventure in Hollywood with a big budget. He can play this kind of role during his sleep and he is very convincing here, taking it twice more directly into DVD suites.
