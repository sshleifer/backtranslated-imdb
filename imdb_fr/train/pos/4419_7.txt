I saw this film and heard writer-director Juan Gerard speak at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I knew was that it was the story of an eight-year-old film. Old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution of 1958 and its impact on his home and his family. <br /> <br /> His opening scene will evoke the "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: Roulette (Casablanca), "Chicken Glaucous" (Rebel Without a Cause), references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. The homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore that often uses a black man as a type of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is, is the culmination of a dream. Gérard's wish to honor his family and the medium of the film he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gérard and all the characters who are represented, as well as the events represented. Although Gérard is an architect and an engineer passionate about cinema, his dream was to make this film. He and his wife decided to live this dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believes in Gerard and agrees to produce and play in this film. Keitel holds the screen with force as mysterious grandfather and secret "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the distribution. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y Tu Mama Tambien) provide important support in key roles. <br /> <br /> The truth is, the first half of the movie has serious row delivery and rollover problems, but stay with it. The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the sweet-and-sour climax and honesty. This is Juan Gerard's first effort, but he is honest as he is and his passion and heart are really manifesting in this first sincere effort. I would certainly see him again and hope he will continue his career in the cinema. <br /> <br />
