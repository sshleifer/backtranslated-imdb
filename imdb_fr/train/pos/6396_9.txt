You think you had trouble? You should watch this movie. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a diver in the navy should inspire us all. And above all, after watching this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half! Cuba Gooding, Jr. is part of his best work so far as Brashear. De Niro, as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman, in his second feature film only (after "Soul Food"), has taken a leap forward as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you must absolutely check this one.
