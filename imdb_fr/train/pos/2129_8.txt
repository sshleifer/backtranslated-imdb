Sweet play / romantic comedy where Stewart and Sullavan write love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can not support each other. You can guess the rest. He is beautifully performed by the whole cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty and intelligent script and is absolutely beautiful. This took place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself thinking that I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dreamlike. A unique film of its kind. Do not miss it!
