I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this movie) at the time of its first publication and I was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his and the Amazonian people with whom he lived and loved) a way of living a decent life. His later books were not so powerful, but showed his continuing quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was well ahead of his time in the early 1960s, but his honesty and openness to it were welcome. This film admirably expresses the originality and generosity of man, but also gives a glimpse of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a moral term, in this case) when "civilized" men 'immerse in traditional societies. Even in this case, Schneebaum himself has entered into a kind of superior innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destruction.
