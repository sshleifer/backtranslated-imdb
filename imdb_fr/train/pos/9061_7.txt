I really liked the movie. I remember reading it many times when I was a child and I was happy to see that a film about the book had been shot. <br /> <br /> I was sitting for a boy and a girl of 11 and 8 years old and I had to talk to the girl to see the movie. But fortunately, in the end, she was happy to have seen it and even said that she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it was released. <br /> <br /> There was a good time laughing the movie was not as "disgusting" as I thought ... although it was high enough on the gross-meter ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can not understand This is the reason why they had to have the "Dilly" line that was made by Woody in reference to his intimate part .. it was for me the only shocking moment (and you could hear the adults in the audience panting at that time in the movie) ... I do not know why it was put in the movie; it does not add anything to the film itself, apart from the shock factor / panting ... apart from that, a very good movie. Nice to see the girl "Pepsi" grow up.
