My super girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me. I was really expecting a horrible film that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this film had so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that everyone could get a good kick. I know it was a very old-fashioned movie, but Uma and Anna were so cool and Steve was a great addition, with a great cast that seemed so fun and made the movie really work. Jenny Johnson (scary, this is the real name of my best friend) is not your ordinary librarian, when Matt, your average man, asks him out, he has more than that to what he expected, he asked G-Girl to come out on a date, the superhero of the world! But when he finds out that she's really a jealous and crazy girl, he decides it would be a good idea to spend time away, but Jenny will not get it because he fell in love with another girl, Hannah, and she will make her life was a hell, I mean, let's face it, he could not have chosen a better girl to break up with. <br /> <br /> The effect was corny, but you go over them quickly, the story and the cast made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie, it was a breakthrough of Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you should not really take seriously. It's just a cute romantic comedy that, if I could laugh at it, I think, everyone could. <br /> <br /> 7/10
