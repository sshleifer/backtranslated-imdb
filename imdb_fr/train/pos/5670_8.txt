Esther Williams gets her first role as MGM star and gets off to a good start <br /> <br />. This film is an entertaining and well-played thriller <br /> <br /> with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more <br /> <br /> in the future - an innocent girl harassed by a scary woman . Esther <br /> <br /> is beautiful and if she wanted to, she probably could have <br /> <br /> do more and better films, but according to her autobiography, <br /> <br /> almost stopped working for the wedding. Anyway, she's so friendly and engaging that it's fun to see her in a totally different role <br /> <br /> outside of the "musical comedy of swimming". Universal was fabulous for <br /> <br /> making movies with former MGM stars after the start of this <br /> <br /> studio and dropping its biggest names as it started to slide . <br /> <br /> stars like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others had the chance to make top quality movies at <br /> <br /> at Universal because they obviously still had the power to attraction at <br /> the box office. I wish Esther did more, but as she did not do it, <br /> <br /> makes it even more special.
