I saw the long day that dies at the beginning of its cinema release. I thought the film gave a good point of view of the soldiers, it gave a realistic account of men at war. The scenario moves at a good pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines and trying to get back on their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction, as is Alan Dobie (as German Helmut). I was surprised to find that I could not find this film on VHS or DVD, and I feel that it has become a forgotten film, which is sad because it is superior to many others war movies I saw.
