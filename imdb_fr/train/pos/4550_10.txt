Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor in the world. English aristocratic snob in A Room With A View, a passionate Irish thief in Au nom du p√®re, an impudent and violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a show ten times stronger than that of Adrian Brody in the pianist) and as that scandalous Cristy Brown has cerebral palsy in her left foot (to name a few). His roles influence each other, but each is separate and totally unique. It changes completely, with each character he takes. And I begin to believe that he can act like anything. Something. <br /> <br /> As a Cristy Brown, he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character and does not complain. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. An intelligent man. A scandalous man. Human. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its small errors of transition between scenes, is a source of inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No, I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that it is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is that of the restaurant, when Cristy discusses painters with Eileen, Peter and his friends. It is here that Daniel Day-Lewis reaches his peak. "I'll kick you in the only part of your animated anatomy." "Roll the cripple!" And his performance never slows down, never fades, and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of time on the screen here. I look at him again and I do not get tired of the insightful eyes, the nervous contractions and guttural speeches of Cristy. <br /> <br /> Must see. Fo sho, yo!
