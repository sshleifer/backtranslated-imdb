There are wonderful things in this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the right of ownership; she is wonderful in comic roles. William Haines could play, and you can understand why he was one of the most popular men on the screen. (Until a potential scandal forces him to leave the company.) <br /> <br /> The story is a little mundane, but it's handled so beautifully that you will not notice it. The leadership of King Vidor is one of the main reasons. The producer? The genie of the boy, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> This is about making a movie, and you can see the process as it was done in 1928: cameras, film sets, directors and actors. You can see (briefly) some of the main stars of the day; Even Charlie Chaplin goes around like himself, looking for an autograph. You can also see Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are otherwise names and old photos. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silences. , take the time to catch this movie when you can. It's really a fantastic time trip.
