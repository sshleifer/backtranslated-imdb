Deathtrap gives you a turn every turn, every turn. In fact, his biggest problem is that there are so many twists and turns that you never really get into the movie. you by surprise. The story is very good, apart from the fact that it involves so many twists and turns. The scenario is very good with very good dialogues and characters, but you can not understand everything because of the twists and turns. Caine's performances are amazing. Management is very good, Sidney Lumet can lead. The visual effects are correct, but most are actually in a room and are wrong. Too much, but it works and deserves to be watched.
