Congratulations to the authors of this film for creating an extremely engaging drama. The curious development of the characters is indicative of a nuanced and well-trained writing team. The audience member can not help feeling that he has to make heartbreaking emotional decisions between the brain and the libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the character himself, although his predictions are rarely validated. <br /> <br /> The credit also goes to the filmmakers who gave life to the decor. As the film unfolds, the wood shop is transformed into a unique personality, with its own traits, its faults, its very busy relationships and its destiny inexorably linked to that of the other main ones. <br /> <br /> Make sure to catch this one at your local art house.
