I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because it was advertised as a must see movie for those who love nature movies. The film shows different climates and animals associated with them starting from the North Pole and descending to the south as the movie progresses. The images in this film are often breathtakingly beautiful and I often wondered how on Earth they could have taken some of these photos underwater or in the sky. Although beautiful, much of the images I had already seen in the television series "Planet Earth", commented by David Attenborough. I found that Attenborough's narration of the planet Earth was much better than that of the Earth. "Earth" is an easier film. He omits much of the scientific detail addressed by Attenborough in his "Planet Earth" series. For example, the Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a humpback whale because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because its water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to feed very large animals, such as big sharks, etc. For me, it's an important difference. This, combined with Attanborough's much superior voice, makes Planet Earth a much better documentary than Earth's. However, I still think that the Earth is worth watching for these beautiful pictures and the fact that they are easier to understand also makes them interesting for children.
