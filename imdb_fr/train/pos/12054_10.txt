I saw this film for the first time here in the UK in December 1989, when the central television broadcast it. I still have the videotape, although it is worn out (over the years, many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been scared!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember going back home that night, taking a Christmas drink, turning off the lights and watching what was advertised as a "ghost story of Christmas". Even now, I remember some scenes that still make me think of hairs on the neck ... <br /> <br /> I've seen comments on the film that say it's neither this nor I think on Friday the 13th, these people are scared, and it's risky. It's a 'traditional' ghost story; there is no action with big budget or special effects ... no swearing, no blood, no free sex scenes, no chain saws, no guns, etc ... So , how refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. IF you like frozen horror, well written, well played and with a really scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; Just last night, I saw the original Haunting movie and it's a great movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is the woman in black. The end of the film differs from the book, but remains very good. I recommand it. Try it ... you will like it if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, turn on the fire, lock the doors, have a drink ... and enjoy ... :)
