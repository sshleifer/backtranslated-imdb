The implicit humor in the complete title proverb stems from the Sunday School saying that it would be better to prepare oneself before dying for the devil's inspection, ie the devil does not care about his death There is no percentage to try to defeat the devil. Apparently, the characters did not pay attention to Sunday school and found themselves forced to handle their crises after avoiding to avoid them. But even an experienced CEO would have difficulty managing these crises. Rolling dice is much more unpredictable than throwing a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than Sidney Lumet's long list of unforgettable films. So far, Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor, but here he was perhaps paying attention to his place among other Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino.
