I have seen this film several times on television. I ALWAYS look again ... NEVER turn the chain. This film is full of chilling surprises, and absolutely suspenseful, without being intrusive or stupid. The talent of Helen Hunt is beautifully demonstrated in this film! I recommend this movie to anyone !!!
