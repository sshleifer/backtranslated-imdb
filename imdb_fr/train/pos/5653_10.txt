It was an absolutely breathtaking series and I regretted that I was only able to watch a few shows very early in the year when it aired late in the UK. His style was so different from others of the same kind and the whole thing looked scary and confusing. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative I can see) to understand just how innovative this series really is and how it has hit the imagination. I understand now, reading the comments, that it has been CANCELED, it's so amazing. Which group of "overpaid headless and overpaid matched turkeys" had to (or maybe still might) run for it.
