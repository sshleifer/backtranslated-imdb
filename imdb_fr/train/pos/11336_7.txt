Answer: Despite the fact that this film was written and directed by a woman, your ex is scary, wicked and more irrational than any zombie that has ever devastated the Earth. <br /> <br /> The action in this independent film is pretty good, despite the less than wonderful script. It takes a good actor to deliver a crushed and clich√©d line and make it sound vaguely believable. The young Anthony de Marco, in the role of Jake, performs a particularly good performance. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the plot of this film is much better than the dialogue. Try, especially if you are not a monster fan. It's not a horror movie. Although all adult women are quite monstrous and all adult men act as if their brain had been devoured in a previous zombie movie, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for mature adults. <br /> <br /> All this time is much better than the sum of its parts.
