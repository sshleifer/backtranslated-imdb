Ah, real memories. I lived in Holland at the time and I was looking forward to seeing him every Sunday night and later on Tuesdays. I saw it during my 14-16 years. Very good for my English (at school time), because Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages, with the exception of children's programs nowadays. So, you hear the original voices and the language. - The best series were the first three and after the third series, the great character, Nazi Von Gelb, who was a formidable enemy, has disappeared from the show (I do not think they really caught him, he s' has always escaped, giving way to its reappearance in a future article), because it is obvious that the series has also been distributed in Germany and that a Nazi enemy would not go very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone did such a magnificent and convincing job in describing the intelligent Nazi aristocrat, obsessed by this permanent obsession with revenge on England. It was a real pleasure to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good match and the kids were so normal. They were very credible to me at the time, and as a child I could just imagine being one of those kids who were about four years older than me at the time. It was a very exciting series for me, but I remembered that time as a special series with "The Prisoner". I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series, that would be great. Even bad copies are always nice to watch. The last series were not as good, diluted and just as fun as the first three. Hopefully they will also find another DVD series with Von Gelb.
