It all begins with a series of seemingly unrelated robberies at a student hostel on Hickory Road in London. Worried about his sister, the governess, Miss Lemon asked Hercule Poirot to look into the matter. He agrees, but the stakes increase rapidly when a girl, who has admitted she was responsible for most robberies, is found murdered. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise, without being as complicated to numbness as "One, two, buckle my shoes". The murder, robbery and smuggling of diamonds are the crimes involved, and the last twist that unites everything is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially the psychology student Colin McNabb and the mysterious American Sally Finch, Inspector Japp has his funniest moments (this is perhaps the closest thing to "the humor of the toilet "), and Miss Lemon becomes more integral to the story than usual.
