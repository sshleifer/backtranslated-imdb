Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the United States. During the Second World War, the British plane Peter Carter (David Niven) was shot in action, but he survives. He meets and falls in love with the beautiful June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that an error has been made in heaven: he should have died! A French spirit comes looking for him but he refuses. He will soon plead his case before a heavenly court to be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> It sounds ridiculous, but it's actually an incredible movie. The scenario is good with the actors who play the roles with the face completely straight and with a beautiful staging - the scenes on Earth are breathtaking in Technicolor (I have never seen such a beautiful blue sky) and the scenes in Heaven are in black and white! Niven is sometimes a little stiff but Hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help Niven. The pictures are fantastic (especially the stairs and the last sequence) and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven meets a totally naked boy who raises sheep! It's an absolutely beautiful film that provokes reflection - highly recommended. This remains unknown in the United States, which is a shame.
