Yeah, it's nerdy, it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad either. He has Beatrice Ring which is a huge bonus, and it's fun. I had the chance to meet Fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about this experience because he was never completely satisfied with it. This is well worth a search, especially for genre fans and Fulci. It is a film that is too often rejected in an uncontrollable way.
