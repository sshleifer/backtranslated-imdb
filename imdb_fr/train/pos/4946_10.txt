Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor who searches for a character he is selected to play before committing himself. Freeman is a "good choice" for this film (as for "Driving Miss Daisy"), and he is not only credible, but he has the opportunity to change his image of playing a character with dignity and reserved property. While there is no guarantee in life, this gives an actor an excellent opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out in order to avoid stereotypes. And it must be said that stereotypes have hindered, if not completely ruined, a significant number of acting careers. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget movie that, surprisingly, was shot in just two weeks. . It's a film that is well done and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, California, for the film frame, which sets the tone and timing of the film. The editing is passable to good, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silberling was the "subcontractor", which forced Freeman to make this film, while the actor was between two projects. <br /> <There is good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, which opens an effective dialogue between each of the cast members, who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also promotes understanding between people who speak not only two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but who belong to two different worlds: ethnicity, race, sex, norms, customs, beliefs, traditions and principles. The film aspires to a certain honesty and reaches the truth in order to maintain the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> The comedy partly tells that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has been unemployed for four years. In truth, Freeman is such a sought-after actor that he is constantly working. <br /> <br /> The film offers an adventure of bonding, caring, sharing, change and exchange. And the film's outings give the viewer some insight into some of the things an actor has to go through to get ready to play a role. <br /> <br /> If necessary, tell your boss that you are participating in a "day of mental health". and see this movie If you can, take your neighbor or family with you. I rank the film 10 out of 10. It's nice, interesting, informative, poignant and useful.
