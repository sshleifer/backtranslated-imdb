FORGET CREDIBILITY <br /> <br /> You should not expect credibility with action movies in which the superhero must perform an endless series of incredible feats, walking in the process but recovering from the speed of lightning and transforming harmless gadgets into deadly weapons ... especially when Renny Harlin heads. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has many assets: breathtaking landscapes superbly photographed, special effects and visual breathtaking (the first five minutes are striking and set the tone of the film), an excellent musical score, welcome attempts to lighten a little tension, and solid casting: two heroes (Stallone, star and cowriter, holds the lion's share of the film, but the excellent Michael Rooker is more than solid), a charming heroine (Janine Turner) and one of the most crazy never seen. (priceless John Lithgow and Caroline Goodall of misleading femininity, but also Rex Linn - in a longer role than usual and who makes the most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Good solid entertainment then, if no credibility has been given. As Roger Ebert wrote another film) "This is the kind of movie you can sit and enjoy as long as you do not make the mistake of thinking too much." <br /> <br />
