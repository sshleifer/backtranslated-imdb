This movie is really great. It's probably in the 40s that Meg Ryan's character struggles to be called "smart". Plus, Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And everything in it has a magical feeling. Whenever I look at it, I feel happy. It's really a girls movie, and I'm a girl, so I like that. I also like music. The violin is great. but other than that, I think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it.
