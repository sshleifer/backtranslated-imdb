"The Color Purple", is really amazing. There is none like that, and I do not think there will ever be any. It is a feeling of emotion and pain that the spectator assumes. The actors are flawless and the staging is superb. I really loved that. A movie has never made me so happy. It's beautiful, it's the best way to explain it.
