It had been a long time since I had seen such a beautiful animated feature film. Having a healthy respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any other film made by them can not be compared to that. The animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are breathtaking, the background is breathtaking, almost every object is perfectly drawn in every image. Sometimes I felt tingling in the back - so much I loved what I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the plot of the animated film can possibly be. The characters are adorable, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he has pawns, rocks and rulers! The other characters are very nice too. Humor is first rate. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, it seems that creators have not invested much effort in this area. I mean, it seems like it did not take too much of a difference from Pixar & Dreamworks people trying to think of something new every time. And I am very happy that a product from a European animation studio has been so great. They made a beautiful and touching film, a sweet for the eyes and the heart. <br /> <br /> The only downside is a stupid start and that's why it's 9/10 out of 10 not 10/10
