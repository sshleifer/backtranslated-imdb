For me too, this Christmas special is one of those I remember very well. In 1989, I recovered the 2 CDs I found from the soundtrack recording, giving one to my sister and keeping the other for me. It's now part of my family's Christmas tradition and I wish I could see the show again rather than just remember it while I listen. <br /> <br /> It was also noted that John Denver had composed several appearances on the Muppet Show, and they did more than one special stage together. The good connections between Denver and his fuzzy companions are clearly visible here, in a charming and entertaining show that is suitable for all ages.
