Tressa's vocal performance was outstanding !! Tressa played the role of singer while Richard was in the club. When she first came on stage and began to riff and strut, it made my soul tremble. His voice is platinum. She has to make a CD. She has more fans than she realizes. I loved her performance in the five heartbeats, which she also featured with Leon when she was younger. How can a little girl have such a big voice? She is really amazing.Good voice good good good good voice voice voice excellent voice voice fantastic voice, back tremor, tears of tears, exhilarating, bring you back to the voice of days. Tressa, if you read this commit, follow my advice and start recording a CD. If it's not just for the sake of singing, but for your fans. I think you can really do it. Look at these other successful studio singers, lol.
