I saw this film without knowing what it's all about ... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more of his Shakespeare films, and at first I only saw it for that ... and I finished with tears in my eyes, because the great, great serenity, values, affect and courageous philosophy about the life of Helena's daughter. Recommended for people who are bored with television programming (in Spain, at least).
