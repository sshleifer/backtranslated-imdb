I saw this movie in the first few weeks, it was out (I do not remember exactly when). I thought everything was fine for a film by Ben Stiller. This film is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about it. Or as I said, you have a good sense of humor. From a few people on this website, I saw that people had nothing good to say about it and they did not get a very good grade, but I would have given a bigger note to this film. well and it should have been better noted. Maybe it's not a movie for you. I am only giving you the opinion of another person.
