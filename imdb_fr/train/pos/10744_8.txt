The events of September 11, 2001 do not need additional human interest to follow the training of the novice firefighter or the progress of the two French brothers. In my opinion, it would have been better to leave that aside. I think the directors did their best, maybe they felt that the events of the day required a story in the background. The comment of one of the police - "it's not fucking Disneyworld" is appropriate. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is interesting to watch for the representation of events. The filmmakers were in the right places at the right time, no other sequence of the day matched what they shot.
