Lillian Hellman, one of America's most famous playwright women, was a woman with a mission. His opinions on the left were not well perceived at the time in the country. In her memoir, she recounts her trip to the Soviet Union at the time, intrigued by the alleged success of this system. "Look at the Rhine" must have come after these years. The American left, like everywhere in the world, had a problem with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe, but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> "Watch on the Rhine" was a play produced on Broadway eight months before the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. Mrs. Hellman announced the entry of America into the Second World War. The adaptation is to the credit of Mrs. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, his long-time companion. As directed by Herman Shumlin for film, the film was well received during its first appearance in 1943. <br /> <br /> The Muller family was introduced to us at the opening of the film. They cross the border between Mexico and the United States. They must continue to Ms. Muller's home in Washington, DC, where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a minor celebrity hostess. The Mullers, we realize that we are fleeing Europe because of the persecution against the opponents of the growing totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we thought, in a way, that the Mullers could have been better justified if they were Jews, fleeing a certain extermination. <br /> <br /> We discover that Mr. Muller has had a terrible time in his homeland, as well as in other places because his outspokenness has denounced Fascim. He hardly knows he's coming into his mother-in-law's house, which is home to one of the worst representatives of this philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film offers an excellent acting game. It is a piece of curiosity because of the supporting role of Bette Davis. Paul Lukas, who repeats his role on Broadway, is quite convincing as Kurt Muller, the honest man who wants to create a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does an excellent job of interpreting Kurt Muller, repeating the role that has made Broadway. <br /> <br /> The other best performance is Lucile Watson, who plays Fanny Farrelly, the matriarch of this family. . Geraldine Fitzgerald is performed by Marthe de Brancovis, a Farrellys guest, married to the despicable Teck of Brancovis, a Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods and the rest of the cast support good performances guided by Mr. Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should recall the evils of the totalitarian regime, no matter where.
