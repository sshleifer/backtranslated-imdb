I am a sucker for movies like this one. Films that take you back and allow you to relive your childhood. I am an adult now and I have a lot of responsibilities like a mortgage, children, dogs, a woman and many others. I enjoy my life but she is not as innocent and carefree as when I was twelve. The Indian summer of Mike Binder knows it and explores it as if it were twelve years old. This brings you back to a time when life was simpler and a lot more fun. This brings you back to a time when you were worried about your first kiss and wondered if you could finish the camp marathon, which was an important issue. The Indian summer is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen at least once a year to laugh and remember ... and remember. <br /> <br /> The film stars Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton, Diane Lane and Matt Craven (to name a few) are childhood friends who are summoned again to Tamakwa camp by their former chief counselor, Uncle Lou. Uncle Lou is perfectly played by Alan Arkin. He is a type of guy who is the patriarch of the group. He is also all-knowing and embraces the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. He has trouble understanding the children of today who need a walkman when they are in a place of immense beauty like Tamakwa. It is a camp in which the moose walks in the camp, leaving the colors attributed to it by God and the water as far as the eye can see. Uncle Lou aspires to the old days and asks his former campers to return to the camp to see one of them take charge of the camp. Although they are together again, we see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love could be born between them. <br /> <br /> As the adults return to camp, they will soon behave like children again while the camp's typical jokes are still played. They take out toilet paper from the stands, put toothpaste on sleeping bags, etc. All this is hilarious and with actors like Pollak and Paxton, all this is very fun. <br /> <br /> But beyond the hilarity, we have the opportunity to explore real adult emotions that everyone can understand. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins overlook a bay where they used to canoe. Pollak can not seem to understand how small everything looks and Perkins finally tells him that the bay has not been reduced, but enlarged. It does not hit home, but it does it subtly. We are all growing, we are all moving forward and unfortunately we can not all live as we did 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they stay the same. <br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a character-driven film and is beautifully written by Mike Binder who actually attended Camp Tamakwa Camp (as did Sam Raimi). played Stick in the movie) and it is his loving and lively memories of his experiences that fuel the film. There are many touching scenes and there are many as hilarious. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I love everything and it's a real hidden gem. <br /> <br /> 10/10
