I saw this film when it was released and I have since cherished it. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find that casting is one of the most interesting aspects of a film). Really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always funny. The script is clever, sneaky and ironic, mocking almost everything "Beverley Hills". I loved the "doctor" of Paul Bartel and the servant of Ray Sharkey. It was torrid and raw, but thank goodness! Unless you are prudish, I highly recommend this movie. For those who like playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were in "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together in "The Night of the Comet". They were all three in "Eating Raoul".
