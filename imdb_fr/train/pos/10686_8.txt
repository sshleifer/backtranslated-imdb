And I'm a fanatic of Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see her and hear her read the Moscow phone book, which she might have known when she spoke Russian in this movie. <br /> <br /> The four main principles are excellent, but the film itself contains a number of good pictures and better scenes held together by nothing. <br /> <br /> While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this one asks the viewer too much. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (which is partly) or rather scary (which is the case in a scene), but the director did not seem to know what direction to take.
