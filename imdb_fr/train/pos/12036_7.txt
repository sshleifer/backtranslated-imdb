Why am I so convinced that there is actually another cinematic version of this novel somewhere? I saw the film again this year as I was teaching the novel and I found the changes in the film annoying - there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the end has been changed. They kill him in the movie, but the fact is that he is haunted by the events at Eel Marsh House for many years, but he remarries and ends up putting the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in the film where Kipps fires the office is all silly, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to indicate the presence of the child is truly frightening but useless - Kipps is haunted by the woman in search of revenge, not by the child. I'm sure I saw a better movie, closer to the novel and more scary. Have I just imagined that?
