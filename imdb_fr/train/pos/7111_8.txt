*** SPOILERS *** Among the first films of the Second World War out of Hollywood that show how the war affected these GIs, or in this case the US Marines, who fought there. <br /> <br /> Al, 21-year-old Schmid, John Garfield, was just starting to live with a well-paying job that brought in about $ 40.00 a week at the local steel mill and a daughter, Ruth Hartley, Elenore Parker that he was about to marry when the Japanese ruined everything. Millions of young Americans, too, attacking the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. As an American citizen, Al immediately joined the United States Marine Corps in the hope of returning to the Japanese, knowing, as it should, that the Marines would be the first US combat units to tackle them. . /> <br /> Al finally had a chance when his unit, the 1st Marine Division, landed on August 7, 1942 in Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, on the far reaches, to confront the Japanese who controlled it. It was during the Battle of the Ilu River that Al nearly ended a massive Banzai attack in Japan, holding with his machine gun, wave after wave of suicide attacks committed by determined Japanese, until help or reinforcements finally arrive. It was during the bloody war that Al was hit in the face by a Japanese grenade that had finally blinded him. <br /> <br /> Back in convalescent states in a naval hospital, Al is facing a much more difficult problem to overcome. then fight a battalion-sized attack of Japanese or German soldiers. He is facing a future where he will never see again and who will have to rely on others to care for him or him! <br /> <br /> We have the chance to see in the movie "Pride of the Marines" Al Battle himself much stronger then he made the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal just to accept his handicap. Not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to feel sorry for him. Al is actually the one who is sorry for himself more than anyone else in the movie. With the help of Virginia Pfeiffer, the Navy Nurse, Rosemary DeCamp and Ruth, as well as his fellow US Navy member, Lee Diamond, Dane Clark, Dane Clark finally has the courage to face his blindness with the same strength he faced, wave after wave. Japanese troops on Gudalcanal. A courage that Al thought was lost in this hell of God in the South Pacific. <br /> <br /> According to the true story of US Navy Sergeant Albert Schmid, "Pride of the Marines" showed what we expected among tens of thousands of wounded US soldiers coming back from the war. We see how much more difficult it is for those fighting the war to adapt to an America in peacetime when they leave something, as in the case of Al Schmid, on the battlefield. Al's battle with his personal demons was much harder than that of the Japanese, because they were part of him and therefore had to fight themselves to defeat and defeat them. Despite the help of nurse Virginia and his girlfriend Ruth, as well as his Navy doctor, who looks a lot like actor Gregory Peck, it still belonged to Al to defeat his fears. Fears that he and he alone had to fight and conquer at the same time, as everyone said in the film, all alone.
