The best film about marriage and the family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples who will be brought into the fascinating, dangerous and paradoxical world of marriage and family. This decision could be the best or the worst in our lives and in that of our children. The real intrusion or the help of the "friends" - or the hangman if we leave -. The true role of families: they can help or destroy us. The crazy priest who is probably not very crazy saying what could happen according to the statistics and the reality. A couple who thinks about a "special" marriage lives a painful story in their own story. <br /> <br /> Who loves contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells his own story ?? if they leave the future in different hands, if they do not know WHAT IS MARRIAGE. That the problems are true, that life requires a real commitment, guarantees, from everyone. That the real victims of divorce are children, with the real name, Andrea in the movie or names. That abortion is only an easy way out: sadness, regret and misfortune will be there after the abortion. That the state and the social security think less every time to the real problems of the families. The gossip of "friends", the infidelity because of the weakness and despair of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, deep in their heart, they love a beautiful marriage and a beautiful family, otherwise, Why do they like marriage? A true and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: of each of their decisions, of each of the actions of their life. The family can be a place where everyone feels loved because he is his only existence. The scenario is beautiful. The performances are excellent: Steffania and Tomasso, the almost cynical priest! Excellent direction and script. The colors and the management of the cameras, superb.
