Yes, that's what I think. Of course, it was always a big show with John, but I personally think it's much better without it. <br /> <br /> I love having CJ and Grandpa living at home because they are so fun together. <Br /> <br /> When John was still here, I was not laughing as much as today. <br /> <br /> It's a pity not to make any more. (I do not think so ...) because I would love to see new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. poor Rory is almost always left out. It's always Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY !!! ??? Honestly, it's a great show and for all those who have never watched it, you have to watch it. I almost guarantee you'll laugh. even laugh.
