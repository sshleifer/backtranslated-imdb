I saw this film in 1969, during its first release at the Cameo Theater in South Beach, today the famous Crowbar Night-Club. It was the last year of the '60s and this movie really hit the house. He has everything; the generational gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success and the conflict between following the "traditions" of the family and seeking one's own path in life. <br /> <br /> It was a very fast film and very nice. Vegas was at its peak, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs, conflicts, love stories and even a happy ending. A very good time on all. <br /> <br /> The poster of this film is based on the wall of my room. I look at it and go back in time; a moment of my youth and my time with my father, a great moment in my life.
