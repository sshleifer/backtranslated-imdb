I grew up in Brazil and I used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the film was shot. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Green Coast" of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings to life the sixteenth-century world of Brazil, where Europeans were just beginning to explore the coastline, which was still sparsely populated by various indigenous tribes. French and Portuguese fought for the territory and for the timber trade in Brazil, while negotiating with the natives, who also fought for some reason. <br /> <br /> An unsuitable Frenchman ("mercenary") is left for dead by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is held prisoner by an entirely naked indigenous tribe. While he is a "slave" to the chief, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months, until the time has come to kill him and eat him according to a ritual of revenge. <BR /> <br /> What I like in this film is that it reproduces with love the villages of the natives and their way of life (they walked naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept the life of those times. it was: in a beautiful garden of Eden, life was chaotic, violent, full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs. Europeans arrive and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There are no "wild nobles" romanced or heroic explorers, it's just people trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The film is neither unduly sympathetic nor contemptuous for the natives. From what I know about the subject, the description is quite precise, which adds a unique touch to the project: how many films have you seen about the lives of Brazilians and their first relations with Europeans?
