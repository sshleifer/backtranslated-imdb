I do not know why the critics ransacked this movie. Anyway, I almost never agree with them. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been a little scary - I do not usually go to horror movies! I even had to scare myself to see it by day. I did not need to be disturbed! ;) (The cinema was full of kids, huh !;) ... Liam was great as always. I also loved Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /> <br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful in a phantasmagorical way. The special effects and sound were great. I also loved the score, especially Eleanor's soft melodies and her journey to save the kids, the way she came out of her stagnant routine and life, and finally gained her power, peace and freedom. .
