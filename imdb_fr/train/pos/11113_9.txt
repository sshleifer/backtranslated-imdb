I only watched the first DVD series, but I would summarize The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a scenario similar to Tarantino. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (so not a "10"), and far better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there is a lot of action, some quite bloody, the story is centered on the characters. Even some of the minor characters contribute to great stories. for example. the relationship (or lack of) of the priest with Carmilla and the restaurateur's wife, and Christopher and his friend dimwit (who did not last very long (Darwin Award nominee?)) <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot, the scenario and the acting, the other reasons that I liked; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music 3. This shows that anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
