Before Nicholas Cage was a big star of action, he was a great actor. It is in this less known film that Cage gives one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low-budget movie, almost unknown, but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I found him walking down the aisle of the video store and I wanted to see Cage and Hopper (who is also awesome in the movie) appearing together. Go get this one, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
