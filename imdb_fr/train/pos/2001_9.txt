I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big screen movie in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later, in the summer of 1969, I had the pleasure of seeing that this film was still being broadcast in a leading cinema in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Oscar for best film of the year former. <br /> <br /> The success of "Oliver!" on the stage and on the screen reminded me that not all talents start on Broadway and do not end in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English speakers, was admirably presented on the London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His charming musical becomes a success in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967, and then published in 1968. The sets and the musical numbers are staggering. The song "Who will buy?" Hundreds of actors and the British director really deserved his Oscar for organizing everything in a transparent way. Some Canadian and American talent is also part of this wonderful production, but it is above all a tribute to the quality work of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good show! Other studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also offered the world many films to cherish over the years.
