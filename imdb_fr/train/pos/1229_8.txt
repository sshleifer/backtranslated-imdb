I waited for centuries to see this because all the reviews I read about it said it was horrible! I rented it expecting the worst, and although it is not the best film of Sandler, there is much worse! Sandler often talks to the camera and the film does not take itself seriously, but that's part of the fun! A great way to lose an afternoon, and you might even find yourself laughing every other time! A good movie, which is worth renting!
