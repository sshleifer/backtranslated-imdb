Having seen this as a previous spectator by accident, I watched it twice now. I really enjoyed it, no silly idea to provoke messages, just good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and just a good movie. Highly recommended for those who enjoy movies and do not dissect them. A great pleasure for the whole family here. I did not know that Rosie Alvarez was played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sensual. The songs like One Boy and One last Kiss are really nice to listen to and you stomp to Jason Alexander is the total contrast to his character in Pretty Woman and is very good. Tyne Daley remains etched in my memory to Cagney and Lacey. His voice and his accent always carried this memory. Overall, I just liked it and I will try to buy it if it is available
