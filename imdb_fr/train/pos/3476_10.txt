At a Glance: If you're a baby boomer, you've inevitably wondered if in 1976 McCartney had the good idea to interfere in the life of a hermit in the city of John and spend the day with him. You have also wondered how things were going. I heard the same reports as the author of this film, from the point of view of John and Paul, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in the same way as this film does. But none of my imaginations could have brought tears to my eyes as this incredible piece does. I found it incredibly realistic, perfectly plausible and 100% saccharine free. Can anyone explain why I did not hear about this masterpiece before it was broadcast by CBC last night? I mean, he's already three years old, for God's sake! And yes, if you're a fan of the Beatles, it's a must-see! Even the subtle paraphrase of Beatles melodies in the background is inspired.
