"Citizen X" is the true and beautifully told story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it happened; the Soviet Union in the 80s. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** ** <br /> <br /> Viktor Burakov (beautifully portrayed by Stephen Rea) is a newly-promoted forensic investigator for the militia of the Rostov region. He discovers past and present unresolved murders, apparently by the same person. The murders have not been solved because no one has ever bothered to properly investigate the evidence. He is brought to find and stop the killer. His only tools are his dedication, his skills and his honesty. Its obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourage the search for truth. His naivety would have led to a failure without his leader, Colonel Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to handle the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring a murderer to justice, even though the party's official line is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" <br /> <br /> The distribution is remarkable. The places and the scenery are perfect reconstructions of the Soviet life of the last days. The score of Randy Edelman is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon, both intense and poignant. It was a movie specifically designed for cable by HBO Films and they have become an excellent resource for movies that would otherwise never be shot.
