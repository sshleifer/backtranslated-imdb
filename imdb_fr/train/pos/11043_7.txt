Malefic has almost everyone seen the viewer from start to finish with his nervous atmosphere. Almost the entire film takes place in a prison cell composed of four characters, among whom the transvestite Marcus and his belated boy are the strangest. Soon, detainees find a former detainee's diary behind a brick that deals with his obsession with occult themes and dark magic leading to his escape from the cell. From there, everything is done to unveil the secret of the book and his escape spells in prison. This leads to accidents on the exit of the cell in the unknown light. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think the story is rather poor and that the final turn is nice, but for me, the ends are pretty closely related. Anyway, I was delighted until the last moment because the atmosphere of the film is unique with minimal decor and distribution. The victims are raw and strange ... it does not take gore to cool your spine and the occult themes are also very well done and remind me of Hell's themes in Hellraiser. Malefic has a claustrophobic and dirty cold feel with a greenish hue. Sometimes you wonder if the real or occult world described here is a stranger. When the retarded boy loses his fingers and falls asleep sleeping while sucking on Marcus' breasts, it seems normal that the glowing doors of freedom are strange. With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and thrills the viewer in a very different way from most genre shocks. I just wish the story led to a more consistent finale. Several elements, such as the visitor with the camera, the obsession obsessed with the books for the detainees and the toy doll that is pointing vaguely towards the end do not correspond to reality. Anyway, I'll keep an eye on other films by director Valette, although it's an unfortunate desire to see that he makes a Hollywood remake of "One Miss Call" that was already useless and useless in the Miike version.
