First of all, I must say that I am Portuguese and that it is not usual to spend my time watching Portuguese films, probably one per year or none at all. <br /> <br /> And the reason is the almost generalized idea among the Portuguese that national images are awful, very close to the worst ever! However, in the last decade, it's beginning to surprise me when we find the funny drama of the 40's when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were among the best in the world of their time, with films like "Pulsação Zero" or "Sorte Nula" by director Fernando Fragata, but also with some actors and music in common. <br /> <br /> This one is also good, not of the same kind because it is not a real comedy; in fact, it's officially a drama, a woman drama that features fun and unexpected roles, humorous characters or hilarious stories, like the hypothetical trip to the Caribbean just to get fucked. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us several times; actors are good, regular places like partition; but the truth is that all of this makes sense, so we can count it as a great effort for the national cinema, which seems to start from the ashes like the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese Film movie, you can surely choose a better option, but there is still one to measure.
