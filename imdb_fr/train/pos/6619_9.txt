Blade Runner (Deckard is a replicant!), <br /> <br /> The City of Lost Children (meaning increased or whatever is used and abused and most of the time well, giving us far less than we we could dream), and <fr /> <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> You really have to add them. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I was waiting for an animated film that could affect me as much as Miyazaki's business. This one is the first. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of that. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love-hate relationship with the film noir and, hey, if you do not go, it must be mostly love, right? But there are so many science fiction and black themes completely immersed in this film that it's just a wonder to watch. <br /> <br /> These people did an amazing job!
