The plot does not begin to describe the film: a man is writing a film, or rather, * this * film. It's totally self-referential to the point that you think it's going to fall back on itself like a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It's very philosophical, like "Waking Life", but more oriented towards Zen and, in fact, much better, in my opinion. At some point, there are interviews with people in the street, then you see shots of these people being filmed, and then you find that their answers are written as you continue to scan his lines. There are beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope that the DVD will come out so that I can see it again more carefully. Seen at Cinequest (San Jose Film Festival, California) on 25/02/2002.
