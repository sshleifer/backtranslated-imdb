This 1947 film was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and features beautiful Rita Hayworth with short, less attractive blonde hair. So, I've already been to Orson in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the third man, etc., but that was my first interaction with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting went well. She does a remarkable job of playing Elsa, fear and anger, married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her, she does not know if she can live without the things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband and partner bicker, just like the sharks Mike describes attacking and his predictions are just as true. This mystery of murder has many twists and turns as we reach the climax of the entertainment home. (Think of the final shooting in The Man with the Golden Gun, who borrowed a lot from this scene). I did not know who the murderer was until the end. <br /> <br /> This film is like a shrimp with garlic and lemon. The dish is centered on the sea, it is subtle, acidic and spicy, all having a remarkable effect. These may not be the best fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The tasty sauce adds natural shrimp when you're stocking up on healthy, but nutritious alternatives to more ordinary and ordinary dishes. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
