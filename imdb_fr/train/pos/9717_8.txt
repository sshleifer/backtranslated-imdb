How to lose friends and alienate people is, in all honesty, one of the best comedies I've seen this year with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of those "crude" comedies that relies heavily on pet jokes and toilet humor, but moves at a brisk pace and you'll be easily attached to the unfolding narrative. Simon Pegg puts his finger in the coffin with his hilarious portrait of a character out of the water and quickly detaches himself from the tripod to which he once belonged in England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting to the top of the Hollywood food chain is hard to do, as we can see with Pegg. His first contact with the lead role was David Schwimmer's comedy Run Fatboy Run, but he has received mixed reviews from critics and the public. His second try is this movie, got pretty positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office. For my part, I still have not lost confidence in him and I will always be there every time he wants to take this third shot for glory. <br /> <br /> The other characters were well chosen in the casting of Jeff Bridges until Danny Huston. Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst has, in my opinion, resisted well in this film as an angle of love for Pegg's character, however, the spark that I saw in Interview with the vampire is still lost. She needs to find it quickly, otherwise she risks forever the consequences of her loss in the country of "Roma".
