I found it a bit difficult to follow, so much so that he seemed to dive in the middle while I was trying to find out who was fighting who and why. One of the problems is that of culture and language. We have here a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we do not know and because we only read English subtitles, we inevitably lose some of these subtleties. Another problem is that there seems to be too much twists and coincidences. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that there is a totally bad movie about Miiki and that's certainly not it. A lot of stylish and unrestrained violence, a window on some less orthodox sexual acts and the family aspect. All in all, it's a decent ride, but maybe taking a look at the story might be helpful before looking at this one.
