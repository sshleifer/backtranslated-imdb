Lily Mars, a little girl living in Indiana, dreams of celebrating on Broadway. His aspirations take off when Broadway successful producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries hard for Thornway to notice her, but he gets angry at his antics. When Thornway returns to New York to stage her show, Lily follows (John's unknown of course) and Thornway finally gives her a small role in her next show, solely as a favor for her family. However, Thornway begins to crack for this girl and a romance blooms, which makes Isabel Rekay, the main woman in the series, jealous. When Isabel gets tired of the John-Lily romance that caused friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she has returned to her small role in the room, which could also compromise the romance. A very charming movie and a refreshing change to see Garland put his comic touches into his role (his reading of Lady MacBeth, though supposedly funny, never threatened his career as a singer). I liked more the character of Heflin (Thornway) when he was angry Lily rather than being romantic. The film became somewhat predictable and the scenes were not assembled as well, but a very nice movie. Note, 7.
