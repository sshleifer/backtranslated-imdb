Wonderland is a fascinating film about the involvement of renowned movie star John C. Holmes in the brutal murders of Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The promotion of the film misleads the reader into believing it is a romanticized portrait of the porn industry in the Boogie Nights ve ve and this is not the case in fact.In fact, with the exception of a few references made by reporters to reports that John Holmes is a porn star and a short life-time montage of John Holmes, this film is strictly dramatic about the involvement of a fallen celebrity with the murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is deceived, it is really engaging. The playing quality of all the actors is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to go down. all the ways of John Holmes. I was completely convinced that I was watching what John C. Holmes looked like and was probably acting in real life. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of John C. Holmes or if you like stories about Hollywood then I think you'll love watching Wonderland.
