Otto Preminger, finishing a series of black films at Twentieth Century Fox, has brought together his leader "Laura" for this serious and difficult crime drama. Dana Andrews again represents a policeman, but this time he is hardened, cynical and accused of police brutality by his superior: "You do not hate the hoods, you liked to beat them!". Mark Dixon (Andrews) scorns criminals, his father being a crook. He does not want to be "Sandy Dixon's child," so he became a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hated. <br /> <br /> One night, after investigating a murder, he unknowingly hits a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard it kills him. Shaken Dixon does his best to hide it, in order to encourage a hated thug, Scalise (Gary Merrill), for the crime. Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), Paine's father-in-law, whose daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is separated from her husband but continues to be drawn into his games of chance. Paine had slapped his wife and enraged his father, who had come to his son-in-law's apartment, but not before Dixon's departure with his body. Without any better suspect, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Guilt-laden, Mark falls in love with Morgan and offers money to a lawyer. He still decides to attack Scalise but leaves a letter to the department in case of death, confessing everything. In the end, he can not live with knowledge with what he has done and he allows the letter to be read by his superior and by Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes his love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this film on DVD, after so many years of televised obscurity. Eddie Mueller, a film noir historian, comments and does a good job, but I found that the audience would not understand the importance of casting the lead role, since "Laura" was made six years ago. In this respect, he is mistaken because they had appeared in "The Iron Curtain" two years before WTSE and the film had been a box-office success. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney were fabulous together, and Ruth Donnelly is a huge comic relief as the owner of Martha's Restaurant, fanning the flames between the detective and the lady. <br /> <br /> The nocturnal cityscapes give the film an air of threat. Gary Merrill is great as a little man, Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("Your father loved me," he taunts Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are also excellent. And Tom Tully is just touching and funny as a member of the pop wrongly accused by Morgan. <br /> <br /> A black film to watch with a fantastic cast.
