****** WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ************** <br /> <br /> So who are these "Mystery Men?" In simple terms, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-heroes who are desperately trying to live their fantastic teenage lives while screwing up both their true identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works on construction during the day and at night, leaves his wife and children at home while crisscrossing the street in search of crimes to fight with his extraordinary shovel fighting style and unique. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to the newlyweds during the day and throws dishes at the night owls, if his mother does not keep him busy with the last weasels. Mr. Furious works on a junk yard to earn his salary, then avoids his frustration at his friends at night, throwing badly crafted tokens at friends and enemies and threatening to get really angry . ?) Ben Stiller breathes such a life into this character that he can not help but love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights trying to capture the "moment of glory" they dreamed of ... becoming a reality. Super hero. Obviously, this could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all ... a super-policeman who steals and beats with enough corporate logos on his suit to stop one or two more bullets. Greg Kinnear performs a remarkable performance as a middle-aged soldier trying to capture the attention of his fans at the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring back this "extra magic" that could once again take the honors, C.A. releases Casanova Frankenstein, an excessive threat of WAAAAAY played to perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This whimsical genius created a "psychofrakulator" to turn Champion City into a reflection of his own dementia ... and ended up capturing C.A. within hours of leaving prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with henchmen such as Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need a boost. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who started out as the only talent on the team, with his bowling ball a mystic apparently animated by the revenge of his dead father; the invisible boy (Kel Mitchell), who claims to be invisible when ABSOLUTELY nobody looks at him; the spleen (Paul Reubens), who received a mysteriously powerful flatulence from an angry gypsy; and the very underutilized Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut the weapons in half with his mind, then passes much of the rest of the film to cast riddles and demonstrate too much wisdom. <br /> <br /> This film is really an intersectorial adventure. Anyone looking to classify films into small, tidy categories is fighting a losing battle. It is a parody / parody of the superhero genre - pseudo-Burton sets recycled to infinity (and sometimes decorated with more parody) to ridiculous costumes, the genre of comics receives a very good rendering. But at the same time, it's also a serious superhero movie. Both of them. Although it is not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film is a kind of reflection of D.C. Comic's short film, Inferior Five), it is quite innovative for the big screen. It offers the world of comics that demands a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws into the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know that, if the superheroes were real, these guys would be too . If the Big Guy with the S flew in New York City, you would see half a dozen reports on idiots in underwear that are kicked buttocks regularly. Of course, the Shoveller fights pretty well and the Blue Raja launches the forks with great precision - all the elements of the superhero world. But does that make them real superheroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This film is also a comedy, although dark. Inevitable, trying to emphasize the ridiculous and patent nature of the superheroic. One-liners fly when the comic geniuses on stage throw many elements to play on. Janeane Garofalo's dialogue with her father / bowling ball is particularly wonderful. However, it is not a comedy in the sense of brilliant laughter or eternally memorable jokes. He mixes a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never ventures into a game. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie, in the end, is that it is very engaging. Good weak / lame guys are finally justified and, for a brilliant moment, really become superheroes; justice is rendered; and the film ends with a scene that breathes realism (as realistically as possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, it can become a deluge. <br /> <br /> Of course, no film is perfect. Claire Forlani is as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious's love interest, although she has a central role as a conscience. Tom Waits seems somewhat baffled by his own ideas as a crazy inventor, Dr. Heller, although his first scenes, which bring retirees back to a retirement home, are worth watching alone. And the villains are only armed lackeys (what is in question in the film). Cinematography is agitated and disjointed (as in the average comics, so it's excusable), the music sometimes takes over the landscape and the special effects are never very well integrated with the rest. <br /> <br /> Yet, overall, this movie is amazing. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really enjoy this movie, but it's a crazy pleasure and a good way to kill a few hours and let your brain rest. <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
