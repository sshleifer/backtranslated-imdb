I have not seen this 1958 movie for a very long time and I really appreciated that Kim Novak plays the role of Gil Holroyd, a witch and an aunt, Queenie Holroyd, who is also a witch and Gillian also has a brother warlock , Nick, played by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian stares at Shep Henderson (James Stewart), who is betrothed to a girl he is going to marry. Gillian interprets some spells with a cat and changes her mind about her wife, then becomes very eager and falls in love with Gillian. The story goes that a real witch can not fall in love with love, blush or cry, and that starts to be a big problem between Shep and Gillian. Nick and Aunt Queenie have decided to do something to remedy this situation. Great movie to watch again and again and a great classic movie of 1958.
