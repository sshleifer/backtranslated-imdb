If you liked Deep Cover, you may also like this movie. Many of the poetic interludes recited by Fishburne in Deep Cover are excerpted from the lyrical lyrics of "Once in the Life," an on-screen adaptation of a play written by Fishburne. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie entirely in Larry, all hot and flesh-and-blood. Of course, there is the use of firearms and illicit substances, it's a gangster movie, after all, but the screenplay is beautiful and the story is touching, even a little bit about girls' movies. <br /> <br /> Amazing movie ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you sneak out at night or in a clubhouse, you'll have the impact of cramped sets (resonant metaphor being trapped in life). Filled with intelligent and complex relationships, this film is tightened..all feelings are reflected in the scenery and shots of the camera. GOOD WORK!
