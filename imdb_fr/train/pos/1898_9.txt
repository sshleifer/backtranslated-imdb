The father of Who's drummer, Keith Moon, was called Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this film. Liza Minelli, who is used to OVERACTS, did a great job in this match and managed to silence Dudley Moore every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John absolutely stole all the scenes. It was a very "different" film, allowing the viewer to get a glimpse of another life. We often try to catch a replay of this satellite movie. God rest Dudley Moore; it was such a nice movie. A lot of satire and congratulations to the rich and the snobs / rich. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is rather endearing.
