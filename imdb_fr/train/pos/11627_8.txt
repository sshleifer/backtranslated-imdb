Lisa is the manager or owner of a hotel and she flies to Miami. She ends up sitting next to an assassin named Jackson who tells her that she has to change rooms in a family or that her father dies. The reason she has to change rooms is because Jackson wants to blow her up. <br /> <br /> This is an awesome thriller because Lisa is trying to escape from this ploy Jackson has put in place. The story is fantastic and I thought they could have spent more time on the plane. The plane could have more, but other than that, the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the end because it was heartbreaking. I did not know what was going to happen and it surprised me. For me, this film has just taken off.
