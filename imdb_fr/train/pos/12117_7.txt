Although this film put Davis on the map because of its brilliantly intense performance as an illiterate waitress / prostitute of guttersnipe, Mildred Rogers, this film is strangely unsatisfactory for me as a whole. The game of actors is indeed in almost all areas. What I can not understand is how or why Phillip, a sensitive and well-behaved young man would accept the constant abuses that this vagrant is constantly inflicting upon him: I find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in some respects. Yes, I know that he is an introverted intellectual and sensitive to the feet in the legs. But Davis is such a venomous witch that no one who has been cultivated will tolerate her attitude or actions and make her credible. Davis is stunned in her role: yes, she can go from time to time in her crazy movies, but it's a very creative representation, no matter how you look at her. Too bad she does not play the role of a gangster. His character would have been completely credible as a tramp among the little lives!
