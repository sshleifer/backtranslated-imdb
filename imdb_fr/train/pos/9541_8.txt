Wow baby, it's really a beautiful Asian horror / gore and a weird and bizarre movie. It's a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little Tetsuo, except that in this case, with all the blood and guts, there is a weird love story. It's hard to imagine how they even imagined this breathtaking movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into a partial machine or, I guess, into cyborgs. The only thing that is wrong with these creatures after they take control of a human is that they need to kill each other and eat each other. hmmm, yum yum It would probably be called industrial splash or something like that, with a great soundtrack to add to all the fun. The film also borrows some of Carpenter's "The Thing" in the design and effects of creatures. I would put this in the category of must-have for the gorehounds, because there is a carnage without stop and very good gore. And inevitable for the brave, because you do not even need to read the subtitles, the images are not enough on their own. The design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminds me a bit of Frank Henenlotter's films, which is another tribute to great gory films with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is a real pleasure for gorehounds, no question, and I just loved it.
