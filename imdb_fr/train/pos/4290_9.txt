I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best artists in the world. I do not understand why some people say that it is not. Boring .... ??? Maybe the one who said she is boring is because he / she is boring. She is an excellent actress and the film was excellent. He has many wonderful ideas and very good interpreters. The management was great. I imagine myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and fragrance, flowers, churches, problems, etc. When she goes to the sister's store, it's just amazing. Everything is fine. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I love him more than in his next film SCIENCE OF DREAMS. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
