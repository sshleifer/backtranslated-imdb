I loved this film. It was almost the same as the first (lakeside hut), but instead of just killing women, it also kills men. And the scenes are much more interesting, two of my favorite scenes are first, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he describes the last moments of Kimberly before she was thrown into the water, and, secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in her basement just before they go down on the plateau when she kisses him. These scenes, for me, have been very intense and captivating. I gave the film a score of 8/10, not because the film was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean, there were times when you noticed that nothing was wrong, as if it were shot like a film shot, you would not see the filming "live" of the camera, but then, very little, you would notice the shooting errors. What did not go well?
