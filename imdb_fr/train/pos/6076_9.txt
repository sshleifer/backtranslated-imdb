... or did the honest Iago really smile at the end when he was dying? <br /> <br /> I loved the fact that the iambic pentameter from the Bard had just rolled Fishburne's tongue with great clarity and emotion. <br /> <br /> And how did Branagh make Honest Iago seem to celebrate his own misfortune ... <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I often thought that Shakespeare was not cleanly film-friendly: He uses words to create images in our mind, which creates a perpetual battle with the camera, who knows only us show what we need to think and feel. All efforts to film Shakespeare must really be celebrated. It's not an easy thing to do.
