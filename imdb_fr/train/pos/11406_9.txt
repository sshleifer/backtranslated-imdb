This very special decoration of Wagner's last opera definitely grew in me. When I saw it for the first time, a lot of movies about surreal images got on my nerves a bit and I felt that too much was superimposed on the story. However, if you can handle quite a lot of "tricks" that you're looking for, you'll find that the movie does not capture the weird and strange atmosphere of the opera, and that there are some particularly good moments. <br /> <br /> Personally, I never really understood Kundry's role before seeing how Edith Clever described her. Her performance (a synchronized mime of the lips of Yvonne Minton's sung voice) is dazzling from start to finish and alone justifies the hours needed to absorb the film. <br /> <br /> The pleasure in this film is that it captures Robert Lloyd's dramatic portrayal of Gurnemanz's crucial role played by Lloyd in opera houses around the world. I had the privilege of repeatedly enjoying him as Gurnemanz on the Metropolitan Opera's stage, and the beauty of his voice and the warm and paternal tone of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved, as well as as his portrayal in the character's two major monologues, the Karfreitag scene and the story of prophecy in Act 1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a video made for America, and so there were subtitles that, alas, could not be eliminated. This is all the more regrettable as the translation used is very imprecise and imposes an extremely Christian interpretation on a film that already imposes layers of interpretation on opera. This seemed to me quite contrary both to the clear dismissal of Wagner's Christianity and his very deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of history. (See the footnote with aileron at the end of this article.) I find it almost impossible, when viewing a movie with subtitles, not to absorb them, and strongly recommend, if in DVD versions, to be able to activate the subtitles. That's what you do. If the opera is unknown to you, read the booklet carefully. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there are a lot of things in the movie that I do not like, and that I would not like As soon as I saw it do it differently .. but, in my opinion, this has steadily increased over the years, and I found myself compelled to enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Footnote containing a spoiler: A good example would be Kundry's famous phrase: "I saw him ... him ... and I laughed." This is translated, in the subtitles, for reasons that escape me, like "I saw the face of the Savior". This annoys me particularly, because throughout the booklet, Wagner makes a very deliberate reference to this invisible character who MUST NOT BE BIBLICAL. Jesus is "der Heiland", that is, German for "The Healer" - a reference to Amfortas's wound, and all wounds and diseases and the need to heal.
