I'm definitely not in the target audience of this movie. I am a man of about 50 who has only recently stumbled upon the world of independent film. This happened quite accidentally, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks, late at night, on television. The first two things I noticed about this movie were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local newspaper and said that one of his influences was the employees, I started to be interesting. When he said that his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I had seen on DVD a week ago, I decided to go see that. The result could be described in the same way as the clerks, although both films have nothing to do with the content. Both films suffer from technical blunders that are overcome through amazing writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is a man's which, apparently, forces itself to be constantly busy. run one way or another, filling his life with little things so he never has to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. Looking at it, I can say that little has changed since I was growing up, young men still have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, creates wonderfully honest characters, and asks them to do quite credible things. As far as independent film is concerned, that may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic point of view it's very close.
