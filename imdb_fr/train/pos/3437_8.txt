Some genre films must be dressed. This one was an exception. Taken on its own merit, it's a disguised version of the horror genre movie. With minimal special effects, this is a kind of psychological study, with a simple but existential theme: who is hit by the bus and why? It's not a good movie, but the story works great. Subtle and all about the interactions of the characters. In fact, there is a device in the early scenes, but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what will happen. I very much appreciate the balance between the energy of men and women and I would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the film if you have a little empathy, value the need for adventure in your life and ask yourself "What would I do in this situation?"
