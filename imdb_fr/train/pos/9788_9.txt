I was at the same scriptwriters conference and saw the movie. I thought the writer - Sue Smith - summed up the subject of the film very clearly. However, the movie really did not need an explanation. I thought the themes were very clear and inspiring. A film about the ability to dare, to deal with fear - especially fear transmitted by parental figures - and to overcome it and, in so doing, to grasp the possibilities of life, is a film to cherish and savor. I enjoyed it much more than the very popular "Somersault". I also think that Mandy62 was a little mean to Hugo Weaving. As a guy about his vintage, I should look so good! I agree that a lot of Australian films have been dull lately, but "peaches" delivers the goods. I'm glad I saw it.
