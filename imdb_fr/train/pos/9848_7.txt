I watched this movie with my child's eyes and I was not disappointed. The story is well known, an abandoned silversmith must be brought to his parents by an improbable trio (mamooth - saber-toothed tiger and a lazy animal) ... its nutty. This one made me laugh a lot throughout the photo. <br /> <br /> In short: it works, it's funny and it's a must with your children (it will please them).
