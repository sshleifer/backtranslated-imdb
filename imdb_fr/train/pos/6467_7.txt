Two consecutive films dealing with Indian prisoners of war; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara is a love story featuring a guy who gives everything for someone, Deewaar focuses on the main subject himself. It is not hidden that many Indian prisoners of war have been rotting in Pakistani prisons for years - for whom neither the Indian government. has the time or the sympathy neither of the other side. I'm sure some Pakistani prisoners of war are also in India, but let's focus on the film. Many actors. Some were actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of major, played well. Akshaye Khanna did a good job. Amrita Rao had nothing to do but a few laughs and a few songs. I think Sanjay Dutt's role was the strongest, though not too long. He did very well here and his dialogue performance was equally impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was just a one-day movie with a story going all over the place (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-done film that keeps a good pace and does justice to all the actors. 7.5 / 10
