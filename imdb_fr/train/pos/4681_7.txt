Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to independent film lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to emphasize the similarities between parts of this film and those of Nichols. One scene in particular, in which Adrian Grenier's character questions Rosario Dawson's sexual life in his absence, is remarkably similar to that of Closer Owen who questions Julia Roberts, although she is interpreted with less harshness and intensity in "Love". Also note that "Anna" is the name of the character of Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and so-called on Arthur Schnitzler's film "Reigen", so I'm not sure how this connection came about. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
