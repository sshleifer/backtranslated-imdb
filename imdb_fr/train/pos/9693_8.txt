I was very surprised by this movie. I was touched by the lives that Paulie lived throughout his journey to find his "marie" the little girl from whom he was separated. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story, as I thought. In fact, I was expecting this movie to be hurt by jokes about "Paulie wants a cookie", but it was done in a very humorous scene that becomes very touching when Paul is in the press conference of the lab. research. So, if you want to see a good film "animal talking", take a look, much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprise twist in the end which is also very good.
