Branagh and Fishburne offer excellent performances in this version of Shakespeare's classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I have seen the character played in a movie or on stage. Some might say that this movie is too focused on Iago, but I do not agree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in the history of cinema, displays a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as a Moorish Venice can be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encounter with this film is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. The character of Desdemona has much less depth than in the play. In this film, it could also not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film is the subtraction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she is incarnating in this film. A number of subtractions have damaged the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the play or seen a film version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, whether cut or not, remains incredibly captivating. The acting of the actors, as indicated previously, is very good. If important scenes had been added and the character of Desdemona had been prioritized a little further, it would be a very good movie. As things stand, it's still an admirable version of the original. I give him a marginal recommendation.
