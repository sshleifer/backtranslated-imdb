Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career, but he has surprisingly little merit in his name, including real misses such as the non-funny Cold War satire The Day the Fish Came Out. Iphigenia, however, is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from Euripides' play, this is a superior rendering of classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in the United States courtesy of Flix Channel. The film is shot on an epic scale, but it is definitely not a "big" film, the emphasis being on the simple story: to beg the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his girl Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou), to the consternation of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both remarkable, but it is the amazing Papamoschou who brings to the screen the most interesting elements, mixing the innocence of childhood with the emerging awareness that she is the pawn of a political game. Highly recommended for international film fans.
