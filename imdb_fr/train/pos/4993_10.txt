Unfortunately, this film has been unavailable for a long time (as other posters have noted), but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching love drama unfolding in a slum. He presents performances of Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young who are almost the best of their career. This is a striking example of how director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost magical aura around elements of poverty, crime and horrific social inequality, proving how much his talents were really romantic and spiritual. This film shows how love survives in the midst of his misery and desperate needs and affirms his life. It is a true masterpiece of this period and it is a film that deserves to be better known.
