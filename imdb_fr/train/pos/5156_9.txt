I agree with many of the negative reviews published here, for reasons I will address later. But this mini-series is powerful and convincing, because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of Hitler's world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as Ernst Rohm, the brutal leader of Brownshirt. Every scene he has with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is so perverse that he dominates everyone except the primitive Rohm - and he digs it clearly for that reason. The interaction between Stormare and Carlisle illuminates how Hitler savored Rohm's brutality, but then sacrificed it for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone turns into a heartbreaking performance in which Geli Raubal, the convicted niece of Hitler, victim of his indescribable perversions. Without revealing any of the sexual fouling directly, Jena Malone plays all the horror of the slow extinction of a girl's mind. She uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horrors that will affect millions of people in the years to come. And she's great! Zoe Telford almost corresponds to Jena Malone with her performance of Eva Braun. Eva is clearly sick, cruel and heartless - but at the same time, she almost pitifully depends on Adolph's twisted tenderness. The aborted love scene that separates them (alluding to the tingling truth of Hitler's enormous abomination) is both terrifying and erotic. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber gives a delightful, weasel-like performance as Putzi Hanfstaengel, the indestructible man in the city who is seduced by Hitler's promises of wealth and power. While a brute like Rohm loves the idea of ​​crushing his skull under his boots, Schrieber's character is one of many Germans who hate Nazi violence but can not resist the fast, easy way to the world. money and power. His weak desire for Hitler quickly made him lose the respect of his wife, played with style and sensuality by the astonishing and royal Julianna Margulies. They provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal. <br /> <br /> These performances carry the mini-series, easily overcoming the occasional weaknesses of the scenario. There is an exception. Unfortunately, the acting talents of Matthew Modine are simply not up to par. His evil, evil journalist ruins every scene he has - the viewer is eager to wait for Rohm's red blouses to crush that fair, fair look of his ignorant, Hollywood Hollywood face. But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now, with regard to the factual inaccuracies of the screenplay - Hitler's perversions and cruelty are rendered in the form of a vibrant and compelling drama. But Corporal Hitler's record on the battlefield is badly distorted. As if they feared that the public could not bear the idea of ​​evil and courage in the same person, the writers give Hitler the face of a cowardly weeper who "prayed" for an iron cross. As if someone in the Kaiser's army could get a medal by lamenting it! The film suggests that Hitler was a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless soldier. They also suggest that his comrades despised him, when in fact he was widely admired by the officers and men enlisted. The depressing thing is that the mini-series was so good at portraying Hitler as an honest monster - but she just could not resist low-end shooting. <br /> <br /> In total, however, Hitler: RISE OF EVIL is a dazzling success highlighted by powerful performances.
