Does anyone know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stack could have been a Masseratti character. The Rock Hudson character told his father that he had a job in Iraq, is not that right? I had Dorth Malone in my spanking bank almost all my life. Maybe it was the film that impressed me. Loren Bacall had some cuts in this film and probably surpassed Malone, but Malones' share had a more sensational impact. Was Loren's role considered a main role? The old man Hadley's character was probably a fairly common image of the tycoons of his day, as he was an ordinary guy who had succeeded in the emerging industry, but all over the city he had forgotten his children so his wife At the end, being a widower, he realized that they were all he really had and that they were rotten spoiled in search of attention, so rather than trying to tell his kids, he made them jump his head off.An old tale of morality.But seriously, what were these sports cars?
