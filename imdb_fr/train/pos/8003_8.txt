This film is an excellent entertainment to watch with his wife or his girlfriend. There are lots of laughs and very interesting little nudist stories happening here. The actresses are all very interesting and deserve to be watched in their natural beauty. Life at Maslin Beach is full of nudists and diverse personality types. The landscape of the Australian coast is simply beautiful to see. What a place to visit, to say the least, and one day, it may become my refuge. I really enjoy this movie and every time I look at it, I appreciate it more. I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what they have become. Although the plot is a little soft, this film is, of course, a great excuse to sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin Beach with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
