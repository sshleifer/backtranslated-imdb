there should be in the West a subgenre called "Robert Mitchum's West". Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic and generally underrated Westerners import his film noir character to engrave sketches of dark characters and bring a more familiar elegiac lassitude to Sam Peckinpah's films. 'Man with the pistol' is one of his best. Directed by Richard Wilson, protected by Orson Welles, it is a thick monochrome beauty, full of frightening silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of wild violence, while Mitchum comes to tame a city terrorized by a monopolist with an army private. Mitchum's regression from a soft-spoken murderer to a disturbed murderer, with a host of dark emotions in between, is an expressive and physical gaming wonder.
