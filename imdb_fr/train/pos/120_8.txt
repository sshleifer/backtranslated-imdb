It's not the job of every film to stimulate you superficially. I am going to take an ambitious failure on a mass market success everyday. Although this can not really be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This indecipherable quality pushes me to watch it again and again. It is a provocative and provocative film that does not summarize everything. The problem with the film is in its structure. His insurmountable plot seems to be coming to an end, just like a second end. Although everything is technically dazzling, the movie is exactly too long for this unit. The long, late climax of Leo's awakening comes 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> An excellent cinematography is often at the expense of a decent scenario, but the innovative technique of the camera offers a multitude of visual ideas. The artifice of composition is provocative and engaging; A character is thrown back, but his own hand in the foreground is not. The world represented is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes open for a memorable and surprisingly technical assassination that will make your jaw drop. <br /> <br /> The compositions are stunning. Anyone who chose to release the video tape (out of print) in pan & scan format never had to see it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that anyone can give such a criticism to this originality. You should see it at least once. You have the impression that von Trier has bitten more than he could chew, but this film ends up being richer. I suspect he knows foreign correspondent Hitchcock well, in which perverted Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles films that take as much pleasure as him in the technique. All of von Trier's films explore the tragic fate of the naif in ruthless societies. After Zentropa, von Trier has moved away from this kind of daring technical experience in favor of a dreary, overvalued and unsophisticated sap like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
