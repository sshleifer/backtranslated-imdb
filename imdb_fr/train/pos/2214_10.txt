My family returned to New Orleans in the late 1700s and, watching the movie, I knew it was a story my grandparents had never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have obviously black cousins, African-Americans and others who can "pass" in white and have chosen not to do so. It's a hard story to watch when you realize we're talking about your family and Cane River is part of that story. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the buttocks of my great-grandfathers who own these plantations and marvel at how my great-grandmothers of African origin lived under this existence. at once oppressive and aristocratic ... Even if I did not go out of this story, I would probably not be the successful businesswoman that I live today with success in a relatively integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair, it depended on the actor, but it's a film that you NEED to do. Anne Rice is amazing and I wonder why she writes "symbolically" on my family and not me. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
