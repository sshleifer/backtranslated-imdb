Although Urban Cowboy did not sink with the same testosterone that could be found at a rodeo, it provided a precise insight into this era in urban Texas. I also think that in order to really criticize this film, it would be necessary to have lived at the time and the relative place where it was shot. There was good music, moments of pleasure and, yes, some "frolics" at the honky tonk truck stops. The relationship between Bud and Sissy, like "two ships that spend the night," was well designed. When Pam tore up the note Sissy had written to Bud, it recalled the tragedy of many real-life novels. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the actors and the team had done a great job. I thought the game on the screen was well written and done. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
