Girlfight is like your grandmother's kitchen: the same old recipe you've tried millions of times, but it's been transformed into something new and fresh. Try to explain the story to people who have never seen it before: a young woman on the wrong side of the trail tries to improve her situation by being boxed while facing a bitter and obstructive father and a growing attraction for a rival. Watch them rolling their eyes in front of the rosary of pictures, and they are right: it's a clich√©. However, I was hypnotized by the quality of this film, by his often superb acting and dialogue and by the delicate direction that makes him "new". I avoided that in the movies because it looked like shit, but do not make the same mistake as me. It's really worth a look.
