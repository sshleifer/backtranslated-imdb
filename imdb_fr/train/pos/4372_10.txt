Rob Roy is an epic of passion and underrated action! Liam Neeson plays Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best of his career. Jessica Lange is perfect as his wife Mary. They have the most passion and chemistry I've ever seen in a couple on the screen. John Hurt gives his Best aristocratic arrogant performance. Tim Roth portrays one of the big bad guys on the screen. His rape of Mary is disgusting and heartbreaking. He is truly a gorgeous bastard in this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best swordfights of all time. Scripted and scarred Well, and the direction of Michael Caton- Jones is flawless. 10 of 10.
