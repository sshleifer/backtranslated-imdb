I just saw The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it pretty good. It was the first appearance of George Sanders as Saint, replacing Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this one, the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting in a nightclub. With the help of his friend Inspector Fernack, who has come down from New York, they help a girl from a crime leader. <br /> <br /> Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale join Sanders in the cast. <br /> Not a bad holy film. To have. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
