I just saw this movie today with my children (10 year old son and 4.5 year old daughter) at the 3rd annual Roger Ebert Overlooked film festival. After the film, the children of the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director, Tian-Ming Wu. Through a translator, he told several stories about his life and the making of the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from the tangencies, my two children really enjoyed this film. Of course, I had to paraphrase many subtitles for my daughter, but much of the film is visually explicit. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything, but the result is that this movie is so much better than 95% of Hollywood shit (especially children's movies) out there. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> ps There is a "real" / original king of masks that can / can do 12 masks at a time. The actor in the film formed and learned to make up to 4 masks at a time (then they cut and changed into 4 new masks).
