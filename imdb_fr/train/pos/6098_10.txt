This is a TV show based on a horror movie that does things. Friday the 13th, the series has no connection with the movies. The legacy of Poltergeist: I'm not so sure. It may have been poorly connected to the cinema. It feels as if they have just launched a famous title on a show for fans to watch. <br /> <br /> This shows Freddy being burned by the Elm Street parents (in the first episode, I believe) and the disappointing number of parents. With all the kids he targeted in the first 3 movies, you'd expect there to be more parents. But OK. <br /> <br /> Freddy is essentially the narrator of the series. He observes the actions of people in the real world sometimes get involved in one way or another. As in other anthologies, like Tales from the Crypt, there is a supernatural touch or a surprise ending. <br /> <br /> The actors' game is missing but believe it or not: the violence sometimes exceeds that of the film. This show lasted two seasons and was directed around the 4th film. I heard that it was canceled due to a protest from parents. I watched a lot of R things when I was a kid, so it's a pity the parents spoiled it for everyone. 4 more movies came after the show, so it was not a total loss.
