I have watched this movie over 100 to 200 times and I love it every time I watch it. Yes, it can be very cheesy but it's also very funny and enjoyable. The camp shown in the film is a real camp that I attended for 7 years and is described as the camp, a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who has ever been to the camp, who wanted to or sent a child to the camp should see this movie because it will bring back wonderful memories for you and your children.
