Surely one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best movies ever made. Scenario, cinematography, staging and play in a class of its own. This film works on so many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Never shown on TV? Why is he hidden when he is regularly presented at the National Film Theater in London in packed halls?
