I loved watching this movie. I recorded it watching so I could see it later. In fact, I enjoyed the second viewing more, because I could absorb more of the intelligent dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought that the way this story had evolved was very provocative. I was very intrigued by how Natalie would interact with her daughter's friends. At first, it seemed she was going to vomit a lot of animosity, but once she started to interact more pleasantly, I had to see how this visit was going to unfold. I was not deceived. Little by little, the secrets that Sara hid from her mother began to reveal a less perfect girl, an imperfect human being, like most of us, who wanted her to be liberated from a domineering mother who thought she knew her daughter but who unfortunately had to learn very painful way that sometimes to really love someone you have to give him his freedom. Spectators who watched the movie to the end saw a very touching performance by Diane Keaton (who is always wonderful, even in some of her less well-received films - think Town and Country). The last scene of Diane Keaton's drive was well worth the wait, revealing that whoever loves another human being must learn that we must live our lives, love others, but do not own them and ultimately we must leave go. This is a difficult lesson, but one that needs to be examined from time to time. Thank you CBS for this show, it was worth the wait.
