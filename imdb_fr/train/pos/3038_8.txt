Since Douglas MacArthur has touched more human lives - for the better - than any other unelected American President, he deserved a better film biography. "MacArthur" from Universal is not bad. It's just not what it should have been. <br /> <br /> Curiously, the potential was there. From the very first episodes of "Star Trek" "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the recent HBO movies "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO4), director Joseph Sargent appeared as the One of the most expressively human Directors in the film, a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional nuances of his actors' performances and transporting the audience exactly where he wants it. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (1970), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films, and Universal widely touted the fact that the film had "four years of preparation and production". Yet for all this, "MacArthur" is perfectly adequate - and not much more than that. <br /> <br /> The film begins in early 1942, shortly before the besieged general was commissioned - by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) fled the Philippines to avoid being captured by the Japanese. Thus, this film omits: <br /> <br /> · The birth of MacArthur in 188O in an Arkansas border barracks, still subject to attack by Native American tribes - thus establishing that his remarkable life extended from the bow and arrows with thermonuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · he graduated from West Point, first in a class of 95. <br /> <br /> · how he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who had deserved the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge during the Civil War) in Japan, China and, especially, the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · his heroic exploits during the Vera Cruz tour in 1914; <br /> <br /> · how he jumped into the trenches of the First World War like a mountain goat, often wounded, and blazingly promoted to the brigadier general; <br /> <br /> · his post-war service as the youngest and most progressive commander of West Point; <br /> <br /> · his participation in the court martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /> <br /> · his run of the Bonus Marchers in 1932; <br /> <br /> · its efforts to maintain an underfunded force within the army in the early 1930s; <br /> <br /> · his retirement from the US Army to become the Marshal (!) of the Philippine Army; <br /> <br /> · and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the beginning of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> All this is omitted in favor of a long sequence of MacArthur trying to defend himself seasickness while being evacuated by boat PT ?? thus, we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not why; Nor can we understand why the allegations of cowardice were so hurtful to "Dugout Doug" ?? and so manifestly unfounded. <br /> <br /> The rest of his career is for now very simple: he jumps to the islands "Hit 'em where they are not" campaign, fulfilling his commitment to Filipinos? "" I will return! "? His supreme achievement, the victory of peace in post-war Japan, then the divergence of opinion with President Harry Truman (Ed Flanders, truly fiery) on the conduct of the Korean conflict that resulted in his finally, his proclamation to Congress that "old soldiers simply disappear", after which he did so.Historically accurate, and all presented with a deliberate lack of comments. <br /> <br /> Sargent and the producers go away almost painfully from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur's actions seem noble, let them be presented as such, if they seem selfish or bombshell, let these designs take their toll. without comment As Joe Sargent is expert enough to subtly manipulate the reactions of his audience - again, see Warm Springs - this refusal to make a comment appears rather intentional. Historically, this may be commendable, but it almost annoys the spectator's efforts to place this extraordinary man in a rational perspective. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a kind of "done for nothing". feel the film, as it is at "Midway", released at about the same time. Both films were relegated to "television" directors - Sargent in this case, Jack Smight on "Midway", and both have a look made for television. Even Jerry Goldsmith's walk, while perfectly usable, lacks the subtle nuances and grandeur of his "Patton" theme - another way a man larger than life is commemorated by a very ordinary movie. <br /> <br /> There was a vanity and a smallness in this man, undoubtedly; there was also greatness ?? and to love or hate him, one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military leader had done before: he won the peace. <br /> <br /> Finally, "MacArthur" "like so many movie biographies" is a good place to start researching this remarkable man, but a poor place to end it.
