Listening to the soundtrack of the moment, the images come back with a vivacity that makes very strong my desire to dry eyes (to be able to tap this one). I've seen him twice before now and I should be ashamed to have seen him * only * twice. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa who was, even in the version not cut, too premature compared to the manga nec-plus-ultra). Nevertheless, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to become too na√Øve / positive (Chihiro) or, with more nuance, a little too explicit / moralistic (Mononoke). At least, compared for example to the other master Ghibli, Takahata (Tomb of Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one. <br /> <br /> In Laputa, Miyazaki tells the story of the brilliant story told and perfected by storytellers over the centuries, combined with a touch of morale and a sense of transcendence. atmosphere, but also with the humor and fun of Totoro for example. Each main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts, fears and qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The rhythm is so perfect that I know nothing except a black hole that could exert such an attraction on your whole being. The story looks like an action movie evoking mysteries, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone and the main theme comes into play, you have a glimpse of the great mystery that you are about to reveal. , but the story then settles and gradually, on a number of scenes of action and serene beauty carefully chosen, ends on an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, after days of gloom, to finally see the horizon on a beautiful morning, knowing that the road was walking, seeing the way to go, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to glimpse it. <br /> <br /> It's like a bright white light in your skull When the credits begin to roll, you have dry eyes and your mind numb, you should see a therapist. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that, from a technical point of view, some more recent Miyazaki might seem more painful, I remain his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a split second to realize that this was done in 1986, you can only conclude that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star who only appears once every 200 years. Of course, this has already been suggested, but for me, it is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate this simple fact. If you miss it during your lifetime, you will die with a huge void - which would be a shame, because the coffin costs the same price.
