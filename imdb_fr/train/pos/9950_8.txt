Very nice action with an interlaced story that does not really fear. Interesting enough to deserve to be watched instead of jumping to get to the right parts. Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere also helps to animate her. Jenna in this sweater and these glasses is just staggering! It's worth it to come and see her!
