Hidden Frontier is a show made by fans, in the world of Star Trek. The story unfolds after Voyager's return from the Delta Quadrant. He has some characters from official Star Trek shows, but most are original. The show is based on Star Deep Space 12 and several space ships, giving it opportunities that official shows do not have. The characters have the opportunity to climb the hierarchy, which is not the case of the characters in the shows with a single ship. The show has a good computer animation of spaceships, but the acting takes place in front of a green screen and gives a green glow around the actors. Not all actors are so good, but most are fine. The episodes are character-driven and develop over many episodes. It's a bit more like Babylon 5 than most official Star Trek shows. Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series no longer has to use. Overall, I enjoyed watching it.
