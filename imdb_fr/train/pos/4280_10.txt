The group of people travels to Belgrade in a dreadful bus, driven by a drunk driver and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is often interrupted by many hilarious events that describe with irony the fall of the national spirit in 1941 and are so amusing that they are still used today as jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a peasant four feet tall with his four sons almost twice as big as him. In the end, the film takes a dramatic turn and the trip is no more than a swan song of a dying country.
