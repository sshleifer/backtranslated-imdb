It's an Arnold movie. Now that you know that, I saved a lot of you the time it would take to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, then you will not like this movie. If the case is the other, then you will most likely like it. It's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> Now, if you still read this, I guess you like Arnold. Good for you! He's pretty good, does not he? Running Man is a very typical feature of Arnold. The B-Sci Fi of the 80s, he has the usual retro-future, a bunch of terrible one-liners, a lot of violence and explosions, a beautiful heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <In this case, the evil opponent is the 1984 government, which controls everything, and uses television as an effective means of controlling the crowd with televised games of the gladiator type. Arnold, of course, finds himself in one of these shows and overthrows everything, with the help of his two confederates and the beautiful Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget. film, but he still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some beautiful matt paintings and sets to help him. It's desperately 80s, but I find it charming. The role is variable, Arnold does his usual grunt and scream, with a portion of doubled with a stone face. The heroine Amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotyped, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical TV man. <br /> <br /> Despite all its faults, the film shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also offers futuristic digital video montages at the time, allowing villains to change their faces in a video to fool their audience. It does not seem at all futuristic today, which is a bit alarming. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen Arnold's movies, you know when to watch this one. Enjoy.
