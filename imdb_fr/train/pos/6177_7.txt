The adaptation of SPIRIT to Will Eisner's television screen followed many other offers developed from comic book or comic pages. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium) It is indeed ironic that this is the one and only adaptation (at the date of this article) of the elegant alec, super cute, super hero of Eisner. <br /> <br /> The story goes that Republic Pictures was interested in a film version and was negotiating with the rights holder in the mid-1940s, but they were never able to conclude the agreement. The remaining part of the screen became the soap opera THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best in Republic. Maybe that was just as good, because this studio had a penchant for DIY with comics, Pulp magazines, radio and comics. <br /> <br /> As for this 1987 film designed for television, it is quite obvious that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. While an old comic reader, like me, can be a bit harsh in criticizing an adaptation, a spectator unfamiliar with the character may be able to give new observations, without any preconceived notions of what this on-screen version should look like. <br /> <br /> Well, sitting and watching the story unfold, the characters interacting in the middle of a crime wave, the Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) nailed the message with a statement. "It can not decide if it's serious or not!" That pretty much describes THE SPIRIT and its creator, Will Eisner, the true genius of comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere attempt to put the world of Eisner on the screen. The casting of Denny Colt / The Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was really very well done. Even if, in a contemporary context, it remained in the tradition of "good old days" as far as costumes are concerned, you know, when men and women still wore hats! This brings us to this last point (and the meanders), namely that the director and the production consciously made an effort and managed to give the characters an aspect of Will Eisner as far as the facial expressions and the body language. We tell them, bravo to them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that no series has followed! Oh, in today's world of movies, comic adaptations seem to be a hot topic. Maybe some experienced producers and directors could make a 1st class SPIRIT production for the big screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6/4/2008. Now, everyone who goes to the movies at the Multiplexes shopping center has seen the poster announcing the new THE SPIRIT movie (subtitled, MY CITY SCREAMS); which will be released on Christmas Day 2008. Well, then we'll see exactly what we talked about. Just keep your fingers crossed! TO BE FOLLOWED ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We saw the new film, the interpretation of THE SPIRIT by the writer-director Frank Miller there a few days. Well, we had our wish; but is it a good thing or another case of "Pay attention to what you ask, because you can get it?" Please read our article elsewhere on IMDb.com. THANK YOU!
