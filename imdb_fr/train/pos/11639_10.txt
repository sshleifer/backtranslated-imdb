I saw an advanced projection for this movie tonight. I really loved that. The film kept me on the edge of my seat all night long. Cillian Murphy is extremely scary as a villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character was a lot more scary in this movie. He played his character very well. The meanest "bad guy" I've seen in a long time. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience was laughing, panting and applauding at the same time, as if we were at the right time. The suspense is maintained throughout the film. The amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do justice to the film. The film is much better than the trailer shown. Do not wait for this film to come out in video. Go see him. Although I did not have to pay to see this movie, I would have given 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!
