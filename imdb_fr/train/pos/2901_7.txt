Tiempo de Valientes fits perfectly into the genre of the action-buddy movie, but transcends its roots thanks to an excellent cast, a formidable relationship between its actors and an exceptional photograph. Diego Peretti plays the role of Dr. Silverstein, a psychiatrist who is assigned to the inspection of detective Diaz (Luis Luque), charged with investigating the murder of two minors who appear to have participated in a plot of arms smuggling. Diaz has been suspended from his duties, but he is the ideal man for the job and must receive professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated. Silverstein and Diaz find themselves quickly mixed up in a conspiracy involving the community of Argentine intelligence and uranium. The film separates them at a crucial moment that allows Silverstein to develop his own impressive search skills. Peretti and Luque are great together and remind me of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, though Peretti does not have Hill's classic beauty. Remarkably, Tiempo de Valientes does not run out even after almost two hours. Screenwriter-director Damian Szifron creates a potential sequel in the charming coda of the film. In short, a wonderful and entertaining action comedy that does not bend to the lowest common denominator and does not insult your intelligence.
