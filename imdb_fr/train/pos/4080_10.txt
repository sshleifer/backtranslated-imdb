It's one of the best animated family movies of all time. In addition, almost all serious rivals for this title are from the same creative spirit of Hiyao Miyazaki and his studio Ghibli. Other great films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki Delivery Service". Spirited Away is good enough, but a little too scary for a typical family fare - better for teens and adults. The only thing that distinguishes "Laputa: the castle of heaven" from Miyazaki's other films is that it's more of an adventure full of tension. <br /> <br /> Why is this film so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done and the story is really engaging and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese cartoons are imaginative, but decidedly dark, cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and youthful. None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky. He has imagination to burn and the characters are well drawn, even if they are slightly exaggerated. (None of these trench coats with posers) There are many adventures, but no blood or blood. The animation is fluid, detailed and the film composition is an ally - not many flat shots. The funds are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The voice of the doubled English version is first rate, especially that of the two main performers, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is also excellent. Use the sound of your studio, if you have one. <br /> <br /> One of the things I particularly appreciated is that much of the story has remained unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know everything we need to know, and we simply have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is fully realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more completely realized than most of the minor characters, who are for the most part one-dimensional standard characters (eg, gruff general, stupid idiot, former whimsical minor, etc.). Highly recommended for 6 to 60 years!
