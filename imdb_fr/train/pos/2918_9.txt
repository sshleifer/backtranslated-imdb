... I saw him on a cable in the late 1980s, because I was a big wrestling fan since 1986. I saw him on VHS in a bin "for sale" and I bought it . <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started to train as a wrestler after the Air Force and I always came back to look at it to see how it was a very accurate representation of the people involved in the struggle (families and friends who do not understand us, travel, grief, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch, no one else can understand how creative he is. A great way to get rid of the character of Fonz he played at Happy Days at the time. See also the actors ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and the wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have the opportunity, watch it.
