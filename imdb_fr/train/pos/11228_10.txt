It's short and precise. The story writing used in Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Actor play is omnipresent, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has existed for almost 7 years and will end in mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not go back to what has already been said about the sets and graphics. Considering this is a completely volunteer team, without profit, it's pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> If this production was classified as professional production, I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible scenery. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give it an excellent rating because with the exception of a few other efforts, it's a special case. For the volume, I do not think it has been matched. Congratulations to the actors and the team for this effort that many admire.
