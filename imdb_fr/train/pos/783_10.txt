The first word that comes to mind after watching this movie is "beauty". Beauty is omnipresent, in the actor's piece (Andie is superb as always), in well-designed clichés and in the red line idea of ​​the authors - The Love. <br /> <br /> I think Kenny's character is the only white place in the otherwise boring and predictable life of these three women. His interaction makes Andie's character as entertaining as possible. When he left, it became clear that we can not really appreciate and stick to our inner beliefs and our sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie is recovering from this loss is not bad, it shows instead that life prevails in all forms, even in this small British village, which is perfectly presented. <br /> <br /> Another reason why I love this movie is that it's so British in every way - everything that's home to "fags" and accents :))). Andie is still doing a superb job! It's a shame that this movie got so bad grades. 10 out of ten!
