This is the second time I have been successful for A Perfect Spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and loved it. I still love it It is natural that this is compared to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, the other great series of Le Carre. Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" of spies; Perfect Spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person is a spy. These films share a number of themes, as well as other themes of the same genre. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity - moral, sexual, interpersonal - creates a multidimensional space true / false, inside or outside, love vs. responsibility. In a sense, these characters are the happiest when they are treated with the most grief by those they love and respect - "stabbed" in its different shades. <br /> <br /> The theme of fathers and father figures is also important. . One of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick, perhaps the ersatz father of Magnus. Throughout history, he betrays and is betrayed. A thief who always manages to climb the ladder when he is upset, who seems insensitive to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet: "Do you like your old man?" and never, "do you love me?" Maybe this is said elsewhere, but A perfect spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another theme is that of malignancy. The nature of the business is to turn others - to turn them against their government, against their friends and associates, against their values ​​and beliefs. In each of Le Carré's films I saw, The Spy who was coming out of the Cold War, The War on the Glass, The Spy Soldier Tinker Tailor, The Smiley People and A Perfect Spy, turn and be returned is the foundation of tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is not so much a theme as an artistic touch: in each of these films, there is usually only one shot, or be two shots recalling the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always just below the surface. We see their results not as streams of blood or prison cells naked, but in the objects to which the characters of Le Carre clung, inevitably sucked into the marsh. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movies above, and you like A Perfect Spy, you're in for a treat. I would also recommend the Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV), whose second and third seasons are starting to reach the level of this type of complexity. The file and burial IPCRESS in Berlin are pleasant, although light. For political intrigue, try A Very British Blow, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only a Briton decided to create The Three Kingdoms, there would be a film with intrigue and complexity.
