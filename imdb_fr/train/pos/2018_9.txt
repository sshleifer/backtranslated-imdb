I liked it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Arthur) is amazing and exciting. <br /> <br /> He could have used a little more time on the screen for the delicious Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham was incredibly "on the spot" right from the start of the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Graves in the role of Arthur Huntingdon was the one who moved me the most during my surprise. I love it in Forsyte Saga and all the other things in which I saw it. But he surpasses himself here as Arthur. In my wildest dreams, I could not have imagined playing a psycho madman like Arthur Huntingdon. But he does. And I like it. And I love her.
