After reading Diamond's book, the series disappointed me a bit, but overall it's quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the "warriors of culture" are working hard, seeing "attacks" against "Western civilization" under every carpet. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit pretentious? Sure. Like many academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing of all time. He uses the phrase "firearms, germs and steel" on all possible occasions during the series. We get it after about 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit simplistic (in the series)? Sure. The South American Spanish section is particularly entertaining, summing up a very long and complicated history to "smallpox, swords and horses", closing the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things have actually contributed (though not fully defined) to the reasons for the Spanish's success against established cultures. <br /> <br /> Does he preach * against * Western civilization? Nope. Not a word. Not in my ear. All he says is that luck played a big role in determining which crops grew the fastest, but not that luck is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that validates your sense of superiority, this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that influence the success or failure of corporations, this series offers a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
