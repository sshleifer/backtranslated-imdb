This is the kind of image that John Lassiter would do today, if there had been no progress in CGI. And it's just to say that it would be forgotten too, if technology had not made things sexy and intimate since 1983. in a Pixar movie, executed only under the restrictions of the medium c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combined with an excellent script and excellent vocal synthesis make it possible to produce an attractive film on many levels. You have to talk about it in the same breath with Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
