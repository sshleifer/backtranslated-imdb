It's a cute and sad little story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who has run to California to escape a relationship that has failed in Japan. Ken is a Japanese-American worker who aspires to rock and roll fame, but does not have a lot of concrete to offer to a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" Ken so that she can stay permanently in the United States, on the understanding that even if they live together until she gets a "green card", the marriage will be nominative only. It soon appears that the parties are not on the same wavelength - nor perhaps in the same "time zone", hence the title of the film. As a lawyer specialized in immigration law, I saw such "arrangements" take on a life of their own, so I was delighted to see how well the filmmaker had exploited the dramatic possibilities of this situation. .
