I really can not say more about the plot of the film that has not been told yet. I have not seen the movie for about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me. I searched everywhere. I have already done research on the net, but I remained empty. Last night, I was still thinking about the movie and I was trying to remember who was in the movie, but I was only 10 or 12 years old the last time I saw it and I was not even sure of to have the right movie name, so I decided to do it. another search and I finally found this show. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com, I would really appreciate it. And for all those who have not seen this film and are lucky, it is worth it.
