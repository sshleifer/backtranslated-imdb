???? A sequence of Turkish Bath in a film noir in New York in the 50s, it must be a clue! Something that curiously, in all the previous comments, no one has pointed out, but seems to me essential to the understanding of this film <br /> <br /> The sequence of Turkish Baths: an alley at night, the entrance a ladley sauna, and Scalise wrapped in a sheet, massage her thighs. Steve, the masseur is a young boxer (Beefcake!), And another guy, a bodyguard? finish dressing up. Dixon obviously hates what he sees there and becomes brutal immediately. We know he has a reputation for brutalizing suspects. Good cop, but out of easy control. Why does he hate them so much? <br /> <br /> Could it be that he hates himself. Did this part of himself inherit from his father? That dark side that could carry him to the end of the sidewalk, in the gutter? And if this dark side was hiding in a "closet"? Remember: Whenever Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the guy is lying on a bed and he has only men around him for company (the irony of the "Girls" poster stuck to the wall near from his bed!). <Br /> <br /> Scalise acts in a funny way: affected manners, turning the neck arrogantly, provocatively, pushing his inhaler (poppers?) Into his nostrils every time he speaks to Dixon. Dixon, with vengeance, is determined to pin Scalise who seems not to understand: "I have never seen a man as hateful as you, I find it almost funny to see how you followed me alone." Four years jump in my eyes as if I were someone special! Why? "<br /> <br /> Because Scalise is really a special person: he is the direct heir of Dixon's father:" Your father loved me "," Your father put me in the making of He is the criminal brother of Dixon, his dark side incarnate, and to top it off, he prefers the company of men. "Dixon knows it well:" Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? "My friends, notice that at every meeting, Dixon is mishandling Scalise: he pulls out the address book from his jacket, slaps him, hits him, scalises:" I warn you not to touch me! Dixon's homophobia is self-evident Or, to put it another way: his unspoken homosexuality Dixon, Dixon's son, is the son of a thief In response, he decided to become a cop, a good, but there is the criminal in him, a dark side: he is a violent copper, a murderer, a liar, besides, he is not married, he brings from time to time "a vertiginous blonde" to his restaurant usual, but nothing else The mocking waitress says he does not know how to make love to a woman Dixon has a deep sense of guilt and hates himself for these reasons. "A hood and a gangster like his old man. The blood will say. "Finally, in order to achieve redemption, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself: if he gets his alter ego Scalise to kill him, he will release guilt and also release the girl and her father. > <br /> The end of the film takes us back to the opening sequence: Scalise is pushed into the gutter and Dixon deserves the right to walk on the sidewalk and wins the love of the lady.He is finally straight. /> <br /> The common theme of the film could very well be that of a man who, to hide his repressed feelings, wants to experience the love of a woman (Jean Douchet) <br /> < br /> (These notes owe a lot to the commentary of Jean Douchet's film in the French DVD edited by CarlottaI
