Buddy is an entertaining family film that takes place at a time when "humanizing" animals and making them beautiful was an accepted way to interest people. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other, and that they will do everything for one another. <br /> <br /> Without being a perfect movie, the lively gorilla is pretty much realistic most of the time and the chaos that occurs at home is usually fun for the kids. <br /> <br /> This film misses the opportunity to tackle the mistake of bringing wild animals home as pets, but shows the difficulties. <br /> <A recommended film that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
