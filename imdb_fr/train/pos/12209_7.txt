I was very impressed by this small picture taken independently. The story about a pair of social fringe who meet, become friends, and obtain a support system that seemed to be lacking in childhood, is sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mainly produced by underground bands, has been widely used, as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and slow or fast movement techniques. The performances (the main actors are the writers and directors of the film) are among the best I've seen in the last two years. If you've ever felt like a square peg forced into a round slot, I really believe you'll enjoy "By Hook or By Crook".
