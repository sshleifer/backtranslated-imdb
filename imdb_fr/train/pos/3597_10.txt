(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie. I rent on movielink for a while and I decided to watch this movie. Many boxing movies seem to overflow the blood. In this film, it is seen at the level of amature. I hope maybe more attention has been paid to improving it. The film highlights the gender issues faced by some families. <br /> <br /> The end worried me a little. But the end was not a disappointment either. <br /> <br /> I think the title clearly showed her that she would win. What was unexpected was that both ended up at the end. <br /> <br /> I loved the score for some scenes. Highly recommended.
