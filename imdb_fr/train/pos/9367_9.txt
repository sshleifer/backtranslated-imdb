It's not very often that a movie can literally make the whole audience laugh, and five minutes later, tears in their eyes. Many films try to do this, but few of them can produce the emotional impact of this film. Adam Sandler practically takes you with his bursts of heat, often violent, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past does not belittle him. I will not spoil anything, but there is one scene in particular that should make you cry your eyes and your lips tremble. Even the most macho men should be heartless bastards for not feeling anything by watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another excellent performance, but Sandler surpasses him. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith perform solidly, but nothing in the lineage of the two main roles. Sandler's humor is always present, which has actually prevented this film from being depressing. There are many laughs to make, but do not think that you will stay there long, because it becomes serious without warning. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on and on to say how well this film has shot about every emotion that the human body contains, but I'm going to cut it short. I do not think it's necessary to tell you more. Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait for the DVD release, it's worth it. A moving film that will bring tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... that you are a heartless soul.
