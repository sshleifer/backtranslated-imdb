In fact, I really liked this movie. Not because of his plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it because it's one of the worst movies ever created. It's so bad, so bad, that it becomes terribly funny. Some jokes are really cool, but the rest makes me pray for the scriptwriter to be unemployed. "Men in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll on the floor laughing (the beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
