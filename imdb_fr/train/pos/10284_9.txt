"The United States of Kiss My Ass" <br /> <br /> House of Games is the first directional film by playwright David Mamet. It is an effective and sometimes surprising psychological thriller. It stars Lindsay Crouse as the successful psychiatrist Margaret Margaret, who decides to confront the player who pushed one of his patients to consider suicide. In doing so, she leaves behind the safety and comfort of her ordinary life and goes "downtown" to visit the place of low life, House of Games. <br /> <br /> The player Mike (excellently interpreted by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be a little strong and unstable. He offers a market to the character of Crouse. If she is willing to sit at his side during a match, a big game in the back room, he will cancel the debts of the patients. The card game ensues and the psychiatrist and player soon appear as a known profession (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games an interesting and essential place for any moviegoer is to guess who controls everything, be it the psychiatrist or the fraudster, or the man known to the big bluffs, David Mamet. <BR /> <br /> In House of Games, the direction is dark and mostly flat and uninteresting, but in all of David Mamet's films, the story is at the heart of the process, and not the direction. In House of Games, this shines partly thanks to the superb performances of the two main characters (showy and entertaining), but mainly as in most of Mamet's works, it is the dialogue that holds you and slowly draws you into the film. . No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlefields and word wars. Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which reminds a natural order of poker games. It is a recurring theme throughout the film and is used successfully at the right time to create vast tensions. House of Games can also be considered as a division movie "class war". With Lindsay Crouse, we have the well-educated middle-class psychiatrist, and Joe Mantegna is the opposite, the working class of America makes a living through an "honest" crime. <br /> <br /> The film seduces The viewer, like Crouse, is seduced by Mantegna and the final result is finally a very satisfying film of American cinema. And the finale of the movie is definitely something that everyone can see and watch, it's beautiful. <br /> <br /> An extremely enjoyable movie experience that deserves repeated viewing. 9/10
