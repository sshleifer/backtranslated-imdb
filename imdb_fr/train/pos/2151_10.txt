Funny. Sad. Charming. These are all words that crossed my head as I watched this beautiful and simple film. <br /> <br /> It's rare that a movie really touches me, but "Shall We Dance?" accomplished this gracefully to save. Sweet humor mixed with a subtle occasional agony easily makes this one of the best experiences of my movie watching story. It left me a feeling of discreet exultation, but with a touch of mixed sadness. <br /> <br /> And dance, oh yes, dance. Even if you are not a lover of art, or if you can not put one foot in front of another, the steps presented here will amaze you and make you want to sign up for classes as quickly as possible. It was absolutely enchanting, even the scenes that show Sugiyama's stilt steps (touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho) when he began to learn to dance were adorable from a humorous and childish point of view. And yet, this film was not only about dance, but more about the subtleties of behavior and human feelings. We see a shy man learn to express his feelings repressed by dance, a beautiful dance teacher rediscovering his love for art and the personal growth of each member of the superb support troop. <br /> Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and small agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional force and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
