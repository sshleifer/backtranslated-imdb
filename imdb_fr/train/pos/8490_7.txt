I recently saw this film in my international business class. I was not expecting anything else than another boring documentary (not to say that I do not like documentary, I just had bad luck with movies of this class). Imagine my surprise when this movie, which is actually a movie, is out. <br /> <br /> This film describes all the cultural differences in the workplace and explains how they should cooperate to achieve their ends. The clash of cultures shows how different the world is and how much we perceive ourselves until someone calls us and wakes us up. I highly recommend this film to all professionals or anyone who wants to laugh, because yes, it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's about it! Cheers
