I really did not expect much from this movie, but it was not bad; in fact it was pretty good. This movie contains some of the funniest writings I have ever seen from a movie. Now, I'm not saying it's one of the funniest movies of all time, but I laughed hard enough at times. "The police decided that my father's death was a suicide, they said he had fallen into an elevator shaft. Now this movie is not for everyone, its mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So, if you hate these movies, I would probably recommend you stay away. All in all, it was a nice movie about a group of superhero winners, who end up becoming real heroes. This is a largely overestimated comedy that many people probably have not seen, because, like me, before watching it, I expected it to be hogwash. After watching this film, I finally understand why this film was able to gather such a cast of superstars including Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even this kid from Good Burger. This is because Mystery Man is full of excellent comic writing periods 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.
