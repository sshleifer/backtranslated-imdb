Rawhide was a wonderful western TV series. Focusing on a bunch of hikers led by the trail boss, Gil Favor. Most of the episodes, especially those of the first three seasons, were actually character studies of Favor and his men. Invited stars came and went, but unlike Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes in which they appeared. Rawhide was a true flourish western and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character to never forget. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show becomes a huge success. Of course, he was ably supported by a group of great actors: Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors have left their mark in a piece of the history of television. Rawhide captured the taste of that Western era that no other series has ever managed to do for me. Later seasons have tended to split tracks and give them individual stories. For me, sometimes it did not work - the cattle collection and the regulars provided the best stories. However, there were still classic stories and Rawhide remained the business of the big shooters. Black-and-white photography added to a dark, realistic impression that other Western series rarely managed to capture. Rustlers, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful young ladies in distress, serial killers, they all showed up to give trouble to our heroes. The end of the series went off without a hitch when the last season was interrupted to less than half. The reason - Eric Fleming was gone and Rawhide was now a bodiless head - the cruel realism was gone, Gil Favor imposed respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and that made him all the more interesting. We will never see him again. Watch an episode whenever you can, they rarely disappoint.
