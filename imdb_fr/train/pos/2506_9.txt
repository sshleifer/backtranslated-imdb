Moon Child was one of the most symbolic films I saw. What I really liked was the illustration of immorality / mortality, obstacles and lifelong guidance. The film depicts much of the Kei vampire having the power of immorality and its benefits. Whether it's supernatural abilities or eternal life, that's what humans usually want. Moon Child shows the pain and inconvenience of being immortal, as feelings of loss affect almost all characters, especially the main characters, Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title "Moon Child" reveals that the film is nearing the end and that it clearly shows that everyone is a moon that shines in the manner of others and guides. I personality quite like the morality on which the film portrays. The weaknesses of the film reside in some parts of the acting and special effects, because they have made the film less authentic. The scene where the Toshi character dies could have been more powerful and more realistic if more authentic emotions had been staged. Some scenes with special effects such as gunshots could also have been more authentic without it being too much like an action video game. The sparks produced by the weapons seem too false and I think that could have been eliminated or corrected. Nevertheless, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider watching. The symbolic ideas and images that the film highlights would be easily accepted by everyone and could be of interest to many viewers. It's a pretty thoughtful and fun movie to watch.
