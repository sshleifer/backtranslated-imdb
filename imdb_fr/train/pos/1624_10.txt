The Old Mill Pond is more a tribute to African-American artists of the 30s than a denigration of the whole race (despite the caricature of Stepin Fetchit). In addition to the people I just mentioned, there are also frog or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This drawing of Happy Harmonies by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around. They all look so much like the real thing that half of me thinks I can be. Otherwise, they are certainly very flattering imitations. Even the lazy, non-fetish characterization of Fetchit is an exciting exercise here when he is pursued by a tiger while "Hold That Tiger" plays on the score. Highly recommended for animation and jazz fans of the 30s.
