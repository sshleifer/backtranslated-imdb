The Five Deadly Venoms is an awesome action movie about kung fu, shrouded in a polar mystery. There are all the usual signs of a kung-fu movie: great choreography, dreadful dubbing, different "styles" of combat and a wide range of human emotions that are greatly exaggerated and often deadly. However, the plot is certainly better than average. It's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes. From time to time, he is even able to train the audience, as when the character X receives a horrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about Five Deadly Venoms is the beauty of its themes and its morality. Just about everyone has what's happening to them. Cowards, greedy and corrupt lose the game. The wicked, consumed by selfish greed, are finally destroyed by their own treachery and stabbing. The good ones use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome obstacles and stand out. <br /> <br /> Poison Clan Rocks!
