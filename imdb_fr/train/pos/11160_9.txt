It's really the biggest Swedish movie of all time. Not only is he revolutionary in his narration, but he is also one of the first films to present the next generation of Swedish comedy and humor. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of Sweden's most intelligent and witty filmmakers, and the film really puts it forward. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna människor" (Adult people) is a warm and hilarious story about adulthood, and the question of whether we would not be better without it.
