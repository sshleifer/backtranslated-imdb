This is an excellent film about a traditional working family in the north of England. Filmed locally in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father of the dominant force in his home. Or it seems. Intelligently, the movie, based on the play, describes the complexities of family life. The distribution is also fantastic, with many familiar faces providing support.
