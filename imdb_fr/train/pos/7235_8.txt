"A Girl's Folly" is a kind of semi-comic and half-fiction documentary about the cinematic activity of the mid-1910s. We have a glimpse of life in an old movie studio, where we witness the assembly of a stage, a scene, the manipulation of movie buffs in adoration, and even a lunch at the police station. We are also aware of little-known cinematic facts - for example, did you know that "film actors" often ignore the plot of the image in which they work "? <br /> <br /> The plot of This film is essentially the discovery by the movie star, Kenneth Driscoll, a juvenile romance he discovers when he turns in a place in the countryside. I think the 30-minute version I watched was abbreviated and was on the same tape as Cecil B. De Mille's "The Cheat." It's a very credible movie - an easy watch with a large cast of extras. As a bonus, it includes some of the best-illustrated legends I've ever seen accompanying a silent movie.
