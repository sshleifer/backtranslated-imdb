Dude, if someone is waiting for a good movie of zombies after reading this title, then you are late and you deserve to be disappointed. As for me, I was expecting a low budget cheeseball zombie movie - and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly what they should be, because all the zombies had just been transformed, so they are freshly dead zombies. Obviously, they did it because it would have cost them enough to make a full FX for the zombies. I understood everything, I did not know how anyone could seriously twirl this movie. This is called "the bomb of the undead" for the sake of God! Would you like to watch "Redneck Zombies" and ANY movie Uwe Boll and WAIT for it to be excellent? Of course not! So why some imbeciles on IMDb moan like high school girls about this movie, I will never understand. Oh and YES, there are worse movies, so stop saying it's the worst movie you've ever seen, because you know you're full! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House Of The Dead" ???? Those who are among the worst I have ever seen. If you can not see it's just a low-budget zombie movie, obviously made by zombie movie fans, there's something wrong with you. I just had fun with that. Bravo of me and I would also like to see a sequel.
