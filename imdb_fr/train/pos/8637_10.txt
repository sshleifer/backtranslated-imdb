"Kalifornia" is an excellent film that makes us watch. The film has an excellent cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Runs Through, and Legends Of The Fall) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek : The New Generation, Homicide: Life on the Street and Escape From LA)) as Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis) as Adele Corners, Early's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a liberal writer who is preparing to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie, decide to move to California. So, Brian is spending an ad in college for those who want to go to California, to share their travel expenses. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is a former con and sociopath on parole who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town, is indebted, owes money to his owner. Early's parole officer stops to visit him and talks to him about a job. Lege and sees the ad, he later tells Adele, his girlfriend, to leave to go to California.Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town. Brian and Carrie do not know he's a killer who just killed her. For a while, Brian and Carrie thought of different Early and Adele, but got to know them and become friends. Carrie and Adele have become good friends. <br /> <br /> Their trip is very informative. Although Brain and Carrie do not know sooner are assassins later in the film. The question that Brian poses in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question.Early Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the mistake of his way, goes down later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good movie, I give it 10/10 stars and a thumbs up.I love the songs from the movie, especially at the end of the movie, the song "Look Up To The Sky "from The Indians.
