I saw this Belgian gem two days after seeing 'American Teen'. Do not be deceived, adolescence is a roller coaster, American or European. 'Birth of the Octopus' (or as it is called in the United States, 'Water Lillies') is the story of a 15-year-old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes looks like a young Scarlett Johansson), plays the cool girl who wants to be part of the school's swimming team, just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more than attracted to Floriane. Anne, a friend rather fleshy and unattractive, wants a boyfriend like all girls his age. Along the way, we are shown the usual range of teenage hobbies (broken hearts, in-store shopping, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). It's a quiet little movie that takes time to make its way into your system (fans of Michael Bay, take note: the pace here is slow, so be clear), but if you do not have a problem with that, Water Lillies is a charmer. No note here, but would draw a "R" hard, because of language, nudity, the situation of adults.
