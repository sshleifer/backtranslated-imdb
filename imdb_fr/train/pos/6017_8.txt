There is no way to confront Zabriskie Point from a rational point of view or to try to describe it using words and conventions that you would use for other movies. It's because it's not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling of the filmmakers who have been transformed into an object as banal as a film. What we see is not the unfolding of a plot, but rather a sequence of events that we do not see every day in the movies but that we imagine to happen as the background we will provide ourselves when we hear about friends. We see that our imagination is that of people who are abstractions for us - no one we know, but we have probably heard about it in a book, on television or elsewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people arguing, driving and, inevitably, escaping. Only flight is intangible - it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist through laziness or ... human nature. Located in Los Angeles in the late 1960s, our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern life. These creatures are actually blank slates that can display any feature we can imagine if we wish. Although the actions taken may be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not themselves criminals. They are human beings who seek to find a familiar existence, not manufactured, which exceeds the normal. Not that they are always happy or sad, but they realize a kind of self-realization when they move away from the suicide of modern life and move away from it. They only realize real life in the natural world, even if it is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, "Zabriski Point" is a praise of the attachment of the human sciences to the natural world. While even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our conception of progress, we lose our soul on the path of the death of the human spirit.
