It was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as shown elsewhere in IMDb), but he was an excellent matchmaker. It brought together two very nice people performed by two of the best actors. The lead actors (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on the screen and made it an exceptional visual experience. The fact that he drove a car to move seems to contradict all these images and posters showing that he is riding a bicycle. And did he wear socks in a scene ... apparently, the teacher never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb boots section.) Apart from historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies, it was an excellent movie to watch with excellent distribution. I give him an 8!
