This Oliver production is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly brilliant Invisible Character, who pierces this darkness as he guides an innocent boy through the most serious dangers in the hands of his own parent. Yes, although Oliver passes through the valley of the shadow of death, he fears no harm. A cane and staff are there to comfort him. In the end, he is saved from the dregs of humanity. Downstairs is Fagin, the meanest of the lot. Fagin plans not to repent once but twice, but refuses because he does not want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because he raises small pickpockets that become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence was not tarnished, but was not tried. The best is Nancy. Lacking judgment, she ignores the violent nature of Bill Sikes for lack of love. Yet, unlike Fagin, at the likely cost of her own life, she repents of her sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not what they seem to be. In my opinion, it is this quality that makes the value of art: unpredictability. I would give a "10" to this film, but its soundtrack and mood for 70s television were entertaining. Overall, a beautiful parable and a story perfectly appropriate for all audiences.
