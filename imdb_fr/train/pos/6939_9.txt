I was very impressed by this movie. I should rate it as one of the best westerns of the classical era. I say this for all: actor, mature dialogues, history of common sense and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who directed several well-photographed black films at the time, also made westerns like this one. It has the same film-black look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend Of The River". <br /> <br /> In short, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam" (Stewart) who owns this movie. the prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won in a competition. It is then stolen and passed from bad to bad. All these villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Aiding Stewart interprets this interesting story: Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Mitchell Millard, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All are fun to watch. It was a little exaggerated, however, to see Rock Hudson play an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can not have it all.
