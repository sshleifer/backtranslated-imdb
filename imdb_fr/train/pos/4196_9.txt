This crime thriller is a bit like a movie noir, but changes the postwar context in the Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In "Pickup on South Street", the police are good guys, the criminals are real guys and the only enemies are "The Commies", who finally stand out from the guys in that they are emotionally customizable, motivated by a real concern for their own value, as shown by the constant close-ups followed that stain the film. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around the characters. The personalities of this film are rather unique and detailed: avoid the pick-pocket that is able to look down any danger, and sometimes passing through his personal possessions; Moe the informant who is just trying to save for a spectacular funeral, but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of almost all other characters (and the public); Candy, the misnamed innocent girl who only thinks she works for the government and does not fully understand the plot in which she is involved; and Joey, the bad villain Commie ex-boyfriend who tries to hide everything from everyone and, ironically, is the worst person to do it. Pick up a bunch of very colorful side characters (like the guy with the chopsticks and the police) and Pickup on South Street will treat you to a splendid array of personalities as they chase through the mysterious microfilm frames stolen accidentally. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
