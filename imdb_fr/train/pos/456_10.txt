It's a charming film that brings the spirit back to life. From the use of the villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the 1920s novel to inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! The quiet joy of this film does not hold after repeated viewing. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these roles! I would love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in widescreen format.
