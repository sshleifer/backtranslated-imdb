But Johnny has continued to paint, and just has a day job for rent. He takes the day as he comes and leaves tomorrow to his destiny. There is an instant gross attraction between Zandalee and Johnny and they enter an affair. But Zandalee struggles with her desire to be desired, her conscience and her love for her husband. But none of them, neither Zandalee, nor Johnny, nor Thierry can prevent the relations between them from becoming totally uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's a thriller. But maybe more of a thriller than a normal thriller about life, death and the threat of violence. Not that a thriller of heart can not take fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different angle. And it's really only in the second part of Zandalee that the thriller is released, and even if the basics are established in the first period, I can not really describe the genre as a thriller. Much more than a romantic drama than anything else, but with the underlying currents of other genres. The developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a little hint of sensual erotic nature. Because that's what it's about, what motivates the characters and therefore the whole story. Desire. The need to have and the need to be. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's pretty good, certainly much better than its current rating (4.1) anyway. It takes its time, but it creates a good feeling of suspense and manages very well the erotic part, with taste. It's always an integral part of the story, you have to be there to give the story the weight it needs, and I never thought it was an excuse to show a naked breast or whatever it's kind of. Unfortunately, the culmination of the story comes well before the end, and the end itself is rather flat, even if in its own way it is dramatic. <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive, led by famous actors like Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and very skilled at interpreting feelings of desire sometimes subtle, she excels both Cage and Reinhold sometimes goes a bot to the sea and becomes a little rough. Her career is too thin for the talent she shows Zandalee. I just hope it's because of his own choices. Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano are two favorites. <br /> <br /> When you're in a good mood, it's a great movie that could help you. have used another end to get the credit they really deserve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
