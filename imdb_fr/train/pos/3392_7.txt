It was a very thought-provoking film, especially for 1973. At the time, it was a huge box office success. After the 1970s, he seemed to be forgotten, but his central messages were too important to disappear completely. In fact, he was at least fifteen years ahead of his time (no one had ever heard of the "greenhouse effect" before 1985). The controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely discussed. <br /> <br /> The sets and special effects may seem a little out of date, but the big winnings for science fiction movies were a bet from that era. If you look closely you will see that everything is usually logical. This is a message movie, not for star wars zonked out fans who can not sit for a minute of thought stimulation unless it exceeds a million dollars of explosions. <br /> <br /> It was also Hestons' last good film, the end of his famous dystopian science fiction trilogy. After that, catastrophic epics and big budgets will please the crowd. It may not be the most entertaining two-hour movie of all time, and the end may be terrifying and depressing, but it's hard to find a courageous filmmaker to tackle a subject like this.
