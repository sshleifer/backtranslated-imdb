Who said horror was not an educational genre, huh? Thanks to this wonderful Hammer short film, at least I can NEVER give a foreign visitor a wine and a slice of salt bread at home, because he might be a hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts and spirit forever! Thank you Marteau! The tenth episode of the House of Horror series is another one that I can not wait to see, mainly because the type of president of the director was Don Sharp; one of the best British filmmakers, but still underestimated. Sharp was at the origin of some very good Hammer films, such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", as well as neglected independent productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". His contribution to House of Horror is unquestionably one of the best in the series, with a complex but fascinating plot that revolves around delicious occult themes. The plot is centered on two antique dealers who fall on a strange object that looks like a mirror, but it is actually an old surveillance device that can be used to summon Choronzhon; the demonic guardian of the abyss. The satanic cult is very fond of the mirror because they need it for their ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the true value of the device. When he takes a clearly petrified girl who flees the sect not to be sacrificed, Michael is further immersed in an occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typically British horror topics, but David Fischer's script is never boring and offers many twists, among which a very inventive paroxysm. There is also a lot of tension to admire, the dialogues are witty and the performances of actors are splendid (especially John Carson, the leader of the cult, is truly strange). Recommended!
