The simple portable camera gives an almost documentary feeling to this film and also concerns dogma films. <br /> <br /> Do not you ever get bored of those cop movies at the Hollywood style with beefy guys who get james bond assignments would be envious of? Fed up with the married unmarried cop, the divorced man but the family, the donut personified and the tough hunter? Have you ever wondered what the real work of the police was like? <br /> <br /> Well, for Germany, this movie shows it to you. Located in the north between West Germany and East Germany, the former DDR, a laid-off postal worker starts her job, just out of the police academy. She quickly finds her way to the usual customers and gets used to being a policewoman ... but it's not very fun. <br /> <br /> Other German crime films like Derrick, Der Alte and others have worthy officers talking calmly with the suspects. These cops have to face the lowest of the social ladder. A good dialogue and realism make this view an interesting sight, especially if you know a little bit about this part of Germany.
