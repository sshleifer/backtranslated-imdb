He-he-hello !! It's a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your own independent and fun New York chick from the early '90s. With her party friends, she meets a mature Turkish salesman. This is a new age story for these new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a sloth become a mature woman. Hope is given to all lazy people who may have the impression that their only skills are able to maintain themselves while being hammered and who have quite the courage to make good evenings. <br /> <br /> One word, Parker Posey makes this movie fantastic. I have never been a big fan of her, but this film makes me want to watch all her movies. There are subtle maneuvers that have perfected his character. If you want to laugh and have a good time, be sure to watch this movie. Repeated views are a must.
