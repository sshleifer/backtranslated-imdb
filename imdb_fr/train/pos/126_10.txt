Zentropa is the most original film I've seen in years. If you love the unique thrillers influenced by the film noir, this is the perfect remedy against all Hollywood blockbusters that clutter the rooms these days. Von Trier's follow-ups, such as Breaking the Waves, are gaining more and more acclaim, but it's really his best work. It is flashy without being embarrassing and offers the perfect combination of suspense and black humor. It's a pity he decided that portable cameras were the wave of the future. It is hard to say who dissuaded him from the style he is exposing here, but it is the loss of everyone that he has turned rather to his very theoretical dogma.
