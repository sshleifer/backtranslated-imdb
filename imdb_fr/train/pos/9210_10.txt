I think it's one of the best movies I've seen. I am a man of a certain age and I like most westerns. I like movies based at least partly on facts. If I'm not mistaken, it's such a movie. I also like revenge movies, which I think is also qualified. Some of my favorite parts of the film were the opening scene with the flogging scene and the shooting of the barn. I felt that the corral beat scene was a little exaggerated but did not affect how I felt about the full movie. I saw what I think is the continuation of this movie in an episode of gun smoke. I also enjoyed that. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie, I will watch it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this movie were well played. I thought Randy Travis did not play the role of a villain, but I still enjoy his acting.
