Watching the movie, I never felt it was meant for the idiot box. I always thought it was a great hit movie of the late 90. But after seeing the Internet as it was for television, I was shocked because for a television film, c is absolutely fantastic! <br /> <br /> What worried me the most is the length. I felt that the face-to-face fight scene should have been removed because it was completely useless. In addition, he started hanging out late because it seemed like the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with great performances from everyone. I just thought Patrik Frayze looked a little haggard. I also had the impression that Gogool, who looked disgusted, was getting a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted by the beautiful African landscapes. In addition, the first half of the film would have given me this film a 9. Yet, it is an excellent film for television. 8 out of 10
