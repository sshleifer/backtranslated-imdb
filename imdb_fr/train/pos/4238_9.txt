In appearance, it is a post-war romantic comedy above the average. Under the veneer, it's the character actor MGM that makes the funniest game. <br /> <br /> The main roles are clear, but all the secondary characters are very counter-typed. Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (Obsessive-Compulsive Professional Fussbudget) and Sig Ruman (The Marx Brothers' Sworn Enemy in _Night In Casablanca_ and the Always Wonderful _Night At The Opera_) Play An Intentional Group Tent to bring the two roles together instead of separating them as their usual characters would. <br /> <br /> He also makes fun of many conventions about romantic comedy, which is another indication that this might not be a really "straight" romantic comedy, because it's an ironic many romantic comedies of the post-war period and their characters in two dimensions and series. <br /> <br /> I only saw it Once, with interruptions, so I can not be positive, but this film is perhaps one of those that worked better when it was shot , but it is less successful now that viewers "see" these secondary characters a completely different goal. I guess that's the case when I give it 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
