Not for people without a quick wit or a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you have none, you can not understand it. And if you do not understand, you will not be able to enjoy it. :) For example, if you think that Picasso is the name of a car produced by CitroÃ«n, if you see a painting by Picasso, you will pass by him, deciding that it is a basket of a street painter. :) So do not judge, before trying to understand :) In the end, I think it's a must for anyone with an open mind. Rest my N1 remains the purchase of Shawshank! And remember that all things can not be put in frames. Because there are things in this world, any framework is not suitable.
