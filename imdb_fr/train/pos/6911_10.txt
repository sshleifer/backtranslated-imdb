While "The kiss of the spider-woman" referred to Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, he works this time for a dictator in a fictional Latin American country. More precisely, the dictator suddenly died, so Julia replaces the presidente by a Broadway actor (Richard Dreyfuss) who is making a film in the country. From there, Dreyfuss must find out how to become a dictator while reconciling his own life. <br /> <br /> Is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in Latin America into comedy? "Moon Over Parador" does a good job with that. No matter what they do in this movie, they succeed. This simply proves why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our time and what we lost on the death of Raul Julia. Well worth a visit. Also with Sonia Braga (co-starring with Raul Julia in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is hot.
