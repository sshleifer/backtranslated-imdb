Nowadays, most people do not watch classic movies like this one. Most friends only watch movies from the 90s to the present day. It's a bit stingy. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this one are unique masterpieces. Only because, at the time these films were thought and realized, it was when the ideas were fresh. Now people are trying to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. For real fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator investigating the disappearance of a movie actor and stumbles over three other strange events with former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything anymore, because I will ruin the movie more than I already have. But it's a fantastic movie for as old as it is. And I would not mind looking at it again!
