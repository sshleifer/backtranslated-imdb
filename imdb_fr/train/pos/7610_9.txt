Only seen season 1 so far but it's just great !! A wide variety of people stuck on an island. Nobody seems to be what they seem to be and everyone seems to have tons of skeletons in their closets ... it looks like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is it so great? It's probably not, but then, a spoon full of X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and a big "hey" and an island that represents everything you've always dreamed about - in your most scary nightmares and where you'll be lost. The story has had so many twists and turns that it's amazing. Very well organized, solid as an actor with a liberating acceptance of the fact that everyone is human (well, almost everyone ... I think ...) with its good and bad sides. But weird oh so weird ...
