It is in this room that the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays the role of an author of the Agatha-Christie type who locks her nephew by marriage in a safe. Gordon thinks he has murdered his niece and the young man dies of suffocation while on his way to New York. He managed, however, to leave behind some clues, scratches on some black safes and a note improvised and well hidden. Columbo enters the case, suspects her immediately and resolves the mystery by simply using her supernatural and supernatural intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is there as Gordon's secretary and so-called lead singer. Hartley is, I believe, the granddaughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure if his ancestors had anything to do with his pretty navel exposed in a belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner. <br /> <br /> The murder is well managed. It's a good plot, and none of the performers or the team does anything. But the most remarkable figure here is Ruth Gordon, who is only a few feet tall. She was over 80 and looked. There are times when she almost staggers, but she still exudes charm. His game is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when she is serious or when she puts Columbo and the audience. She gave good lines too. What a humor there is in Gordon. Columbo has none of his frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a great job for everyone involved.
