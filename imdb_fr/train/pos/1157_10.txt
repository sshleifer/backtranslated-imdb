It's one of the best comedies of all time! The writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, well, just look at the names of the actors and you'll understand why she's so great. If you are a fan of Kevin Kline, he performs (as always) a fantastic performance and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
