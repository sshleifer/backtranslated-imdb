Over the series, "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is one of the best action series of the 1930s. Directed at a time when studios could still produce a large distribution, it runs throughout its 12 chapters . <br /> <br /> In 1824, the president of the new Mexico City, Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) tries to place his new country on a sound financial basis. To this end, it has arranged for rich gold mines to be transported to the capital by the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the city council plot to steal the expeditions in the name of Don-del-Oro to a god in golden armor who, with the help of the local Yaqui tribe, hopes to settle sovereign of Mexico. Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery) faces him. He forms a legion of inhabitants to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is assassinated by the men of Don-del-Oro, a stranger, the fopish Don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in town. Diego aka Zorro seizes the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The symbolic heroine of the play is Ramon's sister, Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Diego and Ramon both sit on the local council, the Counsil. It soon becomes clear that some of the other members of the Council are linked to Don-del-Oro. First there is the president of the council (Leander of Cordova), the chief of the militia Manuel (John Merton), the chief judge Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> The sequel presents several thorny escapes of Zorro and his confederates from the Don-del-Oro disciples. We have the rope bridge still crumbling, the deep chasm between two cliffs on which only Zorro can jump, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires and trainers and wagons crashing or passing above the cliff. Hats off to the beautiful Republic stunt team led by legendary Yakima Canutt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his cascade of jumps on a team of runaway horses, then falls under the coach he has repeated in other films, including John Ford's "Stagecoach" the same year. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, Zorro finally unmasks the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace in the valley before sunset in chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King are among the actors, and if you take a closer look, you may notice fragments of future soap opera star Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and stuntman Canutt. The "Great" Jim Pierce will probably be remembered for playing Tarzan in 1927 "Tarzan and the Golden Liom" (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Burroughs, daughter of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Completely pleasant.
