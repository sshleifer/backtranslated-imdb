Standard rise of the tale of glory which has some strong points. Number one, Lonette McKee as a sister who gives a great performance as a star. The fact that it never became a great sensation after that goes beyond me. Unfortunately, it is a support character and we are forced to focus on Irena Carter's silly character, Sparkle, whose fame is easy, boring and unconvincing. However, every time the girls come on stage and occur, the film comes back to life. The original music of Curis Mayfield must be rented. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The image quality was quite low, as well as the production values ​​that I guess. Overall, it's worth a look.
