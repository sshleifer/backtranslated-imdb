The most important thing about this film is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor in the role of Christy Brown, artist and fighter from Guinea, who despite his physical condition overcame all obstacles. As a person who has worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance has been shocking. The tremendous support Christy received from his family, Dubliners of the low-income working class, encouraged him to do the impossible. This picture brilliantly shows that this support did not read the book, but the dialogues were wisely written to capture the arrogant and spiritual personality of Christy Brown. . I recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie buffs.
