Probably the two main meanings of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" are that the wildcat described in "A Wild Hare" now has a name and pronounces his famous "Of course, you realize it means war!" for the first time. Above all, the crowd of Termite Terrace still wanted to know what to do with this rascal with long ears. This is certainly a must for hardcore fans like this, but others will probably have no reason to be interested. <br /> <br /> But do not get me wrong, it's pretty hilarious what Bugs Bunny does to the incredible credulous Elmer Fudd. The clear shades of things to come abound throughout the drawing. I recommand it.
