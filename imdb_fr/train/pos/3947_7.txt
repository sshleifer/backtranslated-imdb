Based on a true story of how a man ahead of his time - the great American poet and humanist Walt Whitman of the 19th century - made a significant contribution to the way Western medicine treats people with psychological problems. <br /> <br /> Interested in treating people with psychological problems, he began to associate with psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing the psychological methods of the time (inhuman and cruel methods of ignorance), Walt rejected them and treated patients with compassion and dignity, encouraging others to do the same. full of drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
