Life Pod is one of those movies you just watched and you try not to analyze too hard. The acting is rather amateur, at best. The special effects are obviously small budget, but not too bad. The scenario is rather common, but with an interesting twist. Computer amok, but not exactly a computer and the current amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still, the film has its moments and is quite observable. For me, at least part of the appeal of this movie is Kristine DeBell's leading role. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but as a former playmate of the month, she's pretty cute. In all Life Pod is a bit like the other low-budget science fiction movies of the 1980s and a little predictable. <br /> <br /> The White Star Lines bit is cute, so completely inaccurate. The last of the shares of the White Star Lines Company was purchased by Cunard Lines in 1947 and the last ship to sail under the colors of the White Star was the Britannic (not Titanic's sister), scrapped in 1960.
