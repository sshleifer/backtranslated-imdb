Masayuki Suo, who directed this film, plays a role. After the decent "Fancy Dance" and the classic (in Japan, anyway) sumo-college comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo followed his own footsteps with dazzling success. <br /> <br /> The story is engaging. We both laugh (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as he is in Suo's previous two films) and we really embody the characters. But for me the big bonus is the look that this film gives to the viewer in Japanese society - the real life in Japan. Suo has the gift of showing real activities with an entertaining flair. The result is a film that will attract you, make you laugh, make you think, entertain and give you a glimpse of Japan today. <br /> <br /> Also look for the 8 main actors of Shiko Funjatta. , as they all appear again in various roles, ranging from secondary characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).
