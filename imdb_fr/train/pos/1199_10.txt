This is the most convincing and excellent performance Robert Taylor has ever given. It even surpasses his wonderful performance as "Johnny Eager", 14 years after this movie. His looks are always a marvel to see, but he now has a maturity that gives him the edge in this tough and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who does not kill for money but for fun. His fiery assassination, not only of buffaloes, but of human beings, is magnificent to watch. He is basically a lonely man, he needs the people around him, but they do not appreciate him because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is fed up with hunting and just follows him because he is a failure. On the way, Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her in vain, but finds that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is a little sad to watch, so fed up with hunting, want to go with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as a drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise crunches and his accordion playing. Russ Tamblyn plays the half-breed trying to fit into a white world. The group is a strange mixture of good and bad, young and old. In the end, Taylor is frightened by the buffalo, like many hunters before him, and leaves leaving Sandy with the girl. Upon his return that night, Sandy leaves with the woman, setting off Charlie as a deadly murderer on a quest to get Sandy and have the girl for himself. The final confrontation takes place in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's Taylor's film from the beginning and he was really a much underrated actor of the time.
