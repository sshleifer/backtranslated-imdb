I admit that I am a vampire fanatic: I saw so many vampire movies that I lost the account and this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed by John Carpenter's vampires, and when I discovered there was a sequel, I bought it directly. This film does not obey exactly the same rules as the first one and it is not so dark, but it's pretty close and I got the impression that it was based on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was nice but hard enough for the viewer to believe he might actually survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorite parts was just after meeting Zoey and wandering the bathroom of the restaurant to check if she was more than she seemed. His comments are admirably irreverent and yet extremely practical, which contrasts well with the rest of the scene. <br /> <br /> The other members of the cast were also well chosen and knitted well to produce a fun and original movie. This is not just a cover of the first film and it has grown similar to that of Fright Night II, from Fright Night. There are different elements that make it a recent movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I would recommend this one. If you prefer your films to be less bloody, choose something else.
