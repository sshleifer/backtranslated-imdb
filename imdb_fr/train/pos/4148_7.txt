Let's be clear: this film does not seek to redefine the genre, it is not Dr. Strangelove or Young Frankenstein. Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler of SNL and Parker Posey, an independent queen, are as charming as ever. The story is basic: the three girls have been "losers" at the university and are still pursuing it. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can not even have an appointment with a blind man), Posey is a senator's assistant (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in office" .. A few minutes later ... I'm a bit slow, all right!), And Dracht has a gay fiancee (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). They have to prevent the senator's "ungainly" daughter (the always cute Amber Tamblyn from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") from embarrassing her during the spring break. So of course, they have to go watch it and it results in some hilarity. In short, a light and simple comedy, quite short and very pleasant
