I think part of the reason this movie was made ... is for the players who actually play all of Nancy Drew's PC games. There have been a lot of movies recently based on video games, and I think this is one of them. <br /> <br /> This film does not follow any book. But this follows some parts of the games. I buy and play all Nancy Drew games right out of the box. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of the mouse!" And some of these games have actually won the Parents' Choice Choice Awards Gold Award. They are not only fun, but you can actually learn one or two things while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my stepchildren to see them and they loved it! The 10-year-old Old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing this game that I thought she would also like the movie. And I was right ... not only did she love this movie, but she could not wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one. <br /> <br /> My other daughter-in-law is only 7 years old and she also loves the movie but she is still a bit too young to play games, but she likes to watch her sister play sometimes just to see what that is happening. <br /> <br /> Games are based for children 10 years and older. All games usually receive pretty downhill reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on games, check out the HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So, personally, I thought the movie was pretty good and I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD.
