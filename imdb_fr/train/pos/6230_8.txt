1936 is the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film for RKO that year is the third film in this collection ?? "Follow the fleet" of Mark Sandrich. This time, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a sailor on leave who falls by chance in the waterside cafe, where Sherry Martin (Rogers) shouts to everyone. Yes, you guessed it ?? they are hot for each other again. Only this time, Sherry's little sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole beautiful novel by falling under the spell of Bake's marine friend, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a kind of use to send them and throw them away, forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion of all the sailors in general. Irving Berlin gives an immeasurable class to the debates with its classic and elegant score, including the standards "Let Yourself", "I put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's face music and dance"; the latter is a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another not-so-instantly recognizable and quite sublime step for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer on "Follow The Fleet" is a little weaker. The gray levels remain well balanced, but now they are a little thick, with a tonal variation much less important than previous titles. The grain is always present. The same is true for age-related artifacts. Once you have opted for the slightly dense and sometimes sharper image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a movie of this vintage. The sound is mono but very well balanced. The supplements include a featurette, a theatrical trailer and a short subject, but oddly enough ?? no audio commentary. Given the importance of this film in the Astaire / Rogers canon, this is a non-characteristic forgetting of Warner Home Video.
