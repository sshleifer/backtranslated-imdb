I really liked this Summerslam because of the appearance of the arena, the curtains and the general look that interested me for some reason. Anyway, it could have been one of the best Summerslam ever since the WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna; now it was time to have a fat man against a strong man, but I'm happy times have changed. It was a terrible main event, as every Luger match is terrible. Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his big monster a Diesel bodyguard, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart starts by facing Doink , then Jerry Lawler, and the stuff with the Harts and Lawler have always been very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez in another dreadful match. Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger. This match was boring and its end is terrible. However, he deserves 8/10
