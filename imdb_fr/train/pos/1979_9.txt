My girlfriend Annette and I watched this together and we will comment. <br /> <br /> We both loved watching this, even though Dicken's work took a little liberty. A lot of Dicken's work is a little dark and dismal (including Oliver Twist), but this film has changed everything. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically) and the characters were lighter. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Normally, I do not care about music and dance, but the tunes of this production were catchy and lively, and the choreography was great. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: It's a lot to say from Travis. I can not emphasize enough the quality of the dance numbers. You can say, for example, that these boys really worked hard to perfect the routine. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Three actors have really distinguished themselves at IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Dude, Oliver Reed can really make a good guy. This scene where you see his eyes through the mail slot gave me chills in the back ... awesome. And this kid Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she was killed). She can sing too! Congratulations to the casting department on their choices there. I hated the kid Oliver Twist tho. He was too whiny and too weak for my taste. (I kept wishing Bill Sikes would throw him in the mud during the chase.) And they should not have him singing either. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Playing was really superb. In addition to the three stars mentioned by Travis, I thought Ron Moody (Fagin) was doing a great job. He was so funny and at the same time slightly sinister. Supporting actors were great too. Harry Secombe played his part of Mr. Bumble very well. And he has a wonderful voice. I saw Mr. Secombe play in another film titled "Davy" where he performed an opera singer with enjoyable results. The talented Harry Secombe should have been in a lot more movies. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, history is not quite true to the book, but the IMO was stronger. This film was not boring either, unlike some musicals. And continuity has allowed you to keep moving with the characters. The melodies did not interfere with the plot or did not make you sleep too long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any musical film that Travis looks at in its entirety must be a rare find. And this one is indeed a rare find. It is a very easy-to-look production that guides the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. At a time when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces, it was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our combined score for this is 8.5 out of 10. (We will round to 9 in this case.). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I attributed this score to 7 mainly because Oliver Twist's son (Mark L.) got upset and his songs were a torture for my sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an exceptional film. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. The movies do not get any better than that. And you can say that everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one ... even if you do not normally like musicals. It's really a rare treat.
