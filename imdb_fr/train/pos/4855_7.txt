The question of whether or not we like this film version of "The Ghost Train" invariably depends on one thing and one thing only: your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey. <br /> <br /> It tends to fly almost in which scene it is, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you want him to move in or out a little, to allow the many characters in the plot to appear and grow (which they do to some extent). But one way or another, everything comes back to Askey's character Tommy Gander. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the movie and even, to a certain extent, Askey. I always seem to send it to the VCR at these weird hours of the early morning, when I can not sleep and really do not have the energy to look at something else. Watching old black-and-white films in the dim light before dawn seduces me ...
