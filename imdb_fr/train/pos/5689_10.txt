First of all, this is a review of the two discs accompanying the "Wonderland" DVD rental. <br /> <br /> The two films included in the rental, "Wonderland" and documentary Johnny Wadd completely erase the myth created by "Boogie Nights". The myth being that the characters involved in the adult film business were more than slimy slackers who would do anything for money, actually denying that they were nothing more than Ugly whores loathsome. This is surprisingly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" did to the fable "The Godfather" and to most of the rest of gangster romance. <br /> <br /> Now, what pissed me off watching these movies, and will probably irritate anyone who has seen and loved "Boogie Nights," is how well-educated and sophisticated people can be stupid and gullible. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no redeeming quality. Holocopsist, Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused his family. He was totally engrossed in his quest for personal gratification and was undoubtedly a key player in the brutal murders perpetrated on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The film exposes the great lie that "Boogie Nights" was, and reinforces, Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic activity known as the adult entertainment industry. This should be mandatory to watch, both features on the DVD "Wonderland", for anyone who had positive opinions about the story in the movie "Boogie Nights".
