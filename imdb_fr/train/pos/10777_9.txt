Radiofreccia is a film about us all, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. It's a brilliant film where a group of friends like us all live through the difficulties of growing up in a small town during one of the most significant decades of the last century. The film does not adopt a happy or sad approach, it tells us simply a story that we could all have lived. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and sorrow. The strength of this story lies in the fact that we love more and more characters, it's one of those movies that you will watch again and again, you will feel closer to the small town of Emilia-Romagna where it is place. Hoping one day to be able to walk in its streets alongside Freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crack of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International, playing their dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh, make you cry sometimes, it will shock and comfort you, it will give you and take you. Personally, I think it has played an important role in my life and that of my friends, and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours.
