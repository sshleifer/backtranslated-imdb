I really liked this movie! Even if it does not look like any of the books, it's still Nancy Drew's classic style. I saw a lot of commercials for this movie, and since I was really in Nancy Drew's books, I had very high expectations for this film and they have certainly met those expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly as I imagined them when reading the books. I'm really happy to have seen this movie. All the actors and actresses really acted as they did in the series of books. Since I saw this movie, I wanted to read every book by Nancy Drew. All the actors and actresses really got into their characters and this was clearly shown during the broadcast of this film on the big screen. It really seemed that all the actors and actresses were really in the positions where the characters were. I certainly give this film a 10 out of 10.
