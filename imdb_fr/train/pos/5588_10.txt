The first time I had the opportunity to see this classic almost forgotten, it was in the early 80s, in one of our art houses as a revival. As I watched this fever dreaming of an exercise in sexuality of the 1930s, I thought about YOWZA! They managed to get murdered in Europe during the day. Unfortunately, this film was heavily cut in its original American version by Hayes Office (the fierce government censorship council, launched by the buccaneer "holiest than you", Will Hayes ... a former Post Office official, if you The reason is that, because of its general theme of human sexuality (celestial prohibition, men actually had sex in the 1930s). The intrigue of Ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a much older man and regrets it later. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome younger man and has an affair with him, leading to the divorce of her previous husband (another no no in Hollywood movies at the time - Divorce!). Although the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the first time that the director was working in the sound format (ie the film seems to have techniques that were mainly used in silent films - Expressionism of the 1920s). It is always worth looking for a window on the first European speaking images, alongside Luis Bunuels The Golden Age (1930) and "Vampyre" by Karl Gustav Dryer (1931). Not rated, but contains this famous nude swim scene and some thinly veiled sexual references, which would cost little more than a PG-13 by today's standards (but could easily have landed the dreaded "X" in years 30, if it already existed, then)
