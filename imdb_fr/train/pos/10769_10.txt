I love Monte Carlo and I really enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I did not know Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very nice, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the rejected girl confused with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a day on the field as a bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a fool. Cybill Shepard did a very good performance as a beautiful homemaker ignored and vulnerable. Charming ensemble distribution. A lot of talent, intelligent scenario, a lot of things and beautiful places. Just a nice catch for a gloomy day. Especially in winter, when a trip to Europe is not on the horizon.
