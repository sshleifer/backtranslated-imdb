I saw this film criticized with the following statement: "If you can go beyond moralisation ...", it misses the point. Moralizing is in the viewer's consciousness, so to speak. This is a decent movie with a standard murder mystery, but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through. The resolution leaves the viewer wondering: "What would I have done in this position?" And I must believe that this is exactly what the filmmaker had planned. To this end, and until the end to entertain the audience, the film succeeds. I also like the fact that violence is never on stage, but just outside the camera. We know what has just happened. it's just not served in front of us, then rubbed against our face, as would be the case today with contemporary bandage blood and clothing. In addition, violence is not the problem. It is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, which is intelligently solved, though disturbingly.
