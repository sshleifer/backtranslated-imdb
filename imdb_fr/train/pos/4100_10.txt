Walerian Borowczyk's "The Beast" is based on the new "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimee. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished marquis, arrives at the ruined castle of the family and learns a beast mythical ursine supposed to prowl in the forest nearby. It is legendary that an old lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) had a perverse sexual relation with the creature and Lucy is consumed by the dreams of the incident. "The Beast" is a mix of art and surreal horror, explicit sleaze and porn. There is an implied bestiality, assaults and perversions in the priesthood, a copious false ejaculation on bare breasts, a masturbation with a rose and, the most graphic, most graphic eponymous beast playing with an incredibly big dick. This truly erotic film is wonderfully photographed and has no taste. The women here are of a striking beauty and are nude most of the time. In general, "The Beast" is a visual feast. Whether it's an attention-to-detail fetishism or eye-catching visuals, Borowczyk's masterpiece must be watched with care and attention. A must for fans of European cult cinema.
