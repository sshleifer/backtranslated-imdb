A comforting little movie, not just for kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (with no trace of Inspector Morse about him). The boy playing William was also doing a good job, although I did not find him convincing in all the scenes. I loved the atmosphere of the small village and the slower pace of life of the time. As far as I know, the scenes in London were historically accurate. <br /> <br /> It made me think of a Scandinavian film I saw a few years ago called Mother of Mine. This film featured a boy evacuated from Finland to Sweden during the Second World War. The wife of the family who greeted him asked for a daughter because she had lost her daughter. Having a boy instead, she ignores him completely. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish still complicates things. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has enjoyed Goodnight Mr. Tom, he has the same feeling.
