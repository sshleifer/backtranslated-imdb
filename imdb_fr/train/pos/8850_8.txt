Legendary director Sidney Lumet delivers one of his best films from his historic career in this tense and ultimately shocking story about a family whose child is dysfunctional. With an A-list cast directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney, Lumet captured not only sloppy police stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary People. <br /> <br /> Many viewers may be disconcerted and feel discouraged by the construction of the plot that Lumet has accompanied here. Instead of showing it in a linear fashion, he chose the Tarantino road and shows the central scene of a flight that went wrong from different points of view and is out of order. Personally, I found that very satisfying and I constantly guessed what would happen next. The scenario is very strong, with excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All actors are totally enthralling to watch and Lumet obviously has fun directing a style in which he does not generally dive. A lot of action and suspense to hold the audience for two hours, it's a rare movie that does not do it. Do not disappoint for a moment.
