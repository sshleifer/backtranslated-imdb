Although there were some difficult moments and some intrigues that were not perfectly faithful to the character, it was Classic H: LOTS. The characters, apart from Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true to form, and the meeting scenes of Pembleton (AndrÃ© Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as profound and well-interpreted as ever to honor the small screen . /> <br /> "Homicide: The Movie", also called "Life Everlasting", is a fan film, but it stands alone, as well as any other episode of the series, lasting 2 hours. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura have done a remarkable job of combining 7 seasons and all the major cast of the "Best TV Show" together for the series finale that NBC has never bothered to give it. True to the form "Homicide", there was no happy ending, that is life. That's what has always distinguished this series from the inconsistent cops left behind by cops on television. Congratulations to the writers and actors for creating something throughout the series and in the film that challenged viewers and producers. <br /> <br /> ** My name is myself a "homicidal maniac" reason to keep my colleagues in a spirit of cooperation. **
