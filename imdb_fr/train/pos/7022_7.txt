FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I had been waiting for this film for almost a year and I finally saw it at the premiere at SB. I met some of the actors, who were really nice and who were great in the film. I watched the trailer so many times that I did not know what to expect but I felt completely sucked. The movie was really beautiful to watch and the music was good too. I recommend it to all ryan donowho fans, and dominique swain was very talented. the other actors were good too. I hope it will be released soon on DVD !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first entered Ryan watching OC, then I saw him in a group of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. He's great in this movie, and everything he does is independent. I love Dominique too, but I did not see her so much. I hope to see them both soon !!!
