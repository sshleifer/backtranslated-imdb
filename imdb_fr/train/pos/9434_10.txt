I remember seeing this film on television a few years ago without paying much attention to it, perhaps even missing the first half. So I came to the conclusion that he was dull and overestimated. I decided to come back last night to see if I missed something the first time. I certainly did. It's one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and has clearly had a lot of influence on today's movies and will probably be forever. I can not believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds present their career performances and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with a sense of disgust and fear long after watching it, it's really horrible. Oh, and did I mention that the theme song is also excellent? Well, that's right, and this movie should be seen by all movie lovers. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie. Do not expect a picnic.
