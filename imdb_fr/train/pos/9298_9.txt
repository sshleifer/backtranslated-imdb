Quite simply, one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It's a parody of crime-life, parody of everything that represents Chicago 1930.- It is not really necessary to underestimate this film because its ranking is less than 5. It is a mass opinion and hypnotized . Who decides to watch him - he will regret, who decides not to look at him - will regret more.
