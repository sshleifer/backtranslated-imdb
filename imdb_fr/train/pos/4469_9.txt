In general, the musicals of the 1940s had a pre-established formula - and if you're studying movies, you know what I'm talking about - a certain length, very "showy" performances that were great on the surface but never got into the true personality of the characters, etc. <br /> <br /> THIS IS DIFFERENT - and better light years and well worth his nomination for the best picture of the year - 1945 (although no chance to beat the final winner - Lost Weekend) . <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career - yes, I know "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This one is different. He really gets into his character of "sea bass" thinking (at the beginning) that "picking up a girl while on leave" is nothing more than a lark. And if you had to invent a "story" to convince her - so be it. A bit like the musician when he is "getting into the door". The final hilarity of the film stems mainly from the attempt of his and his new friend (Sinatra) to make the "story" good in order to "bring in the girl" from which he falls REALLY and unexpectedly. You will have to see the movie to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are so many other elements of a good movie in this one, it's a classic boyfriend story, nostalgia for the time of the Second World War. was almost over (the war ended about a month after the release of the film), an awareness that a guy who has always laughed at life can discover that he is really a great human being, great songs and probably some other elements of making classic movies that I can not think of yet. <br /> <br /> Why not a 10? Towards the end - at nearly two and a half hours begins to feel a little long. There's a little Gene Kelly ballet number that must have made a sensation in 1945, but that seems dated and seems to add minutes now. But overall, it's a winner at every level.
