I loved this film !!! The characters were people you could feel. The young man back from the service is still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in romantic head as well as Donna Reed in love with his life. The looks he gave her as if he had been hungry to see her, as well as his hesitations and confusion, as well as his feelings for him, were very well played. The other original characters in the store were perfect because they were trying to get them together. The most touching scene, however, was that of the young couple at his great-grandfather's house. I laughed at times, I cried at some and I really enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I watched it about 5 times. A must see for the total romantics.
