I think the idea of ​​the plot is perfect for first exploring the emotional experiences of the people involved and then, as someone else wrote in a commentary, the implications of this type of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> so ... to start with the second aspect ... for short, it was not visible at all ... <br /> <br /> as for the first .. as I said, there was a lot more potential ... I think this kind of relationship is more tense ... a lot more tension ... and the potential tension has not passed ... < br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack could have been more than a few songs on the background and theme (which was good but not enough and not always at the right time) ... yeah ... I could Feel the lack of better soundtrack .. <br /> <br /> Actors ... I think they were somewhere between 7 and 8/10 ... not enough sensuality in the key moments .. . <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10 .... especially for history
