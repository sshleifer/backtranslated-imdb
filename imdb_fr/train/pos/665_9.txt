"And throughout the house" is a special episode of cryptography, not only because it's the first season, but this episode is the first I've seen! I remember when I was young, I was on vacation with my parents this summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina at HBO. I saw this episode and was buried in the crypt at that time and forever! I have always been a fan of horror and suspense series and loved monster movies. With this series created by HBO, I again had a scary pleasure. This episode being the first one I've seen is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's so nice with a nice twist. "And throughout the house" offers a pleasant and comfortable setting for a snowy winter eve, an ideal way to relax during the holidays! Anyway, Mary Ellen Trainor (who plays in several works of Warner Brothers, usually small roles) is an avid wife of philanthropists who looks after her husband while waiting for money and a new relationship. Only as in most horror series do things turn out to be worse and the bad guys get what they deserve. Chances are huge when a maniac disguised as Santa Claus escapes from a local hazelnut to get ready for Christmas and New Year! From old comics lessons, you learn that bad people have what they want! Well, this story ends with a perfect vacation cry! In addition, this story was part of the 1972 film and featured Joan Collins. This is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypts episodes of all time!
