We all create our own reality, or do we do it? This is the central question of this very original and magisterial examination of the illusory nature of reality. Mixing Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with MC Escher's visual magic, this fascinating treat manages to address the rather cerebral question of "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?", And makes it a captivating and entertaining tour 100 minutes. The film is centered on Bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, "The sea that thinks". While sitting in front of his computer, the work begins to unfold in the form of a description of his sitting position in front of the computer, writing the script. Soon, he is caught in a swirling enigma in which everything he writes becomes a reality. Director Gert de Graaff tackles his subject with a mischievous sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of stunning visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. In the end, De Graaff's film challenges the audience, on many levels, to wonder if everything we see, touch or tease is really what it seems to be, or if all our understanding of the universe and of our place in this one is just a trick played by us. our senses.
