Thanks to a clever scenario and a firm hand of screenwriter / director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very entertaining mystery thriller. The film begins methodically and builds up as clues begin to reveal that nothing is as it seems. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are great because they team up to solve the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles, movies of "Thin Man". Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as a tormented woman and character roles performed by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well done and provide many moments of light at the right time. There is even a cameo from Rex Linn. In total, I felt like reading a good book by the fireside.
