"In Cold Blood", adapted by director Richard Brooks of Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless killing of a family of four by a pair of unlucky criminals. The film excels as a study of the characters of the killers, especially the trigger Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> The distribution includes few recognizable names but nevertheless gives life to the story with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are both criminals with disparate personalities. They play against each other effortlessly, while Blake also takes advantage of many opportunities to explore the specifics of his character. The rest of the distribution is simply average and does not deserve to be mentioned. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks was nominated for the Oscars for his screenplay and directing. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the script miscalculated with misguided narration in the final stages. The cinematography of Oscar-nominated Conrad Hall is also excellent, as is editing. Also worth noting is Quincy Jones' jazzy score, which was the last of four Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime movies, this one does not include violence. Brooks turns killers into pitiful characters rather than categorically condemning them. Whether you agree or disagree with this feeling, the film presents an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are treated.
