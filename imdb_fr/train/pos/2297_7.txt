There is something in every "Hammer" movie I see that really takes me to a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, anything can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of these types of films. He enters occultism and hypnosis to create a different kind of horror. In short, an unforgettable film. 7.5 / 10.
