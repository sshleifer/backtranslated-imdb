The second Care Bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, a better character development, and the tunes (especially the closing song) are both catchy and warm. Of course, the film tends to be too stressful, but hey, it's a Care Bears movie. This film is an excellent image to show to children because it highlights friendship, love and, of course, attention. Not to mention that the Bisounours are too adorable!
