An unpretentious, subtle and slender film, "The Man in the White Suit" is a new breath of fresh air in the film format of Ealing Studios. Although I think that some modern viewers might initially find this obscure, I doubt that many would fail to be seduced by the expert manner of the plot, themes and characters are indiscriminately relayed during the course of the film. Alec Guinness gives another refined description in a film that may not be as virtuosic as Ealing's inspiring "Kind Hearts and Coronets" of 1949. This time, he plays only one character instead of eight, but as the inventor and outspoken scientist Sidney Stratton, he finds the correct tone and expression. With the subtle and expressive performance of Guinness, the rest of the cast is effective. Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out among the main actors. Thesiger is absolutely absurd as a crippled but influential big boss, while Parker is reliable as a father and mill owner, inefficient and yet essential. Father, that is to say Joan Greenwood, a delightfully delightful comic actress, who is at its insurmountable top in this film. Resplendent and seductive in appearance and diction, it is quite sublime in this film, contrasting with Guinness just as unusual but more clumsy. The scene where she apparently tries to tempt him is interpreted so skillfully by the couple that she is both deeply poignant and amusing ... <br /> <br /> The themes are treated very effectively, without easy morals. The complexities of the relationships between science, business and the workforce are examined in a thorough and enjoyable way. This film, technically led by Alexander Mackendrick, is technically competent in all fields. an evocative photograph, sound effects and appropriate music, as well as a melancholy script, impress all others. A very satisfying film, with magnificent Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Note: - **** 1/2 / *****
