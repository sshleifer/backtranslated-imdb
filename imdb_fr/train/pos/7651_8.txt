An interesting TV movie based on real events, betrayed by the description of one of the main characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate task of deciding whether he will appeal to the courts to have his brother sentenced to death. But when he goes to visit him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Koteas' ability to act. It looks like the version of a prisoner with proletarian roots according to "G.Q." magazine, with too sophisticated a language for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This observation came to me after finding an old friend, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, who has spent in several Panamanian prisons. The young man I knew left, not only because of his age, but because of his prolonged exposure to the criminal system. There are prisons and there are prisons, it must be said, but this one, prisoner of "Shot In the Heart", is definitely out of this world.
