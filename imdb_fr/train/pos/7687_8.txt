Like The Jeffersons, Good Times is one of those classic American sitcoms that has never been broadcast in the UK, let alone its 1970s release, a decade in which I have not been born yet . <br /> <br /> But, like most fans of the series, I watched some episodes on You Tube, and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is headed by James and Florida, two parents trying to make ends meet. meet and who, despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own aspirations in life, to realize them and to seize their chances. James was a strict but loving father, who dared not hesitate to discipline J.J., Michael and Thelma, if they crossed the line. Whereas Florida, on the other hand, was a caring and caring mother, as well as a loving wife, although in many ways similar to James, in terms of their attitudes towards parenthood and family values from an African American point of view. <br /> <br /> The kids were as lively and fun as the parents themselves: JJ was a budding artist with a clumsy personality and unusual sense of humor, often wearing colorful outfits and "DY-NO-MITE" slogan is as contagious and familiar as Arnold Jackson Whatchoo's talk about Willis? from Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was the smart-alec, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, while Sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. His verbal taunts with JJ were mostly hilarious, as was the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, which was extremely well performed by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> Over the seasons, a few appearances, including Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman like himself! In fact, I prefer Good Times to The Cosby Show, a show from the 80s because a) I preferred the Evans family to Huxtables, both in terms of a) characterization and b) because I felt that she was addressing serious social issues and difficult, in a way that resonated with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary that aimed to shed light on the lives of working-class African Americans in America in the 1970s. The Cosby Show attempted to meet the expectations of the general public in a "candy coat" manner, the Huxtables being portrayed as blacks who easily assimilated into an American culture of the upper class to which we would associate the Whites, while Good Times was much more contrasted. "edgier" and he is not afraid to deal realistically with topics such as drug abuse and child abuse. In fact, I found that although the Cosby Show can be fun to watch from time to time, it lacked the Good Times' "sassiness" and made it more trendy and cool. <br /> <br /> The show has taken a leap forward shark in recent seasons, as it continued after the character of John Amos, James died in an abnormal accident (in fact, it was known to the time that John had left Good Times for good, the death of his character was then written as such on the show). Without John, the show suffered and, alas, he lost much of his charm. <br /> <br /> Yet for a sitcom, Good Times met all the criteria. If only they had shown it in the UK in the 80s. How it certainly is, as JJ would say, 'DY-NO-MITE !!' <br /> <br /> My note: 8 years and a half
