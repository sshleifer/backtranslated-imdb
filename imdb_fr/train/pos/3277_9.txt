This film is fantastic because it explores storytelling and fantasy like a child, for an adult. The idea that a child's drawings become a place where they can physically visit and on which to influence is fantastic. At the same time, you can ask all child psychologists to say that she is really exploring her subconscious, as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. What gives me goosebumps is when her father is in the paper house and pursues her. The only thing I can not stand is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... that's really not the case. If you want to see something British with a lot of history that will let you guess without the cheap thrills that most movies have to use, then look at Paperhouse.
