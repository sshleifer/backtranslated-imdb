I was able to see this film in preview and I was dazzled. This is not the typical romantic comedy. I do not remember laughing so much at a film and being moved by it. The laughs are not gags here are observations, recognition of laughter, small shocks "Oh, God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I will not give the plot, which is more than just "Guy falls for the girlfriend of his brother." Here, the whole family plays a role in the relationship. Probably the best mixture of laughter and warmth since "While You Were Dorming". <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much further than before, and for the first time I really loved him. The cast is incredible, a list of veteran theater actors I loved in other roles, but that mix to form a compelling family. Dianne Wiest is charming as her mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), And even Dane Cook, venerated, gives a warm performance, quiet and touching. The soundtrack by Sondre Lerche is a great addition, and I will buy the CD when it becomes available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one.
