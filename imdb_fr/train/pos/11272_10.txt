108: Tarzan and his companion (1934) - published on 20/04/1934, accessed 8/06/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and steals a bank in Iowa. Bonnie & Clyde killed two police officers on the road in Texas. BIRDS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin and Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After being rather disappointed by the first movie "Tarzan, the man with apes", we discovered that the second movie "Tarzan and his companion" was the best of the series. It is true. I have a huge kick of this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as a wild superhero who dominates the vineyard and sways in the vineyards. Maureen O'Sullivan returns to her role as a truly fantastic lady, Jane (who wears a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). In my review of 'Ape Man', I tramped Jane pretty well for her obsession with clothes and her incessant shrieks, but she redeemed herself for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie and Jane is the most capable character in the cast. She plays the role of ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can work perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals. She knows how to ward off a mad pride of lions when she runs out of bullets. She even has her own jungle cry now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She totally trained him. Cheeta is just as charming, pulling Martin's cigarette. The plot is mainly an excuse for Tarzan to fight the most vicious animals in the jungle, including lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects, while still visible, are much more dynamic and fun and complement the action. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. Regarding the pre-coded action / adventure, nothing better than "Tarzan and his companion". The inevitable sequel to Tarzan, the monkey man, is an unbridled, violent and risky epic in the jungle. I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that does not make prisoners like this. You would find it difficult to find in this film a complete scene that would be approved by the Code or by Animal Rights. The macabre violence does not even wait for the happy jungle couple to show off before pushing the boundaries of today's adventure cinema. And after T & J come on the scene, there are many morning hugs and nude swimming in the afternoon. See for yourself if you do not believe me. I especially like Maureen O'Sullivan in this film. In the first film, Jane seemed to be a walking contradiction, as if the writers of the time did not know how to describe a character like that. But here she is a good precursor for kicking the movie women later. Although she still needs Tarzan's help to get her out of most traffic jams, she's doing more than just waiting to be saved. Her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who lives (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I watched it with my mother and I liked to show her how Jane was trained by Tarzan, as Jeff Foxworthy said. She has totally ape man to her every beck and call. Although there is a host of optical effects dated throughout the film, there are still plenty of terrifying battles against Tarzan against predators that are (for the most part) conducted for real. That and men dressed like monkeys are much more convincing this time around. ** SPOILER ** The film culminates as the jungle bursts with a shocking orgy of violence in the animal kingdom leaving Tarzan and Jane the only two human beings breathing. Although the couple walks away at sunset, reunited and victorious, I can not help but imagine what this story will look like for the next safari that will hear about the previous group of humans who went to get Tarzan and Jane and they never heard of it again. ** END OF SPOILER ** One of the things that bothers me is Johnny Weissmuller's hair-free softness and nape and over-styled headdress. Apart from that, this is a pre-code adventure-action not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Last film: It was a night (1934). Next movie: Twentieth Century (1934).
