Personally, I liked this film and I am alarmed by the classification that some people have attributed to him. It's a cartoon-based movie and it's animated, now if you do not like comics or animation, then of course you will not like this movie, so why did you watch and I took the trouble to evaluate it. However, if you are a fan of Strong and Interesting Characters and Heroic (Sexy) Women, you will love this movie. I thought the story really attracted me and it was a very cool movie. Pretty anime-esque or more like some of the American movies that follow this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. is the live version of Punisher. In the end, I highly recommend this movie to comic fans and superhero fans or to anyone with an open mind and looking for a fun movie.
