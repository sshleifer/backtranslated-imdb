First an explanation on what makes a good movie for me. The excitement of not knowing what will happen will make me appreciate a movie the first time I look at it (box point: Twister). There are also other things that go into a good first listen as the good mood (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), a good scenario with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), an imaginary narrative (all episodes of Star Wars, George Lucas is THE MAN) and good music (still all episodes of Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times at the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. That said, I introduce Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performances Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is excellent and very funny and / or comforting. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon. The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflict and a very good theme (I can not start because I do not want to ruin it). Jim Carrey was very funny in The Grinch, especially when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his selection of instruments and compositions. Very good job, Jim Carrey - I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. On your solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds? It looks like an F #? It is an obscene range for a 7 year old (obscene meaning in the best possible way). Good work. It's the best performance of a child I've ever heard in a movie (Taylor beat the children of Von Trapp, it's not an easy task!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was awesome, funny and surprisingly very sensitive (it really shows in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). The unspoken expressions of Taylor Momsen (one of the secrets of a good acting performance) are very strong - she really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when she talks, she is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** danger: alert spoil ******** ************* *************************** ********** ********************************* <br /> <br /> Examples: expression when she sees The Grinch for the first time. Classic quote ("You are the" and then completed by the Grinch line "da da da THE GRINCH - after which she switches to the sorter and is saved by The Grinch.) The" Thank you for saving me "quote and The Grinch's subsequent response was also very good. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be a Holiday Cheermeister.This scene is two excellent actors that Little Taylor Momsen completely resists with Jim Carrey I sincerely hope that we will see Taylor Momsen in many other upcoming movies, so in short, everything was great about this movie (except perhaps the feet and the nose).
