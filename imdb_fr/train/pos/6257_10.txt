This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely incredible. I saw it tonight on the Turner Classic Movie channel. I think I'll see if I can order a copy on DVD. The sequences are not blurry or jerky, unlike the 1925 black-and-white silent film. Taking place in Iran in 1925, the nomadic tribes of the documentary leave their desert to cross a raging river, men, women, children, animals ... Then, a snowy mountain passes Barefoot. It's sinking or swimming and climbing or dying. In search of grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man carries a mule too sick to climb the mountain. The children of the documentary all look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran still live like this. Make you appreciate modern life in the United States.
