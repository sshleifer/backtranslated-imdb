"Dick Tracy" is one of our family's favorites - the actors are great - the artistic direction is exceptional - the music is magical. It's not supposed to be "To Kill A Mockingbird" - it's a fun experience. <br /> <br /> The songs of Stephen Sondhemim are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Sooner or Later" is just, "What Can You Lose" haunts - even tunes like "Live Alone and Like" It "add to the history <br /> <br /> We must love the incredible performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, who support the bad guys .. The list is way too long. And yes, even Madonna and Warren Beatty are great. Wrote with a smile for a minute (how many times we looked at each other and said, "Wait a minute - I have a thought - let's go!"). <br /> <br /> However, one of the most telling things in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having fun - and this adds up to the pleasure of the audience. So, if you have not done so already, why not give Dick Tracy a chance - accept him for what he is - an animated Sunday cartoon - and in a wonderful way!
