We do not often take advantage of this jewel, the Invisible Ray of 1936. But nobody can forget it. The story is elegant. Karloff, austere and embittered in his Carpathian retreat, is Janos Rukh, a genius scientist who reads ancient beams of light to learn about the events of the great geological past, particularly the crash of a powerful radioactive meteorite in Africa. The always elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies "astrochemistry". Frances Drake is the underutilized young beautiful woman; Frank Lawton the romantic temptation; and the divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a show worthy of Maria Ospenskya. <br /> <br /> The story advances quickly in bold episodes, with special effects always so beautiful. It also contains some wonderful lines. A Rukh restores the sight of his mother, he asks: "Mother, do you see, do you see?" "Yes, I can see more clearly than ever, and what I see scares me." Even better when Mother Rukh says, "He broke the first law of science." I am not the only one among my friends to ask me for many years what exactly this first law of science is. <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly an empty island material.
