This beautiful story of an eldest son coming home and learning to love and be part of all the things he has left home to get away from is poignant and moving. This shows a society that may be strange to us in the western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad and sometimes funny and comical. There is a sense of realism that we no longer seem to see in our Western films. <br /> <br /> The acting is unusual, in that as the film progresses, it almost gives the impression that it is not. act, but a documentary of ordinary people. It is a brilliant achievement and achievement. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more films from this director.
