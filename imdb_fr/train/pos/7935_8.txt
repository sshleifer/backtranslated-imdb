Hood of the Living Dead still had a lot to do before the opening credits. First, any game about "... the undead" invokes His Holiness Mr. Romero and instantly sets a high standard that many movies can not afford to aspire to. And secondly, my filmmate claimed that any urban horror film would go beyond the seminal Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptics, we settled down to watch. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere zombie movie and good heart. Oh, yes, the budget is low and, of course, the amateur friends of the directors populate the cast, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yeah. But when it's so cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE is. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a laboratory during the day and as a surrogate parent of his younger brother at night. He dreams of leaving Oakland. However, before this planned escape, his brother is shot dead. Ricky's scientific mind presents a superior option to CPR or 911: injections of the experimental regenerative formula from his lab. Unfortunately, little brother wakes up in an ambulance in the form of a bloodthirsty zombie from Oakland! Chaos and chaos! I think it's more economical to eat enemies than to get revenge by car, but again, I'm a bad judge of the complexities of urban life. (What a mediocre judge?) In response to a bloody scene involving four men, I said, "Ah-ah, white t-shirts on everyone, blood is visible." Economical! I used the same in my own low-budget horror movie "Jordan replied," No, it's a gang dress, white t-shirts have been banned from New Orleans bars for a while. " <br /> <br /> Much of the film takes place in a living room, so there is a lot of hanging out and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are friendly and the film is sincere - it exceeds its budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Explanation of the zombies: When the man plays God, zombies appear! Or maybe: Follow the FDA-approved test rules before human experimentation! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the Zombie Cannon: This is the first zombie movie I saw with a driving shot. As for zombies, the infection spreads with a bite as usual, but very rarely the blows to the head do not work - they are heart attacks that kill. Zombies have legumes whose absence proves real death. And these zombies make jaguar-grunt noises pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Free zombie movie in joke: a mercenary named Romero. Groan. <br /> <br /> Favorite zombie: the little brother Jaguar-noise zombie, of course!
