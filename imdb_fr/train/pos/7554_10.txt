First, this movie lasts 34 minutes, which means you can watch it three times in a row while spending less time than most other movies. Second, you must do it. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrible but still powerful images. Cats riding and drinking in a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has eaten the sky and pigs eating their own fried flesh - that's just the beginning. The scenes and the images, extraordinary by themselves, come together without any obvious causal link, which requires a new visualization. In addition, the DVD contains a commentary by the incredible director, who, given the dialogue extremely spared, only improves the viewing. The commentary gives some interpretations of scenes, but also provides invaluable quotes on the making of Cat Soup, in the following sense: "Well, the artists were asking what we had to do in this scene, but I did not know myself, so it's hard to say why it turned out like that "(it's a bad paraphrase in passing). In addition, the sound throughout the film is very high quality, very precise and very dark. All in all, the absolute minimum visual experience should be: <br /> <br /> First Reading: Watch the DVD without the comment. Second viewing: Watch the DVD with the comment. Third viewing: Rewatch without the comment. <br /> <br /> Once you have watched it three times, you will not stop there.
