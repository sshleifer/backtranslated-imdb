It's a heartbreaking western and I've watched it many times and it's entertaining at every level. However, if you want to know the real facts about legends such as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane, then look elsewhere, as John Ford suggested the truth becomes legend print legend. History is moving at a frantic pace, and there is a good dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur, two very observable stars who help make this film. The piercing eyes among you might well see Gabby Hayes Anthony Quinn debuts as a Cayenne warrior. He married one of Demilles' daughters in real life. His character from Quinns actually informs Cooper about the Custer massacre recounted in flashback, the finale is fine It's done and when credits arrive, it fuses the American West with American history. So, please, take the time to watch this classic western.
