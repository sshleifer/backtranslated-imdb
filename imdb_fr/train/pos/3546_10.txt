One of the best musicals ever made, here's an example of where producers and directors were not afraid to choose actors for their talent, rather than what people could expect. The lighting and decor are unique, which gives it a very interesting effect (its name is special, I can not imagine). Dialogue is also unique in that no contraction is used. The film is well paced, beautifully played and interesting from start to finish. A real joy is the music. Such a choice of first-rate songs, from beginning to end, perfectly interpreted and orchestrated. In addition, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think superior to many musicals from the thirties to the sixties. He certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which could only have two or three. Not bad for a director without experience in this type of film. Another quality is that it is fresh every time you see it.
