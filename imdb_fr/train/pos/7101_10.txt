Contrary to popular belief, this title, at least for me, is not so bad. In reality. I consider it a favorite film of all time. The solder of stories was not too structured when you consider the differences between the series but, nevertheless, one can look at it with a certain joy. For a feature film of his time, the scenes are well proportioned and the characters are still credible. <br /> <br /> The audio / sound track is one of my personal favorites. Almost everything has a good sound effect and many voices are better suited to the characters than their dub US counterparts, now poorly launched. The timing is perfect with every shot. I had some problems with casting for 'extraterrestrial' voices (please forgive the brutal name, it's been a long time since I've seen it). Otherwise, the distribution seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters in this movie. Duplicates are often a subject with which I rarely agree. I loved the OSD of the time, but the castings have often dropped the series. <br /> <br /> At this point, I would like to add that it was one of the first anime I saw in my life. It has historical value for me, but even after seeing the original version of Megazone 23, it stayed stronger and more looked into my collection. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, this title has never been awarded to the United States in Texas. Personally, I think it's a shame. If the target audience had been the subject, I think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years. Every day of my life, I'm involved in cartoons and everyone I showed this movie to think it was a well-edited title. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its various components will allow the viewer to notice the obvious plot. holes between shows. However, without seeing the originals, the viewer would not really notice it. Since the style of the animation is the same, there was no reason to question it at the time. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser discs were the most productive medium. Personally, I like the way Carl had the courage to push at least the genre. I mean, Harmony was not going to give the money to make the show public. <br /> <br /> Despite the few hard mistakes that people have made with this film, the feeling of the eighties keeps me in love. If you watch Megazone 23 now, with its original Japanese audio, or the new sound, I think you will be greatly disappointed with the OSD. Think about the soundtrack of Bubblegum Crisis Dub and imagine a new 80's sound on E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Say it all. The popularity of this film today is probably due to its rarity in the free market. Personally, this has spawned a collection for me. I now travel the world looking for products from all three components and if I ever met Carl Macek, shake his hand for the effort and buy him a pint or a box to take me to anime.
