OKAY. Who brought the cheese. I like that. During his race, it became a phenomenon. Anorexic twins have become popular. Bob Saget started making a paycheck (instead of his REALLY funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. It was then that life was beautiful and simple. It's one of the great American classics. It was fun and always brought a good lesson at home. And that's where I differ from the norm: I liked the last seasons. Just like Home Improvement, when you write, you can do a lot more with the script when your kids are growing up. That's why I dare say ... It could have been much later than expected. But whatever. I gave him a 8/10 because of his healthy and funny stories, and because of Bob Saget!
