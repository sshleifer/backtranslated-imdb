I saw Saving Grace right after it was released on video. Since then, it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex but it does not detract from entertainment. It's a group full of funny moments and a very endearing quality. The characters are what makes the movie so good. Each has its own odd qualities, which adds to the humor, recall the two old ladies embodied by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law. The superb game was made by all, especially Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson have been great together to make some of the most fun moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie!
