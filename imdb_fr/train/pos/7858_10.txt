TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is probably the best film of all Mary Pickford movies. At two o'clock, it was long enough for a silent film of 1922 but continues to arouse your interest some 80 years after its shooting. Mary sometimes gives one of her best performances, her role looks like a performance of "great success" with fragments of Mary the innocent, Mary the little devil, Mary the little mother, Mary the sword, Mary the romantic heroine etc. have been used in a single film in the past. The film is surprisingly straightforward about the illegitimate child of a secondary character in 1922 and at one point we think our little Mary is the single mother in question! If the Oscars had existed in 1922, this year's Academy Award for Best Actress would probably have been Mary's.
