As a child, I preferred the first Care Bear movie, which looks so dark. I always sat down and watched first. As I got older, I learned to prefer this one. What I think is that this film is too dark for infants, but as you get older, you learn to cherish it because you understand it better, it does not seem as dark as it was when you were a child. <BR /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is so much deeper. This may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one. The Cubs are too adorable, I rewind this scene "Flying My Colors". I tend to annoy everyone by singing it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent! A big hand to Carol and Dean Parks. I love all the songs in this movie, I downloaded them all and that's all I listen to, I'm currently listening to "Our Beginning", also known as "Recalling". I always preferred this sound track to the first one, even though I really like Carol Kings song in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is excellent. both films are fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and watched it about 10 years later and the animation was excellent for the time. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There are not many people who say that this movie is great, but it's true. I do not think it's weird / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film explains how the Bisounours were born and defeated the Dark Heart demon. The end is surprising and beats any 'Pokemon Movie' again with Care Bears Moral numbers. This leaves an effect on you. Once again, this film can teach morality to everyone, at any age.
