I read that it was not good, that the story was not solid, that Volckman felt he had failed. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. First, it is well executed. Volckman does well to try not only a new technique, but also to have a goal that deserves to be thought about: would immortality reduce the value of life? Great question ... <br /> <br /> I can see he is trying to create a feeling, and he is not compromising. This must be applauded. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such form. I have seen artists reduce a shape to the bare minimum to create the intensity of a moment. I identify this film with this. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is much more interesting than the rotophotography of Richard Linklater, and the story of Volckman is more meaningful than his more recent stories of a life wasted by drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many more stories with a lot of holes that do a lot better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really nice work.
