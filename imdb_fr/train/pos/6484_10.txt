I remember watching it in the 1970s - and then I recently borrowed a few episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> After an interruption of nearly 30 years, I came to another conclusion. Most of the directors interviewed in this series - some in the center of power, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (German naval leader) Anthony Eden (United Kingdom) - have long since disappeared, but their stories first hand will live. Sergeants' generals and admirals, Russian civilians, concentration camp survivors are all recorded here. <br /> <br /> I remember the interview of Lord Mountbatten (killed in the 1970s) <br /> <br /> It's really a jewel and I think the producer of this series was Knighted by Queen Elizabeth for this job - well deserved. <br /> <br /> See these few episodes of the library makes me want to buy the whole. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" that I gave his opinion but I already discovered as a good bottle of wine, it is more appreciated with a little time ...
