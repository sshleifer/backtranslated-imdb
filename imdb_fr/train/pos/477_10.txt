Hello everyone, I am a chess enthusiast since about 6 years old. I guess I'm obsessed with chess, but not as much as the central character of this movie. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the central role The character of Curt von Bardeleben, who committed suicide in 1924, is a well-known character. He is famous for a game he played against Steinitz, where a nice combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall without ever going back. <br /> <br /> The social ineptitude of the central character is unfortunately a treat for some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes encounter in chess tournaments. I suppose chess is a very big sacrifice and you can sometimes find yourself unbalanced in other areas of life. The chess legend Bobby Fischer is a prime example. Although great, he was also very disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the film, a world championship match is featured, between a great Italian master and Luzhin. The format is a coup de grace, which Fide's global board sometimes used as the format itself, going from 128 players to only 2 in the final. But it was a group knockout - which also describes a realistic format, in which the winners of each group face each other. <br /> <br /> The position before the adjournment is a fascinating chess puzzler. In fact, I made a video on youtube to allow you to explore in detail the winning combination - enjoy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon
