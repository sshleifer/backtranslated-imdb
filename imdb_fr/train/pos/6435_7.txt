I think most people who posted comments on this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have a weak sense of elegance. First, to evaluate a movie, you need to understand how everything in the movie works together. Modern sensibilities require great dramas. No, I'm not talking about great character sets and intrigues, but they seem to require very tragic or very comical emotional trajectories. It's a subtle film. Its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Neither the story nor the characters are simple in this film. It is a beautifully filmed film that combines sensuality, politics, human weakness, venality, etc. The world in which it unfolds would be strange and misunderstood today ... a world where, if you have it, you have to post it NOW and REALLY, even if you only think of having it. <br /> <br /> Many people Today I do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian because people understand this term today. <br /> <br /> This film helps to make things clear.
