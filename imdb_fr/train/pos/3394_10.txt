I watched this movie by accident, I bought it as a side B of the DVD The Omega Man. The Omega Man was a little disappointing - with the exception of the beginning, which clearly inspired 28 days later, the rest is made up only of television movies. But Soylent Green is in a different league. I bet he's one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie that I have never seen before. Heston lying down with the "furniture" casually while discussing a completely different subject from this one! A whole crowd of people being looted by a fleet of excavators! A priest confessing and being shot by the confessor. Ok, maybe this has been done since - but there are not many films that are so consistently original. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is it the most unlikely gay couple of all time or what? Fortunately, I saw this film without knowing the end, which is apparently rare. Then I watched it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long scenes of the beginning useful. A beautiful script - and some great scenery too. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
