This film blows your feet. This debut film by Tom Barman (known to the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 intriguing people, making up a fascinating mosaic of films. They survive one day and one night in the Antwerp metropolis. Barman paints his characters with great verve and skillfully mixes their individual stories, a tour that recalls the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of anecdotes surprises, moves, amuses; the dialogues are so natural, they seem improvised. Great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely entertaining Duo of Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable "Windman", a strange guy who dances throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the amazing choreography and, of course, Tom Barman has taken care of the ultra-cool soundtrack himself. We were seriously impressed: Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that will leave you speechless.
