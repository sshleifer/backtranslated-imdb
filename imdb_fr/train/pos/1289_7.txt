First of all, the film is an ingenious work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a small child who claims to be an adult has inherited a million dollars and the way he spends it. I mean how crazy that is. Walt Disney really outdid himself this time. The comedy is mostly expected but the other times unexpected. I mean, was this movie OK or was this movie OK? He also learns a lot about the wise youth and me, this kid is really wise and a little clever. But also it sucks. How on earth could a guy like this kid have a sexy police baby and his dad let him go free? It's like letting a killer be released on bail for ten years. If I did, I would fight with a "double jack" (a huge stick that stings when used to put your buttocks on the ground very hard). This kid is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made this film but it's still not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The child and the woman had no chemistry, any more than the father, but the brothers were excellent. The special effects were however lame. Moreover, this film is not based on reality. I hated and loved at the same time.
