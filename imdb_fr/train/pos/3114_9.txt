I will keep it short enough to not spoil anything for you. This movie is great. From beginning to end, it is filled with thrills. The fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are captivating, and the pace is so fast that things are really slow only when things are explained. Damon shines and has proven to be a very strong actor, challenging you not to believe him in this role. It is this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (hoping I wrote that very right) as a shady agent of the CIA to kill Bourne. This is nonstop and will really leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things in the end are a little sneaky, canceling a mark of 10. The end is left open for the suites and I hope they will consider doing more, because none was bad . Excellent film overall and fantastic conclusion of an incredible trilogy. <br /> <br /> P.S. The shaky camera did not hurt the action, but I still think we could do without it. The good news is that you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action.
