Unfortunately not yet available on DVD, but it is worth continuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes that her boss is wrongly accused of murder and bravely attacks many dangerous characters in order to establish the truth. A movie with lots of twists and dark alleys, I will not mention any! The sequence of the jazz band where our heroine searches for information about the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, albeit a low-budget, black-and-white film made during the Second World War. Despite the small budget - Long Island looks a bit mountainous - it's a film with an original style and exceptional vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew a lot about it. She represented the wildest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall and Ann Sheridan - of their day. Robert Siodmak was one of the German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. Unfortunately, Ella Raines has never had such an important role and ends up in poorly produced westerns.
