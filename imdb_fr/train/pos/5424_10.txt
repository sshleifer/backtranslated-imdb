"Gunga Din": one of the greatest adventure stories ever told! A story about the British foreign legion in the 19th century in India and a humble "water carrier" named Gunga Din, a city dweller who aspires to be like his military counterparts; three British sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie for each other go far beyond patriotism. It is a true and lasting friendship for everyone and everyone would be willing to sacrifice their own life for the sake of the other. Gunga Din also aspires to be a soldier, especially a bugle, but can never reach that rank because of his subordinate social status. However, heroes are not made according to their social references, but their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. Gunga Din tries at each turn to prove his courage, but will he ever reach the rank he so passionately seeks? ... "You are a better man than me, Gunga Din"! One of the Hollywood classics and a perfect 10 !!!!
