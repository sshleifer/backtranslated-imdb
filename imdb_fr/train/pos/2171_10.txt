A real classic, ten out of ten! Each actor is perfect, the scenario is a haunted succession of scenes full of suspense. The scenes in the car and the scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. I wonder if this film is already released on DVD, because it must be seen in Widescreen version. I saw this movie in the late '50s, maybe three or four times, and I've never forgotten it since. I remember it was one of Warner's first feature films, a process called Warnerscope that gave a great cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I can criticize is not having been led by someone like Nicholas Ray, for example, to increase the pace and the tension.
