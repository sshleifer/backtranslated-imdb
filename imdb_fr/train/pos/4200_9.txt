Samuel Fuller's van on South Street is abnormal: a hysterical "Red Scare" movie, in which the Communist threat is none other than McGuffin's which ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her portfolio containing a microfilm tape; Unbeknownst to one of them, it contains secrets essential to the cold war. Peters, as it is, was watched by FBI agents who were as disconcerted by the flight as the man who directs it, the cowardly comsympic Richard Kiley. In trying to recover the precious film, both parties sought the help of Thelma Ritter, a very noisy old Jane, always on the lookout and eager to sell what she heard. <br /> <br /> Fuller draws on an opulent palette of tempos and tones in the narrative of the story, which becomes a race against the clock of increasing brutality. From the metro to the waterfront, its Manhattan summer takes a burst of sweat almost spicy. The scenes of love between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mix of tumultuous and tender, and are interpreted as follows: "Again", song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House, also interpreted by Widmark. The scene of death beautifully written and interpreted by Ritter is slowing down - among the most poignant vignettes of all blacks, and a sort of mirage-oasis in a movie thirsty for sentimentality. This is the only work of the writer / director Fuller in the strictest limits of the black cycle; his later explorations of American pathology (the Purple Kimono, the Nude Kiss, Underworld USA) have never resulted in a synthesis as satisfactory as that of Pickup on South Street.
