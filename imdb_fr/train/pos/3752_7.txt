This film is unusual and weird, and it is almost unusual and weird in a very good sense. I give this short film a 7 just because it is so unique and offbeat, but most of the time, it seems to me that it's weird, just to be weird. If the film had managed to integrate its most bizarre moments into a semblance of intrigue, it would have been really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it seems that the creators have mixed. shit about spatulas, then thrown in a whole lot more shit that sounded like it would sound funny coming from the mouth of a spatula. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth checking out, but it's not top rate by any wild imaginative ray of the creators.
