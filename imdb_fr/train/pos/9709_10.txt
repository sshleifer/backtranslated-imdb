One night, while watching TV, I stumbled upon the LoG: I have never missed an episode since. <br /> <br /> His humor is very strange, like a cross between the social commentary of Brass Eye, the excellent Fast Show one-liners, and an incredible plot that seems to develop every week without ever going anywhere. The best example of this was Hillary Briss's special stuff - what was it? <br /> <br /> Humor will not please everyone. Some will say it's too sick and it's easy to see where they come from. Nevertheless, try it. If you do not like it, do not look at it, but if you like it, you'll be very happy to have followed my advice.
