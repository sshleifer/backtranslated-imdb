I was really impressed by this movie. The writing was fantastic and the characters were rich and simple. It is very easy to attach emotionally to each of them. The creators of this film have really put their finger on it to create real life characters and bring the viewer to be sucked into their world. Plus, the music is great. They used freelancers to do the score and part of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding film. If you have the chance to see this film in a small theater or at a film festival (as I did), I highly recommend you to go see it. In addition, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this film. This is reason enough to go check it.
