I do not want to comment on the quality of the film or its flaws, because I'm not a professional film critic and I do not know enough about the filmmaking profession. What I do know is that doing this kind of film right from the very beginning is a great achievement and I would like to congratulate the director. However, in some critics I read, some critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and that his siblings had been completely erased from the story. Now, I really would like to raise a point here: as the title of the film indicates, it's not a movie about Hiralal's brothers, it's a film about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, Nothing more, nothing less. If we start complaining about the persistence of characters in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters do not fit into the picture, no matter how relevant they are in real life. So I think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop a criticism within ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
