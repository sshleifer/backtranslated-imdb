I have already seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In this film, the scenery takes place in the Chinese mountains, the legend of Zu looks like another dimension! Thanks to Tsui Hark for his intensive use of CGI effects. He is able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from sharp wing blades, slotted swords and the ultra-cool Orb of the Moon. many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The novel aspect is there, although the film seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this film interesting to watch. At first I like how she looks like the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she plays Enigma well as she faces her past life. Oh, by the way, did I already say that Cecilia was very attractive to the eye ?? <br /> <br /> In truth, Zu Warriors had more elements of comedy and its special effects were limited because of its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes a whole new level and sets a new standard in the cinema.
