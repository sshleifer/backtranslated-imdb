My daughter is really taken aback when I talk about Drew Barrymore as if she had been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention her chin Dudley Dooright for which Jay Leno would die. What a marvel, then, when I discovered in "Fever Pitch" that I loved Miss Barrymore very much; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best described as a sweet and light comedy. To be absolutely stereotyped, the girls will love the film for its romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will love it for all the masculine links and the representation of the sports mania. <br /> <br /> woman, my teenage daughter and I all found something to love in the movie. That says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend about an hour and a half and it's probably a very good date.
