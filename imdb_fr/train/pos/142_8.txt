The second part (actually episodes 4 to 8) of the Danish hit TV series is slightly inferior to the first, but it is full of laughter and fears. This time, Udo Kier plays two roles: the baby monster and his demon father. Dr. Krogshoj of Søren Pilmark, who is facing the horrible revenge of Dr. Helmer, is another remarkable piece from this era. Once again, the patient, Mrs. Drusse tries to solve the mysteries, in the manner of Miss Marple. Ends on a cliffhanger and after the death of the main actors Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), you wonder how they can do Part III, but I hope that Von Trier will give it's a knock. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, the No. 2 Down syndrome dishwasher, passed away soon after. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
