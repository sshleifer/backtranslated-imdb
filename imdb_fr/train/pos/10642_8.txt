I just watched Detention last night and liked what I saw. It was a fun and fun movie.Dolph looked super cool on the bike. He also looked great in this movie compared to his other recent movies. I would not call this film its best, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But he also had his share of problems. The first was the way the bullets flew everywhere and even when they were fired point blank, they missed the target. Another problem I had was how students swore. I do not know in which school students can swear in front of their teacher and even in class. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few. There should have been more bad guys. The last problem was undoubtedly the fact that the decor looked tacky, but that was due to the small budget. Overall, the movie was a good movie. I enjoyed it. I would recommend others to watch it. P.S. Now, you are a DEAD policeman beaten. (Some One-Liner were also cool) <br /> <br />
