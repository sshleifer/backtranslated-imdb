It was the best movie I have ever seen on bulimia. This is exactly the reality of bulimia and the fact that it's not always about being lean and dieting. He showed how people with bulimia tend to think of things such as their vision of life, their friends and themselves. The best line and the part that really shows what is the problem with bulimia, is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line really showed a lot about the character and the others with the same problem. He showed that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of everything that has to do with someone else. It has to do with them and them only. This shows that it is time to talk about the person who has the problem instead of concentrating alone. It showed that Beth needed to attract attention at that time and that she needed most of all the attention of her mother.
