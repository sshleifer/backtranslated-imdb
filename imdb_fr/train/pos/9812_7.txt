"The big goodbye" presents the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard posing as a private detective Dixon Hill. This episode creates a kind of standard pattern, repeated several times on TNG, as well as on DS 9 and Voyager. Once inside the holodeck, something is wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances, beyond a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to expand the possibilities of Star Trek and allow a kind of mix of genres. Picard's stories from Dixon Hill are examples of 1940s crime fiction. Their on-screen representation is called Black Film, often with the anti-hero stereotype in mind (see, for example, Chandler's Marlowe stories or the classic "Chinatown" from Polanski). Star Trek never focuses on the story (it's mostly a simple storyline: how do we get out of it), but allows actors to take a different approach to their characters. These "games" Holodeck are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected and, from this point of view, the stories are never valid (but did not Star Trek have any technical or scientific meaning, I mean in addition to the concepts utopian?). <br /> <br /> "The big goodbye" shows a laid-back Patrick Stewart, a McFadden who has never been so beautiful in an episode of Star Trek (at least the first), and Data also has some great scenes ( although I find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp off the wall would have really surprised him, because he had researched this period and its customs). Wesley continues to turn peaceful Trekkies into potential murderers (why did not they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish it?) But all in all, it's fun ...
