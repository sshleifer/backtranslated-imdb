It's one of the best comedy / musical comedy "B" I've seen (and since I'm in my forties and I only see him now, I'm not an expert, but I'm I saw all the well-known movies out there.) When there are a ton of actors who have their heads for minutes, comedy usually interferes with the music and very often, the music cuts off the flow of comedy. Call me in a crazy state of mind, but when I saw this on TCM Europe, I burst out laughing! So who delivered the laughs for me? Without a doubt, Mischa Auer gave me great laughter, he even stole the end, it was great! Speaking of which, I think this movie works because although L & H is a selling point (and why I became addicted to watching this one (them and Hal Roach), I love them in their debut in Hal Roach), they at least and stay squarely on the ADULT tariff (according to the standards of 1930, and not so far from the standards of today if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch. I admit that I only know him by W O OZ and I loved him there. I also laughed loudly because of his server in the series. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" woman in 1930s movies that really excites me (something tells me she was a fire-eater in real life); and the music numbers have a real quality of professional production (Busby Berkley'ish), which took my breath away from what I'm used to in this genre. I could go on and on and on, but rest assured, I really enjoyed this movie. 8 out of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and I will record it to watch it again with my wife on TCM USA. Good product!
