This film is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a score of 10. The story is about Missouri's famous "Bushwhackers" who fought alongside the South during the interstate war. The clothes they wore were authentic, their story and the reason they fought are very accurate and well documented. There was actually one of the battles that did not happen as they described ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well chosen and were either the brightest or the director really knew how to get the best. I suspect it was a combination of great staging, great casting to find the right people and great performances by the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie was really upset! There is action, romance, suspense, good and bad (sometimes depending on your point of view) and story in a single movie. Even in the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's fine!
