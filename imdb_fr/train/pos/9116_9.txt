The idea is a very intelligent title the film has a serious tongue in the cheek plays to it. But it's so subtle that you do not know how to read it! Are these guys doing a complete comedy or is something else going on? The little dialogue of the film is not very delicate and that adds to the power of the film. If all the sound was cut from the film, it would not take anything away from the movie. The physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it alone carries the whole story. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing and with the blessing, the emotion is followed by shame. I first say this film as part of a festival of "black" movies. After watching the movie, I was so impressed by the work. But then I asked myself what? Where can anyone else see this work? The common association of aimless art is not here. You can see the intention in the design from beginning to end. The use of African music casting style all seems planned and for a reason. The development of the character is incredible. I think casting is the strongest aspect of the film; the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes after the 6 minutes of the actual movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of this type of films, you really need the development of shorts is more important board.
