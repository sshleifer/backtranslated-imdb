I know there are purists who poop for anything that does not look like the original. However, the benefits can sometimes be based on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is quite similar to the Japanese version but at the same time responds to the American spirit. I like Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains things with flying colors. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron leader to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun cooking, commenting and being brilliant when creating. I watched the series and found that all the players work well together. Judges are not always the best choices, though. There are some exceptions, such as the lawyer become greedy, but most judges are questionable in their ability to handle what is served. I like watching chefs and challengers are surprising. The food at the end always looks breathtaking and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. This may be all that everyone can ask, really want to eat what is served. The only thing I would really change in the series is to ask the people in the series to lighten up a bit. Sometimes the atmosphere becomes a little too tense, and it's not always fun to watch when you're expecting more fun. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was so voluminous as the original, but I can say it was a pretty expensive proposition. I would have liked him to stay with this version and be the host, between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, to make me smile for an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and you can accept this series to its merit, you may find it a good time.
