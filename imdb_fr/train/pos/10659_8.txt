"I like cheap perfumes, they do not last that long ..." - Ralph Meeker's (Lawson) convict tells Barbara Barbara's character Helen after he smelled the perfume she had chosen with her husband in Tijuana ...! This sentence made me crack, and also seemed to be a metaphor for this film - say that cheaper is better than expensive, because a cheap man, who likes perfumes and who has style with a 2 x 4 is a man better in the long run. ! I agree with some of the other comments on Helen's attraction to Lawson. Even though her narration says that she wants Lawson to be fired, she seemed attracted by her fiery nature, and the passion she aroused in her would probably not erase the tide!
