I love that movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra does not have the opportunity to sing so much in this film, but it is also nice not to make another film of Frank Sinatra. where it is especially he who sings. <br /> <br /> I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice because he had the right voice and I could not see anyone with that great voice pull the sensation gangster. in his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye "Sit down, you're rockin the boat" is a foot-tappin ', sing a long one that I just love. It's hard to follow with his version and I still like it the best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is just great in this part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite song. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have considered it first, but after seeing it in the role, it made sense. <br /> <br /> The choreography of Michael Kidd is timeless. If it happened again in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I often find that something is lost between the stage version and the film version, but it kept the mood of the stage. , even if he was filmed. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was well shot. I played in regional versions of this movie and it's one of my favorites from this period.
