"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many brilliant moments. It basically follows the lives of Zorak and Brak who have a normal life and go to school, living in a neighborhood on the style of 50 'sitcoms. The humor and animation of this show are very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode, we could see Meatwad) with weird situations and weird characters. But it's good, it has funny roles. Some of the songs are excellent, others not so much but I like this show. The funniest character is Brak's father. (it's a human, nobody knows why)
