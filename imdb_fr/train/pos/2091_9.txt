What Irving Thalberg did today to make this film will never be attempted again. Make a Chinese story with Western players even if they are the same caliber as Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly, among others. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's partly because the story was written by a Westerner, Pearl Buck received a Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Ms. Buck, daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably made China closer to the conscience of America than any other person. Not the political struggles of China, but the everyday life and toil that we find in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, later, Pearl Buck became the apologist of Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang China in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of his literary output has never equaled The Good Earth. <br /> <br /> Peter Ustinov describes very well the comparison between China and Australia from China to Australia. When asked what the difference was, Ustinov said that China was very big and very complete and that Australia was very big and very empty. This is what you see in The Good Earth, a very large and densely populated China, more than it can sometimes withstand. <br /> <br /> Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who buys a woman from a big house where she was a slave. The O-Lan wife (Luise Rainer) gives him two sons and sees him through all the good and the bad times, drought, famine, revolution and an invasion of climatic grasshoppers. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars to represent O-Lan. It may have set some kind of record as it must be the most important performance of the Oscars with as little dialogue as possible. All she does practically with facial expressions, her performance could have been on a silent movie with very minimal subtitles. I think only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter had fewer words and he was playing with a man with a mental disability. <br /> <br /> Muni does not always appreciate his support in this predominantly male culture. Rainer helps on the ground, carries and raises children, cleans up. When Muni becomes a man of property, he takes a second Chinese trophy woman who makes him a lot of sorrow. Still Rainer stoically supports everything. Yet Muni is not a bad man and it's a tribute to Buck's film, his interpretation and his writing that says you do not hate him and that the cultural gap is filled. <br /> <br /> We now have a group of oriental players who do more than Kung Fu movies. I am surprised that the good ground of all movies has not been redone at this stage. I bet the Chinese government would even let a US company do it on a real site. <br /> <br /> Until then, we have this great classic to appreciate and appreciate.
