Street Fight is a brilliant, brutal satire. It's not a movie you watch for pleasure. It's not a comfortable experience, although there are moments of laughter. It's a movie you watch when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> To reject this film as simply racist is to miss the mark. It's not just a satire of Song of the South, it's also a scathing commentary on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group described in the film is presented as a grotesque caricature of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker shows just how absurd these deeply held beliefs are. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who is ready to recognize the ugliness of the prevailing prejudices still prevailing, and if you are not afraid to look at your own prejudices in the eyes, this movie is to be for you.
