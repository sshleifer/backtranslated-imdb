I watched a movie today and it really blew me away. It's a true masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's hogwash. The main idea of ​​the film - Remove your ego and you will have the real power! It was the main battle at the end of the film and Guy Ritchie showed it in a magnificent way. "The biggest enemy will hide in the last place you look at" - do you remember that in the movie? Because our real enemy is in us - it's our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give, but only to take, that creates our aggression, that wants to be in control, it creates all the feelings and negative thoughts. GR has expressed this idea in an amazing way and has shown that the only way to truly control is to lose control and let go of personal importance. A superb movie!
