The more I watch Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Looking at this film now (in 2005), I find that it does not really fit into the kind of film that came out in the early '90s. I do not really think it can be considered a film noir, but sometimes it's very dark, mainly because of the lighting and strange personalities of the characters. <br /> <br /> Typical performances of each of the three main film actors, who have all done a good job with their roles. However, I thought that the characters of Hopper and Boyle were not developed, because it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is a love for him or hates him, kind of guy. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts very unrealistic, I had to hand them over to the director (ie when he saw the sheriff for the first time). Overall, this movie is definitely worth watching. *** 1/2
