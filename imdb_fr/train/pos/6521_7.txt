Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found it to be an interesting movie. Although the details can be "dramatized", the general story is a good start. In addition, I found actors identified that I knew a real pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a despicable corpse? I'll let the rest of the star spot you. As for the secondary cast, this film (as you would expect from a film shot in the late thirties) has a lot of nice character actor, but I want to congratulate Peavey, the right arm of Andrew Jackson. The perfect touch of comedy. Well done, with beautiful ships and a competent acting, I recommend it to all those who love the camp or who have the eye for a double period piece, defined at the dawn of America and realized in a time when Names and prominent actors were a real pleasure.
