I saw the description of the film on TCM and I only let it work because I love Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked the film and that I found it quite exceptional. Of course, it is seriously dated, but as a period piece, it is worth looking for the subtle humor that allows for a better understanding of life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so that I can watch it more often. I was also very impressed by the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the lead role, as well as by Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and the appearances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
