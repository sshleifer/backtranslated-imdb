BASEketball is indeed a really fun movie. David Zucker managed to make us all laugh again, in a comedy really stupid, but often intelligent. <br /> <br /> The two creators of South Park, the main actors of this film, play very well, surprisingly good in fact, but this is the first time I consider them as actors. The film often reminded me of South Park - one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> It's a really good and fun movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
