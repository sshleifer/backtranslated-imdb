This film has a powerful philosophical end. But this end only makes sense if you watch the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The alienation of youth in the late 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of "Zabriskie Point". Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much experience in acting, which reinforces the film's message. Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them. <br /> <br /> This film is not based on a scenario. With the exception of the first ten minutes, it is mainly visual, with breathtaking cinematography. The beautiful naturalistic images seem from another world and perfectly in phase with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would have replaced Pink Floyd's thematically weak music with the more convincing music of The Doors. Many scenes claim "Riders On The Storm". <br /> <br /> Still, I like this movie. It's different; it's unique, it's artistic and imaginative. And the desert badlands are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, "Zabriskie Point" seems more and more attractive. It reflects the atmosphere of the late 1960s in America. It's incredibly artistic, in a bohemian style. And the last eight minutes of the film are philosophically hypnotizing.
