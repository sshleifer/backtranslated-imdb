I have seen this film more than once now, and there is always someone who complains about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards. But then - this is part of Petzold's game: he plays with the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> It's very nice to see how the very unlikely story of the meeting of the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) In another story, even more unlikely, the girls are catching up for a casting. This film is a journey between reality and fiction, it is more about potential, things that could have happened in the past or could happen in the future, than things that really happen. It is a reverie, a kind of - so apt that there are many motives, Freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis, like all the constellations of "doppelganger". <br /> <br /> I also think that "Gespenster" might be interesting to look at astonishing Asian cinema: Petzold's everyday urban architecture is also haunted in a discreet and strangely familiar way. This film is not obvious. Describe this as the story of two girls who meet and finally become friends and lovers, or the story of an orphaned mother, who seeks Europe to find her lost daughter, clearly does not say much at all on the nature of "Gespenster".
