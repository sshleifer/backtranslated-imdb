I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and everything is over. The characters of the firm did not really appreciate their "real" life, but they had fun, that is to say what they were. The film did a good job, making this simple day a good memory. A good memory does not only include romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but also deeper discussions about their values ​​of life. Many movies are like that in terms of the discussion of definitions of life, love, relationships, current problems of life, or some other kind. Before Sunrise has treated it in a pleasant way, the viewer pauses, thinks, adjusts his breath and continues to watch the movie. Before Sunrise tries to make you think. It simply made you think about some of the problems of everyday life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical complaints or stupid ideas. You would always be thinking about these problems for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. The end was not very important after all. You could get something and feel something positive or positive after the movie. The movies are supposed to be nice. It's a nice movie and worth your time to watch it. I am also traveling. The film was a kind of part of me and answered some of my questions.
