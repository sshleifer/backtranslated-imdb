It was a very good movie, I liked it. I thought that bulimia was very well perceived and that it was not a matter of dieting, but of feeling so deep a pain that they had to find a way to solve the problem and they chose that. Beth was a very well-drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mother about the eating disorder, you can see the pain in her and hear her in her voice and you know how much pain she feels is deep. I also think that one of the best replicas of the movie is the one where Beth shouts, "It's not about you." to his mother. These words were so true and added a lot to the movie scene. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in this movie.
