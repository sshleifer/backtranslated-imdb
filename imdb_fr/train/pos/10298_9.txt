For my part, I was happy to see Jim Carrey in a film where the goal was not exaggerated. His character is like all of us. Want more - better things happen to us and expect God to deliver. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman has created a great God. With a sense of humor and a sincere love for all of us, ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> I thought that Jennifer Aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry. The TV presenter centered on himself wants to be, but that's how the writing was written. <br /> <br /> I think the previews ruined several potentially very amusing scenes, as everyone who saw them knew what was going to happen before that happened. <br /> <br /> I read a number of reviews and it seems that some people look a bit too deep. This is a summer comedy that does not aim to solve the world's problems, even if there are some messages we could all take to heart. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
