I'm not at all scary about horror movies and I'm willing to watch just about any one. This does not mean that I am ready to see many, or that I will not criticize them. This film is scary, and is very well done. In fact, I think this movie would make an excellent double bill with Session 9. <br /> <br /> I should clarify, before coming to my comments, that I watched this alone. I started watching the movie before going to bed and took about 15 minutes before realizing it was too effective. So I kept the rest for the morning. Even looking at him in broad daylight, he was always scary. However, I can not guarantee its effectiveness when monitoring a larger group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, a couple settled in an isolated cabin to try to join him. terms with this death. Let me take note of this death - it's one of the few films that does not fear the death of a child. This is much more important because it sets the tone and largely explains the acting that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> The couple is not well. The woman has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back. Although some comments complained about their behavior, one of them said they acted more like a father and a girl than a husband and wife, and that is legitimate. He tries to give him more direction. It's a role that men play sometimes. <br /> <br /> The film has various alarms, and most are rather nonviolent, although in some ways grotesque. The story itself is very simple for most movies and takes a strange turn towards the end. Although the shift is not absurd, it's certainly not what you expected from the way things were going. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric, and very well done for something that seems to have been shot in video.
