As a drunken millionaire playboy, Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect for an adult man trapped in his childhood. It turned out that the film's role suited Moore so perfectly that he also trapped him as an actor. Many disappointments soon followed (including the insignificant sequel of this film), but that does not detract from the charm and appeal of this image, which is intelligently written and realized. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are forced, some parts of the movie are unstable, but the cast plays with so much flavor that it's hard to resist this movie. He has a very big heart and gives John Gielgud, Oscar winner, a devious role and amusing fun as Arthur's valet, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous relationship. Liza Minnelli (as in love with blue-collar workers) is impertinent and discreet, and Moore is impetuous, but skilful and lively; he has never left Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this document that deserves to be cherished. *** of ****
