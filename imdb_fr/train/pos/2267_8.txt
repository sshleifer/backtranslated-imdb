I did not read Kurt Vonnegut's novel or anything, but now I intend to start. This takes you from the first frame and does not let go until the final credits begin to roll. By taking you to unexpected places, the plot is always interesting. The pace is impeccable, nothing lasts too long. This allows for a perfect balance between unexpected twists and allows the viewer to process what we have seen. It is well said and well thought out. I have never watched a movie that I think I can compare particularly. It's intense and exciting, funny and sad. The acting is excellent, Nolte shines absolutely, Goodman proves once again that he does not need to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are mesmerizing. I could go on, really ... no role is dealt with less than stellar performance. The editing and cinematography are wonderful, and all the visuals are excellent, with unforgettable and amazing moments. I will go see other films made by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. There is a scene of sexuality and a lot of disturbing and disturbing content about it. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate it. it's not nice 8/10
