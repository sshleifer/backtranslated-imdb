In the outskirts of São Paulo, the dysfunctional and hypocritical bourgeois family of Teodoro (Giulio Lopes), Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and the young teenager Soninha (Sílvia Lourenço) have profound secrets. The religious Teodoro is indeed a hit-man, hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend Waldomiro (Ailton Graça). He has a lover, the very fervent woman Terezinha (Martha Meola), and he wants to regenerate by going to the country with her. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio (Ismael de Araújo), who delivers meat for the butchery of his father. Soninha is an ordinary teenager from the periphery, aged 16. She has an active sex life, smokes grass and loves heavy metal. When Júlio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood, the lives of family members change. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" is an excellent low-budget Brazilian film that describes life on the outskirts of a great Brazilian. city. The story is very real and uses the usual elements of the slums of big Brazilian cities (drug traffickers, criminals, evangelical religious fanatics, hopeless teenagers, etc.), has many points of conspiracy and a surprising end, and the characters have excellent performances, acting in a very natural way and making the story totally believable. The camera follows the characters, giving great momentum to the film. In the DVD Extras, director Roberto Moreira explains that his screenplay has no lines, only a description of the situations, and that it was only partially revealed a week before shooting began. The actors followed trainings in workshops and used a lot of improvisation, which explains their natural acting. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Contra Todos" ("Against everyone")
