I recently rented this document, after remembering having heard it on IMDb.com and being intrigued by the principle. I knew very little about these bands, but I remember hearing "Dandy Warhols" a long time ago and enjoying it. That being said, here's my perspective on the doc: <br /> <br /> One thing I found amazing in this movie is that it's not necessary to have prior knowledge of the one or other of these groups. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time to engage the audience and familiarize him with the characters of this film. I quickly became aware of the lives of both Anton and Courtney and their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think that's part of the quality of this document, and the quality of Ondi Timoner as a master documentarian. <br /> <br /> I also loved how the "story" of these bands was told. Most of what you see are groups on tour. The two groups start playing in small venues and struggle to succeed in the record industry. Throughout the film, each group strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. However, this is what makes the two groups similar, and therefore the brilliant perspective on how two groups of a feather can go in such different directions. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who loves the movie in general. You do not need to have a particular love for documentaries, nor for any of the bands. An appreciation of the music may help, but the music itself gives way to the love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
