It's one of the best films and that says a lot about the fact that it was for television. I really wish it to be on d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance. She played a rookie cop thrown into the serial killer affair to perfection. When she fell apart because he killed another child, it was amazing. She is so alone, so he joins her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as a serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into her dark world. It was worthy of an Oscar. When he talks about killing children, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They do not really do that anymore. It was a real thriller without being bloody.
