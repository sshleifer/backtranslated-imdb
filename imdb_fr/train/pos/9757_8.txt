Richard Willaims is a god of animation. He was hindered in the making of this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven movie with a very complicated story, but some amazing animation moments (like "Greedy" by Emery Hawkins). Joe Raposo's repetitive music does not help either. It was made in big screen so that the VHS does not show it in all its splendor, hopefully a DVD with mailbox one day. It's always worth watching for a dazzling animation.
