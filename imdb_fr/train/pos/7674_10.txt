I had the privilege of watching "Holly" at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who is sold for prostitution by her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) enters Holly's life and decides he wants to help him. When Holly is sold again, Patrick looks for her desperately. We follow their difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their meeting. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of millions of children sold and trafficked every day. The film describes this difficult question without crossing the line. I left trying to find out more about the problem of child trafficking and ask how can I help? This film should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes a problem that should not be ignored.
