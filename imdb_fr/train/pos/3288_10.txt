It's a fantastic fantasy film. One of my favorites, it's really cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who then directed Candyman. It started well with this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about a girl, Anna, who falls ill with glandular fever at the age of 11. She draws a house on a piece of paper from her notebook and falls into a dream in which the house is real. Every subsequent dream she has is changed by the presence of everything she adds to the picture. In her third dream, she meets a boy whom she thinks she has created and is called Mark. She befriends him and their relationship gets stronger as dreams become darker and scary. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is a wonderful actress and it is very strange that after a single film, she disappears to be in anything ever again. She really gives an excellent performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> The score of Hans Zimmer is also excellent. Like Broken Arrow, the music is ghostly and mysterious. It's a shame that the soundtrack is no longer available on CD. The DVD is available in R2 only.
