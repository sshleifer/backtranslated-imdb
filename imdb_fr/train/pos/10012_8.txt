The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he is a very interesting character in a film that is somewhat strange but very different. I can guarantee you have never seen this kind of film before. Some people may not like the slowness of the movie, but I think that's the big plus of the movie. It is certainly one of the best films of the year 2006. It presents an intriguing performance in a film with fantastic content and dramatic feel. It's not an Americanized movie. Nor is it a predictable film. You just feel it's a movie that has secrets that it's hard for you to determine what the outcome will be. It's not an excellent film that has everything, but damn it, it's a damn good movie and very original.
