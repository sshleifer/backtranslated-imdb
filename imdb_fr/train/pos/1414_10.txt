First of all, the release date is 2009 and not 2007 for this documentary feature film. It should rather be called: "Earth, 2009". Secondly, let me respond to the complaints of some critics who saw the TV series "Planet Earth" of 2006. <br /> <br /> I did not see this TV series, but I learned here that this film is full length version of this TV series of 2006. I judge any film, on its own merits, not on its source. I judge the results, by themselves, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really excellent. I reject this insignificant complaint of some critics: it is simply an expanded version of the 2006 television series "Planet Earth". So what? It does not really matter. <br /> <br /> As a film buff and having watched dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime, I was stunned and impressed by "Earth, 2009". The first film of Disney's new "DisneyNature" division, it follows in the footsteps of Walt Disney's pioneering and award-winning nature documentaries in the '50s and' 60s. <br /> Cinematography, editing, staging, music score, the sound and the narration are excellent. Some other nature documentaries have also excelled in these categories. What really sets "2009 Earth" apart is its reach. It literally covers the entire planet and the seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first screening, it was obvious that this documentary film required a considerable effort, as well as a lot of time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> Three production companies were needed to make this amazing documentary film. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly tells the stories of four species during their major migrations in a year the seasons beginning in January and ending in December, from the North Pole to the Pole South. <br /> <br /> Two new high-tech special cameras were used for this film: one camera has a motorized rotation controlled at 360 degrees by computer and the other is a HD camera set at 1,000 frames per second. This filming technique really added drama and beauty to certain scenes from "Earth, 2009", especially the cheetah hunt and the great white sharks coming out of the water to catch the sea lions and a passing aerial view. at the edge of the highest waterfall in the world. This documentary contains many shots of striking beauty. <br /> <br /> This documentary contains dramaturgy, sadness, humor and beauty. With an excellent score by the acclaimed Berliner Philharmoniker, an excellent technical and creative cinematography and a narrative by James Earl Jones, I consider "Earth, 2009" as the greatest feature-length documentary on nature ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication have really paid off here. This film should be viewed in every school in the world. I predict an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, among other awards. Really, an amazing, amazing, exhilarating and beautiful documentary film. <br /> <br /> very strongly recommended
