As we all know, the sub-genre of sexual comedies is quite crowded. To be too eccentric is not enough anymore. I have seen and heard so many jokes and disgusting actions that a sex comedy really needs other positives to seduce me these days. <br /> <br /> When I entered the 40-year-old Madonna, I basically knew what to do. expect; I saw advertisements after all; "Is it true that if you do not use it, you lose it?" What I did not expect was a heart and honest attempts to develop character. There are always the strange "offbeat" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler's films and there is still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark, but in one way or another, the movie has a love story worthy of interest and even a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person with whom I can understand myself. In the foreground, I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the film on his wall) and throughout the film we see his beautiful collection of antiques. Andy also has many video games and a working knowledge of movies and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. The most important of all; Andy is a kind person, he does not swear and he respects women so much that he does not look at them. Combine all these factors and everyone starts to think that he is a serial murderer. It's like the story of my life. <br /> <br /> The other characters each have a fun little story that goes with their slightly exaggerated personality and they all work at a certain level but not like Andy. I thought it was a bit of a distraction because Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I guess since I mentioned a defect, I could also other notable in the light. The story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances are concerned; it's pretty simple. He's been talking about Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen at the end. Although his last detour is a little different from what we expected, but you know what will happen in the end, and I assure you this is the case. These are really small spots on the film, but there are so many good ones here that I can easily ignore its some flaws. <br /> <br /> When I say "good", I mean "bad" of course. It's a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part, I think it was successful. There are so many hilarious scenes like Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy accompanies Trish's daughter in a sex education class where he ends up asking more questions than anyone else. Oh, and we must not forget the next epilation in the chest "Ooh! Como s'llama!" A small interesting note about this scene; the actor Steve Carell has actually shaved his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course, they only took one shot, but it was still very brave on his part. <br /> <br /> In fact, since we are talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that he is now up on my list of respected comedians, which is rather strange since I did not even know who he was before see this movie. I was so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye on his future roles. This man has talent is what says The Virgin, 40 years old. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had doubts about this film, but the first news was positive and I knew it was something that I was finally going to see. I'm happy to have done it too, because it's probably one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time and it's also a film worth watching. It's not just a series of bundled sexual gags, but rather a series of sexual gags intertwined with a very valuable character and a truly touching romance. Now excuse me while I'm going to vomit my guts; I can not believe I just wrote this ... <br /> <br /> My comment Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
