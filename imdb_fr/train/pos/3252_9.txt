The story of "A woman from nowhere" is rather simple and rather well adapted to the release of a western Eastwood Spaghetti: a mysterious stranger enters a city without law directed by a king and begins to film the place. Even the opening credits and the music have this spaghetti sensation: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. What is really interesting is that the stranger is a beautiful woman (!), Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) in a Harley, and that she is in a city somewhere in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this act, there is a considerable amount of shots, some good, some predictable, and some other hokey spots, but it's very entertaining. Ryoko handles his weapons with credibility and confidence and gives all the credit to thugs. It was not really an acting challenge for her, but a physical challenge, but she handled things very well. She shows her acting skills much more than Otsu in the NHK drama, "Musashi". <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend the cinema if you are a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (which I adore) and / or "Girls with guns", moviegoer and he resists repeated viewing. For me, there is something very attractive and inexplicably attractive in the movies "Girls with guns" like "The Nikita Woman" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". And having a gorgeous girl like Ryoko in this movie is simply a cherry on the cake.
