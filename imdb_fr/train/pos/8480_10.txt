Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this gigantic variety show that throws everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however, is present.) This movie gives the screen time to each person who was under contract with Warners at the time. If some artists do not seem to know certain artists, it's because they were great at the time of silence and most artists had lost their popularity. There are also some remarkable artists from the vaudeville era. You will be particularly impressed by Winnie Lightner, who plays two numbers. There is also this French star, Irene Bordoni, who sings a love song in a sexy way. One of the most striking points is undoubtedly the "Chinese Fantasy" two-band Technicolor, which has been restored for this version. It's really beautiful and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the huge final "Lady Luck" which lasts about fifteen minutes. It's really an epic from the era of early talkies. Anyone who loves old movies will love that.
