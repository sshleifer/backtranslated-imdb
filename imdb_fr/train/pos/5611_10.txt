I saw this film at a time when I was timidly thinking about moving into my own apartment and starting my own life. Maybe that's why I took it so seriously. I believed totally in the psychological degradation of the poor character in a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, misery, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I give all the credit to Polanski's artistic talent in his direction, to his play and to his inevitable script, but I fainted during the horrible final scene and I had to be revived by a cognac in the theater manager's office. . Fortunately for me, my life has not been so disastrous (until now), but I have always had great respect for an artist who can interpret such illusions and immerse himself totally in the (fictional) reality that he created. try to transmit. In simple terms, man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. This film is the sum of many cases of great comedy and casting. As some performances were done in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas, among others) and others in French (with most characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I recommend it strongly, if you are bilingual, to pass the audio from French to English and vice versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on DVD Paramount. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "apartment building trilogy", which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" still has not managed to make a good DVD transfer in region 1. Needless to say, the three films would form a magnificent box.
