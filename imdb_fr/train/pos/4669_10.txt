If there were two more charming performers than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appearing together in a more charming film in 1968, I do not know who they were. I first saw this charming little satirical jewel 25 years ago, at the age of 16, and I consider that any year during which I could not sit down to watch it again is a lost year. It's smart, offbeat, neat, melancholy, sweet, slightly subversive and quite enchanting. The romance of these two social misfits is both richly comical and terribly moving - never more than in Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to bring the right map of the game, a scene both sadly funny and a perfect portrait of loneliness heartbreaking. And this last stop on image of the worried, worried and loving face of Ustinov who asked him: "Are you okay? Has anyone ever rendered the appearance and sound of devotion so perfectly and so honestly naked? I would never want to know someone who does not like this movie.
