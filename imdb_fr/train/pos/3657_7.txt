This film is like a 1950 version of Brutti sporchi e cattivi by Ettore Scola. Less sex and less realism, but a tale full of humanism and warmth. I would not call it a neo-realistic image. It's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be classified as a comedy, even if it deals with serious subjects (a bit like Chaplin or a 1930 comedy). Typically Italian though, very emotional and hard to resist except for a cold person like stone. Sentimentalism is a disappointment, although this image is not meant to be a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's an adorable and hilarious comedy, with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
