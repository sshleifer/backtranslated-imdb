A surprisingly complex and well-designed study of the "First Serial Killer" in the USSR. At the time of perestroika, this intense play is animated by the interpretations of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> This examination of Cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and hints at some of his behaviors. while showing right others, there is a subtlety that is convincing without being openly graphic. Not for the sensitive souls, but its content is often disturbing, but it is necessary for the complete development of the main participants in this story. <br /> <br /> HBO has provided us with an excellent movie in an unusual way. . Congratulations to the director and editor of this excellent article. He is in my top 10 must see the list.
