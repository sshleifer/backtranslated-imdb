The reason I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little that it was going on until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me. Alan Dobie being a friend of mine, I heard about that. Since I had only written a rough draft, I was naturally worried when I heard it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if he would like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could see my original script because I had lost it. I was told too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name. I had no idea what they could have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I quickly asked for my name to be changed. It is a magnificent piece, drawn from a first draft hastily drafted; maybe if I had it it would not be so good. I would like to review my original script if someone knows where he is? I would also like to see the film again, I only saw it once in a small screening room in Soho.
