The debut of Miss DeCarlo has everything writers can imagine - from the Franco-Prussian War to the American Civil War, to the American Great West, San Francisco at its peak, ballet, opera, vaudeville, waste bandits. Just when you thought that the plot could not become more filthy, that's the case. It's beautiful, taken to the tongue. The character of DeCarlo (here called Anna Marie - NOT Salome, it's the role she's dancing) is loosely based on the career of the famous Lola Montez, who was the mistress of the King of Prussia and brought about a revolution when he gave him the jewels of the crown. She escaped to the American West. There is an Arizona city called "Salome where she danced", based on the historical fact that Lola Montez danced the role of Salome. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who falls under his spell are not historically accurate, I also assume that the Chinese sage with the Scottish accent is one of my favorite classics of all the camps and that DeCarlo is at Breathtaking.
