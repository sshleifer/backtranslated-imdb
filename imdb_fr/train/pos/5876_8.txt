Now, I really liked this movie, it was so funny. Both Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors. I think after watching this movie, they should do a lot more movies together in the future. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar becomes He had some trouble while dating three women at the same time, but the way he reacts when one person gets out of the door then the other was so funny to watch, he has very played well in his film and I hope John Abraham is playing his best friend, he's playing his role really well and he's so underrated that I'm glad some of his incredible works have been noticed, but he's really a good actor . . I love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and plays it well. <br /> <br /> The muse is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
