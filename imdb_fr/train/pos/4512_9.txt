I saw this film today and I must say it was much better than I expected before two hours before going to see it. Personally, I had some prejudices because of the language used, but that totally changed my idea. The film was in most cases surprisingly good with the big show of actor and actress. It was the story of a boy who had a dream and did everything to make it come true. It really touched me and as a film based on a true story, he convinced me. A new school, a psychopathic director and a young boy who makes himself known with a new teacher, a little different from others and about to fight for things even if they do not seem to work. He showed how little things can make huge changes in many things and how differences can sometimes create difficult situations. Also, I think that the selections of actors have succeeded perfectly. It was really as if you had watched the episodes as strangers when they happened. Before spoiling the film with praise, I must admit that there were things and situations that did not seem realistic, such as the one where the school director beat Frits aka. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the film. He was really beaten, but the only thing it caused him was that his nose ran down when compared to the first defeat at the start, when Frits had a few stitches. ..having to say, that if I someday find this DVD somewhere in the store, it's a sure thing, that I take it with me.
