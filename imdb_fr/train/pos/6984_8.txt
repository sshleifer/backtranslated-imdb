Battlestar Galactica reinvented, a show that has always left me guessing and made me cry on more than one occasion. A hardened science fiction fan, I like to think that I can pick the right things from the BS, and that was good. <br /> <br /> As such, when I heard about the prospect of a series of series just a few months ago, I felt nauseous. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be reused in Caprica, which would not work at all. The story of BSG, a group of gloomy and torn survivors trapped aboard rotting starships and guided by a prophetic vision and sequence of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complemented by extraordinary music and a better distribution of actors. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica describes this civilization in the cold and decadent era. The general atmosphere I received from Caprica was similar to that of Minority Report, less an excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In its true BSG form, Caprica has in its early hours of programming already tackled the issues of religious freedom, racism, morality of playing God and the nature of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The cast of Caprica is: also excellent. Each character is unique and profound, from the obsessed and distant scientist who becomes an entrepreneur to his troubled and willing daughter, each actor and actress throws himself into their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Music, which was powerfully used in BSG, also plays an important role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful percussion and sad duduks served his themes very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the show a distinct feeling from that of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is without a doubt its own living room, taken from the Battlestar franchise only. I am looking forward to the complete series.
