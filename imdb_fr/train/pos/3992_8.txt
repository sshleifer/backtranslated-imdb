While the film titles contain the word "Mother," the first thing that comes to mind is the mother's love for her children. <br /> <br /> However, the mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> The mother does not discuss the love between a mother and her child, nor how she sacrifices herself for the benefit of her child. Roger Michell, director of Notting Hill, tells us how a mother's love for a man almost half of her age hurts the people around her. <br /> <br /> Before Daniel Craig takes the role of James Bond, he plays here Darren, a man who helps to renovate the house of the mother's son and who also sleeps with his daughter. Anne Reid, who was a familiar face in television series, assumes the difficult role of the main character, May. <br /> <br /> The story begins with May facing the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, on a family visit to his son, Bobby. While she befriended Darren, a handyman who does some renovations at Bobby's, she was shocked to learn that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May was doing well after Toots' death. Fearing that Harry and Paula do not want her, May gets bored until she spends her afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was kind and friendly to May, and May soon found affection on Darren. Instead of treating him as a friend, she treated the man who was about half his age with love for a couple. Later, May found sexual pleasure at Darren, where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else. And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the collapse of a family. <br /> <br /> The mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she had never had in her life and to console herself about someone who is there for her to support. It can be said if May was buying teatime snacks for Darren to meet the sexual needs of a younger man, where it finally gave her more than she had planned. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid made a breakthrough for her. role of May, as she was previously best known for her various roles in television series. As she does not have many films in her resume, The Mother has put her on the attention of the critics. Daniel Craig, for his part, had a similar role in his film career, as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his role as James Bond in the role of buyer fails, film critics should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions during his career in cinema, and that The Mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> The mother can not be everyone's favorite, but it's certainly not your usual morning show to accompany tea and scones, accompanied by butter and jam.
