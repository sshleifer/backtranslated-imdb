"The Mother" is a strange, low-budget film about at least two uncomfortable themes that cinema does not usually explore: the denial of the mother's love for their son and daughter, and the lust and passion of the mother. third Age. <br /> <br /> The characters are awful: May is a disgusting old lady and I think it's impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her. She admits that she did not like her son and daughter. She cheated on her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals her daughter's beloved man, not to protect her from a morally unhappy guy, who does not like her, but simply because she feels excited about him. She tries to organize her life in the worst way after the loss of her husband, destroying the illusions of her daughter. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser who accepts her life as it is. His brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who wants to have his shop, a terrible deal. Darren is an amoral fool who does not like anyone, not even himself. <br /> <br /> The acting and the staging are excellent: actresses and actors have exceptional performances and the staging is very precise. I liked this movie, but I recognize that it is recommended to a very specific audience. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
