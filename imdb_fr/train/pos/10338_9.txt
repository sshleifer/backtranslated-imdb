Norman, it's you? was (it's all in the third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) suitable for an African-American family of Jewish family, when he made the transition off stage and on screen. In addition, it was one of those films originally shot on video, so the theater's impressions could not have been so good. Still, the performances of Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to say to you all is that the film is a part of the period: it reflected the attitudes of the middle in the early 70s about the discovery that you had a son or a gay girl in your family. For this reason alone, it's quite interesting, if not a bit "hollywood". Do not believe me? Check the lines on the curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the film really shines in several areas. There is a division scene when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife, who ran away with his brother (!) To Ensenada in a well inflated Pinto. The phone conversation across the border is truly memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene of the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. To my knowledge, this is the only time this routine has been filmed. And, it's a slightly cleaned version and much shorter, I'm told. Still, it's vintage lady, not to be missed. People still fly lines to Wayland; the man was really good. Enjoy the movie!
