Gene Kelly has come up with great ideas for musicals with MGM. He is here at the peak of his creative powers working with the musical unit Arthur Freed. It's hard to believe when you look at An American In Paris that the players never left back at MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of An American in Paris is the creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the sets designed by MGM, which blend perfectly into the composition. The idea for the film was born with Kelly who just wanted to make a movie with a long ballet sequence featuring the sound poem of George Gershwin, An American in Paris. It seemed good to Arthur Freed who approached Ira Gershwin who said good with him as long as they were using another Gershwin material. <br /> <br /> Gershwin got the kind of chord for Gershwin's music normally obtained by Irving Berlin. Not a note of non-Gershwin music is heard in An American in Paris. Listen to background music and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not Me Me that are not real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who could write, was an artist, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story that is certainly thin. All about an ex-GI played by Gene Kelly who, after the Second World War, never left France, has just moved into an apartment on the left bank and become a hungry artist. He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant and it still looks like redundancy. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another expatriate American played by Nina Foch, who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he returns the favor. But Kelly falls in love with a commercial played by Leslie Caron in her film debut. Caron also has a musical star, Georges Guetary, interested here. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to George Gershwin's music. An American in Paris is the first film I saw as a film in flight during my first flight. I still remember coming back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport, seeing Gene Kelly doing the rhythm. My favorite number in the movie however is Tra-La-La, which Kelly sings and dances throughout the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point, Kelly dances on the baby grand piano. <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Freed, I read a quote where he said that the American in Paris ballet sequence had to be done with the background of the French impressionists to whom he thought the public would turn rather than a realistic setting in the streets or behind the scenes. So it happened like that. Kelly had done long ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But this one has passed them all. In my opinion, this includes some of Gene Kelly's most recent films. <br /> <br /> Unexpected at the Oscars, An American in Paris was chosen best film for 1951, beating the highly favored A Streetcar Named Envie. I guess fantasy took the realism that year. Large budgets also have an advantage in this area. <br /> <br /> Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals of all time and since the studios have not all this creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.
