The plot of this enjoyable MGM musical is artificial and sometimes amusing, dealing with spying and romance, but the film is centered on melodic interludes featuring the enormous talent and athletic clapper Eleanor Powell, assisted by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra. , with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton stands out with Powell, and he and his sidekick Bert Lahr are entitled to most minutes of comedy, although Skelton is more effective when behaving like Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien's humor of the film as a companion of the dancer. Powell's technical brilliance is highlighted in an incredible scene in which Buddy Rich brings his drumming skills, and which must be watched repeatedly to allow a breath to catch up. The director Edward Buzzell uses his big cast to advance the action despite the rather incoherent scenario with which he must deal, and allows Powell's parallel impossibilities to lead the case, as appropriate.
