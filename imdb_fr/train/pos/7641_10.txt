Everyone plays pretty well his role in this "nice little film". Belushi is fortunate to live part of his life differently, but eventually realizes that what he was going to be just as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities we have, not the ones we do not have or can not have. If you can get this movie on video for about $ 10, it's an investment!
