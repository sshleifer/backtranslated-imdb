A single mother (Diane Keaton) finds herself in several jobs at minimum wage. When she is fired, she is unable to provide for her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the latter suffering from asthma. Then she goes to her friend's house and starts selling drugs. Soon, she becomes dependent on the drugs she sells. Her life collapses, especially when her children, her eldest son, discover the truth and threaten to leave her. Then she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug dealers she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This movie of life has some of the best actors I have ever seen! Diane Keaton persists a lot, and her character is crazy, but she was extremely convincing. It is much better adapted to the drama than to the comedy. However, the best performance of the film comes from Michael Seater, who plays his eldest son. He is perfect as a responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult of the family. His playing was particularly good in scenes where he confronts his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger son, is also doing a great job. <br /> <br /> A film that is worth watching, especially thanks to the role played by Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
