Something happens to Sondra Pransky when she enters the magician's box on the stage of a London theater. Sondra is unaware that the spirit of the new journalist Joe Strombel materializes by asking him to investigate the man that was told him, while traveling in another dimension, is the famous killer Tarot who has committed a deluge of crimes in London. The only problem is that the accused is, in all likelihood, a respectable man of the upper class. <br /> <br /> When Sondra narrates his experience at the great Splendini, aka Sid Waterman, the magician is surprised, but decides to go along. The two guests would be an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman is going to swim. Sondra, who pretends to be drowning, catches the attention of this handsome kid, who wants to see her more. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, both will end up in all kinds of fun situations until the mystery is revealed at the end of the movie. The real killer Tarot does not think he can deceive a resolute Sondra, which is more resourceful than it deserves. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer movie with lots of laughter that you need to get out of the heat in perfect time in a cold theater. Woody Allen has done better, and yet this sunny comedy will justify him for his past failures. In "Scoop", Mr. Allen was inspired by the romantic head piaffant his beautiful lady principal. His trademark gesturing is something this fun man will never get rid of, as it seems to be his trademark. The film contains funny liners that will go beyond the viewers' heads and may not pay attention. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "Scoop", seems to be the perfect film for Woody Allen She plays the right role while Mr. Allen makes his shtick, a perfect combination. Both are excellent in their jokes throughout the movie. Mrs. Johansson is a dazzling beauty dressed in her red swimsuit, although they have dressed her so low in most costumes she wears on screen. Hugh Jackman is considered Peter Lyman a sophisticated man of the city with the right pedigree. He makes a good appearance in the film as a man suing Ms. Johansson. Ian McShane plays the deceased journalist on Fleet Street en route to eternity. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light film on hot and humid summer, thanks to Woody Allen.
