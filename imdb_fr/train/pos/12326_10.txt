I saw this film for the first time at the Berlin Film Festival and I had never seen Hong Kong cinema before. I felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so fast and there was not a single boring moment throughout the movie. He has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is where the Taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes that highlight the extraordinary musical component of the film. This film is a must!
