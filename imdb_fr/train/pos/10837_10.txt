As an aging rocker, this film mentions Heep and Quo - my two favorite bands - but with his incredible cast (everyone) - and his fantastic script - I love this piece of creative genius. I can only recommend it more vividly - and Mick Jones has added so much (Foreigner's lead composer and lead composer and the greatest rock singer of all time - Lou Gramm) - I've watched this superb work over ten times - Bill Nighy - what a voice - Jimmy Nail - the talent oozes from all the pores - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what more can you ask for an aging rocker !! 10/10 - bright bloody. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
