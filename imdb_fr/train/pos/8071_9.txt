This film deals with the Irish rebellion of the 1920s and more particularly the life of a man after he informed a friend of the bonus to the head and consequences that resulted. Watching the movie, I felt like you could take the screenplay and with some minor updates, start again and that, unfortunately, would still suit contemporary events. But the remake would not be as good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he has earned an Oscar) and a beautiful cast that brings together most, if not all actors with brogue shoes in Hollywood at the time, most of them beginning. A very good movie to see absolutely. Highly recommended.
