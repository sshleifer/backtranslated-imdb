Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore, "Not only ... but also" saw his former collaborator "Beyond The Fringe", Peter Cook, guest on the first show, and was so well received by the BBC-2 controller, insisted. be on it every week from there. It was a team of classic comedies - Cook was tall, handsome and witty, while Dudley was small, charismatic and talented in music. The sketch that shot the house had found them in a pub, dressed in flat caps and mufflers, fantasizing about movie stars such as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It's still one of the most hilarious sketches of all time, and even when Cook keeps the corpses, he's still holding on. <br /> <br /> These characters - the idiot Pete and even bigger idiot Dud - have found their way in every episode of the show itself, seen in a different setting, such as a zoo or a Art Gallery. In the latter case, they nibbled sandwiches while discussing works of art. "This Leonardo Da Vinci cartoon ... I do not see the joke!" Says Dud. Pete points out that at the time of his initial unveiling, there were probably people in crisis. Dud almost chokes on his meal. "You really like these sandwiches!", Ad libs Cook. The two men exchanged their humor in a joyful way. The skits themselves set new standards in comedy, standards that would no longer be respected before the arrival of 'Monty Python'. <br /> <br /> The increase in the popularity of the show has also resulted in an increase in the quality of guests. Peter Sellers, for example, and John Lennon, the latter presenting a filmed element based on his poem 'Deaf Ted, Danoota & Me'. "One Leg Too Few" - Dud was named "George Spigott" (a later name in the movie "Bedazzled"), a man without legs who jumps into the office of film producer Cook to audition for the role of " Tarzan "Cook tries to drop him as best he can. "I have nothing against your right leg!", He said. "The problem is you either! <br /> <br /> Dud sometimes interviewed the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling (Cook), who, when he was not teaching crows to fly underwater, was planning to open a restaurant called 'The Frog & The Peach '. Another classic was 'The Leaping Nuns' (also used in 'Bedazzled'). But my all-time favorite must be "Superthunderstingcar", a terribly funny (and precise) parody of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's "Thunderbirds". Pete and Dud played all the roles, the latter playing the role of "Lady Penelope". "Ludwig" had Ludwig Van Beethoven as the star of a variety show in the style of "This Is Tom Jones" style. "The Immortal Bargo" was a parody documentary about the life of the reclusive movie star "Emma Bargo". In an unforgettable moment, she crossed London screaming in a loudspeaker: "I want to be alone!" <br /> <br /> Season 3 feature "Poets Cornered" with Ronnie Barker and Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton and others hanging over a tank. Everyone had to improvise the line of a poem and anyone who could not make it rhyme wound up in the ugly thing. <br /> <br /> Three seasons in total were produced, produced (at different times) by Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Unfortunately, very few editions survive. To make matters worse, the scripts were also destroyed. It is hard to believe that this situation could have occurred. <br /> <br /> The show ends in 1970. The comics then hit Broadway for the production of the famous bands "Derek & Clive", but the alcohol, which continues to multiply, separates them. . Eight years later, Cook announced that a new series was about to arrive, but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part. His ex-partner was filming in America and had no intention of working with Cook again (not at that time anyway). <br /> <br /> A sufficient number of images were collected for a BBC-2 rehearsal season in the early 90's. As expected, some articles did not stand up as well as others . Cook passed away in 1995 and, as a tribute, B. B. B. set up a program compiled from various "Parkinson" interviews and "Not only ... but also" shows. It ended pretty well with Pete and Dud who found themselves in paradise. "Hell fucking!" Exclaimed the latter. Moore died in 2002.
