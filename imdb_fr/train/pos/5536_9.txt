In fact, I really enjoyed this show. Even when I was young, I was interested in all sports, including horse racing. It was always going to be difficult to make a series based on corruption in the races and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record a shoot on this controversial topic. An episode that I remember particularly is centered on a horse that had to win a big race that seemed a little bland. A syringe was found on the floor of the stable and everyone thought she had been drugged, but nothing in the blood tests. All too late, they realized that the horse had not been doped, but that the cartilage of the knee had been removed. Like driving a car without oil and the engine down, the horse broke down with tragic consequences.
