I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and I have never forgotten it. It's beautifully filmed and the story remains captivating all the time. It is hard to believe that this was done in 1946, because the tale is still fresh today and really leaves one to think. I do not know very well the technique of the film, but the special effects of this film are fantastic, given the time of its manufacture. In addition, the acting is superb and the use of English and American actors quite amazing. I recently bought the DVD, so I can now watch whenever I want. I strongly recommend anyone interested in British postwar movies to watch this.
