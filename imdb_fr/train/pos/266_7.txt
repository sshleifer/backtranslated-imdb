This story was never among my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to take advantage of this adaptation. The motive of the mouse was effective if a little exaggerated, the bones of the story are there although the emphasis is more on the sub-plot "crime in the past". The students were pretty much the way I imagined them, but it's a pity they're not more cosmopolitan - maybe the revised 1930s framework did not allow it! I thought that very bold risks were taken with the filming; It may be because I did not re-read the book for a long time, but it seemed pretty obvious to me to know who the murderer was since his appearance on some early shooting. <br /> <br /> Humor was much more prevalent in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works but I find it quite heavy in this episode (even if I smiled at the disposable line 'Lemon sole'). All in all, a solid entry into the series is not among the best.
