Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri- directed by Hideo Gosha - with Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei (with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) among the best existing chambara films. <br /> <br /> The story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo)) working for Nakadei, who wants to become daymio. Okada, Nakadei's "cleaner" is treated like a dog - and after a while, he realizes - what he really is for Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there's so much more to this movie - every Japanese movie fan should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means heavy punishment)
