"Holes" is my favorite movie of all time! So far, I have seen this movie three times in cinemas and I can not wait to buy it on DVD next September. I read the book after watching the movie and was amazed at the similarity between the book and the movie. The director of this movie did a great job recreating the book as a movie. In addition, all the actors chosen to play the roles played their characters wonderfully, especially Max Kasch in ZigZag. Accessories for everyone who participated in the making of this film, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I highly recommend it to everyone!
