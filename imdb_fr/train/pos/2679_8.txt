A play of delirious mood, almost devoid of intrigue and if it is more inspired by the LSD than the devil, we must remember its date of creation! After a surprising opening of the SM (which is not even what it seems to be), we move to artistic vagueness, dream, imagination or memory. There are many literary and cinematographic references and it is indeed the Francoist film that Lang himself praised. Beautiful and hypnotizing, the film unfolds at a leisurely pace, but has a richness in every fold. A rare film to languish inside. Old Jess could make them when he tries. Great central performances, including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I did not even mention the places of Lisbon - ah!
