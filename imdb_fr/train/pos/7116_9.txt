No one will say that this 1945 war movie was a masterpiece. (How could a 1945 war movie be a masterpiece?) Yet it is an extremely effective account of a true story, that of Al Schmidt, blinded on Guadalcanal, interpreted by John Garfield, who spent several days wearing a headband to capture the nuances. actions of a blind person. Robert Leckie, in "Helmet for my pillow", denounces the popularity of Schmidt in favor of his foxhole companion, who was killed, writing that "the country should need living heroes". <br /> <br /> Well, I guess the country did it. And they had one here. A single fight scene in the movie, tied to the studio lot, lasts only about ten minutes and occurs at less than half of the movie instead of being saved for the climax, but it is the most scary and the most realistic there is. under fire that I remember seeing on screen, including those of "Saving Private Ryan". Men scream with fear, shout reproaches and get bored, and bleed and die without the help of color, without stereophonic, shouting, or gore. <br /> <br /> Simply from the technological point of view, the film is exceptional. It is not only that we learn the complexity of a .30-gauge, water-cooled Browning machine gun mechanism, or that it should be fired in a few bursts only, or that it should is not agitated like a fire. pipe, as in many other war movies. Technical precision adds to the captivating quality of the scene. The need to stick to short bursts is frightening when dozens of screaming enemies cross a cove at about fifty meters for the sole purpose of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined in a small weapons location. fire. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not brave, including those of the ubiquitous 1940s support, John Ridgeley, and the young and radiant Eleanor Parker. The love story is obsolete, but it works and is ultimately very moving. A striking dream sequence is included. It is not Bunuel, but for a routine film of 1945, it is distinguished by its originality and its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script or modified by someone else. He could have used the type of pruning that could have introduced a much needed ambiguity. Yet, there are strange verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer - "Why does not God strike me?" And, "In the eyes, Lee, put them in the eyes!" Depths of anxiety in a few nerdy words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a film about the 1945 war. <br /> <br /> Notes that might seem false to the contemporary viewer, but perhaps should not: the language vernacular dated that it is hard to believe that many children today could think was actually never said - "private gab," dope "," drip "," Gee "," you're idiotic ", "lady", "a swelling guy" and "feeling sorry for yourself." Consider the historical context and be nice in our judgments, at the time some of these pretty slogans were at the forefront. > <br /> Real Weaknesses: Wounded veterans meet and argue over the collective future they have The argument is over-worked by concluding, "It's not because you have a silver sheet in the head that people think you are a bad person. "There are sometimes voices off and silent prayers that are both useless and totally devoid of imagination." Please, God, let him go back to me, "and that sort of thing. /> <br /> The directors have respected the constraints of their time, so perhaps the final fade is on a photo of Independence Hall and the inspiring influences of America the Beautiful are swelling. on the back. <br /> <br /> None of this can undo the film's tremendous virtues, especially the impact of this horrific fight scene, which is not often on television. a chance, catch her.
