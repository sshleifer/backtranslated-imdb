Today's sci-fi thrillers are more like Rambo in space with monster special effects (often ridiculous such as explosions sounds in the void of space). Although tamed by current standards, the special effects of "Forbidden Planet" were quite striking for their time. Even today, they are still plausible. Still, the best part of the movie is perhaps why radio thrillers are still attractive. Much of what was happening was left to the imagination of the public. (What did Krell's creatures look like?) Because so much of the story frame was never disclosed or was disclosed until the end, tension and suspense reigned. throughout the film. The end was also very stimulating and satisfying. In my mind, it's still one of the best (if not the best) science fiction movies ever made.
