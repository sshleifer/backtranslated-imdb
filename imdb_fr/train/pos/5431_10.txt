I have seen this film many times and every time I look at it, I can not help but be entertained. Gunga Din is one of those classic movies made in Hollywood, the golden years, when the actors themselves were to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and on "monsters" created by the man to make a scene. The on-screen charisma and camaraderie demonstrated by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are sublime and very entertaining to watch. The attitude of the tongue and the cheek in which the three actors play their role works in a magnificent and flawless way. Some might consider it "corny" but I consider it a "classic" movie and the best actor. When we watch this film, we must remember that Europe was involved in a war with Germany and that the audience went to the cinema to escape the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken to a place where people were greater than life and committing goodness would always overcome evil. Gunga Din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh with and with the actors during their crazy escapades. In short, it's a classic film that does not take itself too seriously and does not want the public to want it.
