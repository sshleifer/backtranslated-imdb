Now, here's what I'm talking about. Finally, a low budget horror outlet that uses its limits to its advantage. WENDIGO, though sometimes imperfect, is a triumph of the imagination. Admittedly, she relies heavily on EVIL DEAD style camera movements for her bad mood, but she still does not have a view over 99% of that of direct video processing. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple: a family takes a vacation in a remote cabin and is threatened by a particularly disturbed hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to create suspense and add unsettling layers of goosebumps through the use of mythical Wendigo. Is it real? Is it all in the boy's imagination? Is it an externalization of the emotional state of the child? <br /> <br /> Some have criticized the fact that the film is not satisfactory because you have to decide. Do not be put off by such nonsense. A film that makes you think is not to be avoided. It's one to rejoice in.
