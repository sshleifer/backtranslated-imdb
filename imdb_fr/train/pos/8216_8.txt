*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two mediocre outings ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to have regained his momentum in "Sudden Impact", a gripping thriller that wisely plays on his strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time at the show and that reserves his energy for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> For once, the case takes Harry outside his hometown of San Francisco (where he again has problems with his superiors for his tactics "shoot first, ask more questions later "), in the hamlet of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: potential spoiler), a group of people with low life is murdered in a macabre way, one at a time, by a woman whom she raped several years ago and whose sister is in a state of catatonia since the attack. <Br/> <br /> The murderer is played by Sondra Locke and Jennifer Spencer is an interesting mix of compassion and composure. Locke's cold eyes and hoarse voice, when trying to comfort his hospitalized sister or revenge on the rapists, are very effective in portraying an injured woman whose years of suffering and anger are now beginning to bear. deadly fruits. <BR /> <br /> The rapists are an odious group, especially the leader, who wears a "psycho nutjob" almost stamped on the forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the types, despite his anatomical incapacity to participate. The flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are sufficiently nightmarish and clearly intended to encourage the audience to applaud Jennifer as she kills her attackers. <br /> <br /> Some will reject "The Sudden Impact" as a junk. manipulative revenge story. At one level, this is true, but it is a well made basket. What benefits the film is the strength of Sondra Locke's performance, which gives us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in his paintings than in his gestures or speeches. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view. <br /> <br /> You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by all means necessary, but as the mystery behind the murders becomes clear to Harry (an awareness that, wisely, is not explained by a dialogue), he is offered a choice: what to do with the killer he can sympathize with the motivations, but whose conduct it is required by law not to tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than Dirty Harry's usual fare. <br /> <br /> The other quality that redeems the film is Eastwood's focus. After all, it's a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The film is made with style and spirit, and edited to give the action scenes a great benefit. Some of the best "Harry moments" of the entire series are here, including Harry's best-known line, "Go ahead, make my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a film that has the courage of its convictions by presenting a story about a heinous crime and the brutal consequences that ensue. It's also a captivating crime novel, well done and well told. And it's certainly never boring. On these criteria, it succeeds enormously.
