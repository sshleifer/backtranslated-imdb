Broadway and actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (of Rosemary's Baby) create a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there's a Peter Falk cameo. The Beginnings of the Movie: An aging film actress (Gena Rowlands) reevaluates her life after the death of an obscure fan in a car accident while trying to get her autograph. The film has a slow pace and a dark, gloomy and scary quality. It has a cinematic look of the 60s and even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are those that every successful actress has - she gets older and she will become useless in her career. Moreover, she feels that she has lived a life devoid of all spirituality, humanity and merit. She has lived only for her career: she has no children, does not do charitable acts, etc. The gradual disintegration of his personality is the very basis of this film. She falls apart. She is in crisis. Gena Rowlands really enters the character's psyche and plays the game pretty well. She is a great actress and this 70s film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent movies of the time and / or the films about disasters or adventure thrillers. It's a film with a lot of deep emotions but a cold and cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes criticized the mainstream movies and the 70's generation actors. Either this or this movie is a 70s product that was itself cynical in many ways - Nixon's deception, Watergate, Vietnam, and so on. Although the production values ​​are not great, and this film is not known, it is a very haunting film with obsessive moods. Congratulations to the underrated director and deceased Cassavetes, who died in the late 80s.
