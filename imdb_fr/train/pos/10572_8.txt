I feel that musicals from the Warners Bros Depression era will become much more relevant over the next two years. Yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or did you live under a rock) and the times are dark. But we still have cinema as a way to escape our problems. In the 1930s, filming was very popular even at the height of economic gloom. "Footlight Parade (1933)" is one of those films that the audience attended. Although this musical directed by Lloyd Bacon does not quite capture the social problems of the time, as the "The gold seekers of 1933 (1933)", it remains a formidable showcase of talents. We have to wait until the end of the film for the three central numbers of Busby Berkely extravaganza, but hey, it's worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress. Her tapping is average, but Busby's "By A Waterfall" magic propels her, and what seems to be a hundred chorus girls, in a wonderful green. Of course, the numbers of Busby could never be interpreted on a stage (they defy the limits of the gravity, among others), and they contrast terribly with the realism of the non-musical scenes, hard and underhanded. And "Footlight" also James Cagney in one of his too rare musicals (in fact, what could not this man do?). He even manages to take over from the leading man, the mariner and the beast of the sexpot Shanghai Lil (who is really the little Ruby with the Chinese wig)! He co-starred with Joan Blondell, his adorable secretary adorer who Cagney neglects in favor of other women (up to the last reel, ie). Apparently, Blondell was the only other woman Cagney loved, except for his wife. And you can see the mutual adoration in each scene.
