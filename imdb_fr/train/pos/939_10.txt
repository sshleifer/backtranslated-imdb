Okay, there's a ton of criticism here, what can I possibly add? <br /> <br /> I will try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYTHING. The sets, the outdoor places, the costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The support cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and his nephew, played by Roger Rees. His discreet sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. His life is difficult, but he remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some said his representation was too tough. I could not disagree any more. His early exchanges, cold or hard, are not devoid of character. He is a terribly disappointed man, hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his thirst for wealth. <br /> <br /> During flashbacks, it is obvious that he is not completely gruff. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he was totally gone, his partner Marley would never have come for him. And after all, we are no longer hopeless. I think that's a huge part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge looks at his boss with Belle with his boss, you see him smile with regret as he tells Belle in the flashback that he will spend his life "with a smile on my face". Clive Donner was smart enough as a director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they are left on the floor of the editing room. <br /> <br /> And finally, his conversion is so full of joy that it makes me cry with joy every time I see it. His apologies to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so touching, are the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife is so obvious. And the line that wins me every time, "God forgive me for the time I lost." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
