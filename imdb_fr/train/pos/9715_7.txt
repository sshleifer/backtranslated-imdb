Here is the skinny, it seems that this is much older so I thought it was. But it's still cool. Cyclists are cool and the story works for the most part. I hope that some character problems will be solved by the second part and that my biggest complaint is that it seems to be a MACROSS. Not just the animation style but several character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY from MACROSS. The mechs look like MACROSS and other characters. It's really not for little kids, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So, to make a short story, I give this MACROSS cool 7 STARS.
