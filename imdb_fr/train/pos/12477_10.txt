My family and I have often seen this movie over the years. He is clean, healthy, heartbreaking and comforting. Showing the compassion between two families from two countries thousands of miles apart and the strangest coincidence, it's almost as if the hand of God had to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5-year-old Jodelle Micah Ferland who plays Desi, the little girl with a touched heart, does a magnificent job playing her part. For me, she was Priam's choice for the lead role. <br /> <br /> In total, a 10 out of 10. There are no disadvantages of this sweet human story. Children of all ages will cry, then look happily and this will bring the viewing family with smiles and good feelings.
