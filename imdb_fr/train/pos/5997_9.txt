Let me start by saying that I have never seen a film on IMDb before; However, I am myself in the video business. And coming from this perception; I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this film is what a short film should be. He has a very good story and another thing that I like a lot (an even better twist end). The opening was very well done, I loved the video chosen for her and her editing. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W but the way this movie uses the effect is effective. And with any movie that's all that matters. The sequence of the film works perfectly and editing was very well done. From the technical point of view, I work normally, everything is also very well done. There is no major technology. things to report. The only problem I have is that end credits are a little bouncy. This is probably due to a rendering problem. Let me also say that I would have preferred to see more scenes of love, but I am a guy (so you can take into account a male factor). <br /> <br /> So, overall, I rate it 9/10. It is worth watching if you are a fan of India and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry for the bad grammar or spelling.
