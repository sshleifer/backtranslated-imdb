Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been extremely hard on Alexander. Neither Marie nor Veronika have ever seemed desperate to keep Alexander, himself unintelligent but not at all intellectual, as most of us are, as difficult as anyone can admit. Alexandre gets off to perfection, takes care of everything, gives and gives what he wants. girls allow it, veronika loves sex, marie is his boss. Is there anything wrong with this? Is someone in love? really? I do not think so. Although New Wave French cinema is subject to pretense, etc., it is wonderful simply because it does not need a plot to create emotion. The facility is perfect and anyone in Alexander's position in an urban area can ask. I am looking for a boss, someone is interested?
