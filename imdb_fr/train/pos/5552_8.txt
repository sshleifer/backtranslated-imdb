I waited on July 4th to write this because. . . well . . . because I feel good doing it that day. <br /> <br /> In 1924, D.W. Griffith needed a shot, he had not had much since ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). He had been working regularly since, but his films were small in scope and did not reach audiences. He was preparing a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by members of the American Revolutionary Girls (DAR) who asked him if he could expand his ideas to further encompass the American Revolution. This film is the result. By the end of his studies, he had followed a history lesson on 14 reels and there was no trace of Patrick Henry. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the War of Independence, but Griffith began a love affair with Nathan (Neil Hamilton), patriot farmer, fell in love with the conservative aristocrat Nancy Montague ( Carol Dempster, a woman leader of Griffith for many years). The problem is that Nancy's father hates Nathan. . . not only Nathan, he hates all rebels. It does not help that, during a skirmish in the streets of Lexington, someone shakes Nathan's arm and unloads his gun and accidentally hurts Nancy's father! <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the love story is mostly embellished story of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a renegade British officer who feel they owe allegiance to anyone. With thousands of Indians forming the Six Nations on his side, he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) are inevitable. The Montague family could just as easily be Cameron's from the previous film, while Nathan could be part of the Stoneman family. The Battle of Bunker Hill sequence takes place in a very similar to a scene from THE BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army, namely the Redcoats, storming a trench filled with patriots. The only thing missing is Henry Walthall charging through No Man's Land to cram a flag into the mouth of a cannon. Surprisingly, battle scenes in America seem to lack the energy of battle scenes in BIRTH and fail to attract audiences. Something is clearly missing. This is not the scope, G.W. "Billy" Bitzer's work in the camera is pretty good. Maybe what's missing is. . . dare I say it? . . sincerity? <br /> <br /> The brutality of Captain Butler and his men is well underlined, although it occurs largely randomly or not. Do not expect the heads to be cut in close-up, as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In a scene, Captain Hare (Louis Wolhiem), second in command of Butler, escapes the eyes of a prisoner captive in captivity. We only see the beginning of the act. For the rest, the camera focuses on the face of Hare, who obviously has a good time doing it. Lionel worked occasionally with Griffith since 1912. It is said that he had contacted Griffith for work and D.W., knowing the reputation of his famous family, said: "I do not hire theater actors." To which Lionel replied: "And I am nothing like that, sir!" He is a very good and bad guy. Louis Wolhiem appeared three times with Lionel's older brother, John; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (1920) and later in THE TEMPEST (1927). As a captain. Hare, his wide-eyed, disheveled hair does not just call him a villain, but makes you think he's also crazy. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton then noticed that America was his first time on horseback and "I was afraid of dying." However, he hides his dissatisfaction very well and one can believe that he was rather equestrian at the end of the shoot. Mr. Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and asked him at one point to marry him. She refused and quickly left her company, after which her star status gradually declined. <br /> <br /> Speaking of horses, an inadvertently amusing moment that had to be reckless came during the performance of Paul Revere's race. He rode on the steps of a family to announce "Aux armes! The regulars arrive!" but as he tries to leave, the horse can not negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles by knocking his rider down! I'm amazed that Griffith did not take another shot. <br /> <br /> Is America a classic? YES! Do not wait until July 4th to see it, it's nice at any time.
