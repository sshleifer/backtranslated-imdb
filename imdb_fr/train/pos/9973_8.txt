I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up several times in the middle of a movie (as I did with the 1971 version), it's not that bad. Of course, this could be due to the fact that I was only nine when the 1971 version was published. However, I saw a lot of remakes, where I liked the original and the oldest. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and that it remained basically faithful to the original without harming the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the version of 1997 was more exciting and not so "blas". (Boring)
