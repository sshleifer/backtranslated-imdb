We are in 2009 and, in this way, this underrated gem has lost none of the power it had 31 years ago. It connects a rather large variety of characters and different stories without appearing cluttered. <br /> <br /> Clothes and music may have changed over time, but in the end it's a story that will never lose its thread-maturity. And above all, this film does its job pretty well. Of course, it's sometimes corny, but very touching too. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster's performance is striking and shows that she is truly a nature-born actress who has shown her full potential, especially in her previous films. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one.
