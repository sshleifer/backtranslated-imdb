A fabulous movie. With everything you could want in a movie. Huge battle scenes and many other actions. Suspense and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> A bit like an old swashbuckler movie. Totally entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The editing was fast and you never get bored for a second. The story looks like a classic story of problems in the royal house. The actors are beautiful and the scenery beautiful. The costumes are spectacular and the waterfall work is imaginative. The special effects are also incredible. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and wonderful to watch. It looks like a safe bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as he is usually. He is one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading woman, even with an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the film had won many awards and I can see why. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is an amazing independent movie. See for sure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. And give him a TEN + !!!
