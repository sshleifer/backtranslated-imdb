Thomas Ince has always had the knack for bringing simple and simple stories to life, with fullness and style. "The Italian" is such a film. A solid acting game, especially by George Beban, father of the silent young actor George Beban, and beautiful scenery gives him a realistic sense of possession of an early immigrant home in New York. These give this film of 1915 an unusual authenticity in this vintage. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the modern era when a man (George Beban in modern costume) reads an article about an Italian immigrant. then we go to history with George playing the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his fiancee from Italy to America, marries her and has a son with her. But times are tough and the family is struggling to survive. I wondered why the mother was not breastfeeding and avoiding the complications of the filthy formula, but, even at the beginning of Dream Factory, we advocated politically correct behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the photo is where Beban has a chance to get revenge on a crime leader who inadvertently put him in jail and who decides at the last minute not to follow his action plan. Very clean. I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Wonderful use of lighting in this film. <br /> <br /> I give "The Italian" an 8 out of 10.
