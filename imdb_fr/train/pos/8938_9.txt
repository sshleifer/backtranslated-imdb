A wonderful film version of the hit book and the play Smash Broadway about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters who have lived more than 100 years and told their story of a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll perform very well as Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also talented for Amy Hill Hearth, the New York Times' white journalist whose article on the sisters was published, etc. A lot of flashback scenes and even many news scenes are very powerful, if not as inspiring. as in the book. This is the only real disadvantage, combined with the fact that some aspects of the story are not presented clearly, such as the interracial antecedents of the sisters' mother and the reason their father was so severe. But other than that, it's a powerful film, very well done and very well executed.
