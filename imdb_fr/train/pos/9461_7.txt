Steve Carell is interpreted as a person with whom you can understand (in a way) Dan in real life, a film that I expected not to like but which ended up pleasing. Not that the film is funny, it's just that he has a big heart. We all love Steve Carell, that's not what The Office fans would expect to see from him, but you know what, I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell plays Dan Burns, a widowed father whose daughters do not really like him. A weekend, he and his daughters go to see his family. There, he goes to a bookstore and falls in love with a woman. Back home, he discovers that his brother Mitch (played by Dane Cook) goes out with this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Dan in real life, sometimes I found a little unbelievable. Is the Burns family really the kind of person doing exercises together, playing board games and doing many other things in the family? I strongly doubt it. I do not know any family like that. Does this prevent me from giving a helping hand? No. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life: *** / ****
