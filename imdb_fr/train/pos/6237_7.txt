Oh my God, from the description of the box, I thought it would be crazy like LA 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool. Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. Most, after leading this, would have chased a cliff or at least committed mass murder. I confess to only look at the first half hour (for now). By reading all the comments here, I have many things to expect. Professional critics often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor as parallel, but it is endowed with humor and fantasy and its realism is relentless. What did the Marshall Plan and the EU do? To see this in a theater with someone I know would only have resulted in a forced departure after a lot less minutes than on DVD. There is one more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the hitchhiker of hell. Whatever happens to him, it's not enough! The soulless suburb I thought existed only in Arizona, and Florida flourished in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought that sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco, and that they are here in malls in the suburbs? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said, when asked about Western civilization, "why would that be a good idea"? If the world really looked like this movie, bring that black hole, we're ready.
