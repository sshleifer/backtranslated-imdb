An inventive and suspensive exercise of claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that presents itself as a major challenge by taking place entirely in two rooms. Not quite successful, but tense, surprising and well played. Could we find the movie a bit reminiscent of SAW ?? two men trapped in the room and standing against each other ?? but unlike this film, he dares to stay true to his principle and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film. It's like watching a lab experiment. Some might find the suspense content tedious, but this review has found it exciting. The sound and images of the film are incredibly well done. This is definitely a good movie to use to show a good home video system. Just what you need for a late-night film festival, when you're in a paranoid mood. It certainly prevented me from sleeping that night.
