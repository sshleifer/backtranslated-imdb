Great storyline and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand confers on the concept of police detective "a lone wolf" a new dimension of intensity and, above all, credibility. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood policeman loses his family, friends, and pets, he is murdered usually given his minute of grief. But once the sixty seconds have elapsed, he pulls himself together, arranges his weapon and goes lightly to light his enemies, one after the other. <br /> <br /> Marc Ferrot de Montand is really devastated - by the murder of his girlfriend, of course, but also by discovering that she had another lover. In his confusion and anger, he does not seek revenge but must continue to seek the true perpetrator of a crime whose fingerprints are ubiquitous. Thus, all his actions become inevitably logical. This is the main reason why this film sticks to our seats, but it is certainly not the only one.
