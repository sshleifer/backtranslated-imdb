*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father had filmed this movie when I was 3 years old. At age 5, I had watched it more than 400 times. I just watched and watched. And I still do it today! He has a sinister story, a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf - a very moving scene - and wants to become a wolf, like him. After years of training, the lamb becomes a really REALLY harmful thing. The wolf and he go to his old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, no matter what he wants. He ends up killing the wolf, but is no longer perceived as a lamb by his old friends and can not return to his previous way of life. <br /> <br /> The art is beautiful, the songs are .. Good, all right, and dubbing is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> In the end, just watch this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
