I absolutely loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. Highly recommend :) ... I love Brazilian soaps, they deal with real events. I'm really sad that the show ended, but I'm sure I can find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see it. I loved the characters, the plot and how things finally happened to the bad guys. The only thing I would have changed is the end for Xica and her long life love. I can not wait to see him again and highly recommend him. Xica has been by far the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. I hope you all like the same thing.
