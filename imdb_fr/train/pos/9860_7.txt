This film did not have hilarious parts, mostly rather funny units, but no part was really bad either. The worst was Sid's voice. His slimy bond was too much for me. At about 5 minutes, I was sick of hearing him speak. Aside from the lazy voice, the movie was good. There have been many jokes that, if you have taken them, make the movie much better. It's a good movie for kids. There is enough to keep the adult content and enough to entertain the kids. This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
