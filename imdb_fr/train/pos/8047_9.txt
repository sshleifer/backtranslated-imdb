I stumbled upon this movie and really enjoyed it. The character of Timothy Busfield lacks redeeming qualities, and at one point Busfield and star Meloni watch the women go by ... Meloni's point of view on the parade is different from Busfield's. Janel Maloney is great ... She looks a lot like Tea Leone, but the main difference is that Janel can really ACT. Some very nice things in this movie that are well worth your attention when it is on the cable.
