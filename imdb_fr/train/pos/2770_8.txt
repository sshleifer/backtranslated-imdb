Watching David and Bathsheba is a much better way to get your Bible lesson going to Sunday school. Despite a sometimes funny and unintentionally funny scenario, the film is very entertaining. The studio system had its flaws but it spared no expense when lavish production was requested. Peck depicts King David as a vigorous but tormented poet who commits what amounts to a murder to sleep with a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey in the role of the prophet Nathan gives his usual saturnine and ferocious show. Look for silent movie star Francis X. Bushman in the role of King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
