I just want to add my value of two cents, and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been posted, but I think it's worthwhile to remind people of the perpetual genius of Damon Runyon. Without the hilarious hilarious stories of Damon Runyon in the street, this film would never have been filmed - nor most other great classics dealing with players or the likes of before 1960. Damon Runyon was a journalist and he was from Colorado. but he did see the street scene on the east coast. If you're not an avid fan of old Hollywood comedies, I'd recommend a few more films from Damon Runyon's writings; "The Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker" both feature Bob Hope, who, apart from his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a West Coast Liberal, I find his politics quite funny too!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
