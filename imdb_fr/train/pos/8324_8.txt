It's a romantic comedy in which Albert Einstein, played brilliantly by Walter Matthau, and his acolytes play match-match with his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these main roles is reinforced by a formidable cast of actors of recognized character. This movie is cute and fun ... a "feel better"! Warm recommendations.
