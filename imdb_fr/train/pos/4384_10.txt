MAJOR SPOILERS !! THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM !! <br /> <br /> Commentators have addressed the main theme of "honor" in the film, as well as too many comparisons with "Braveheart". I will highlight some points of this film about which I have not seen other comments touching: <br /> <br /> This film has a decidedly different vision of abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the bad guy's girlfriend (Roth), and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she says it's too late for that. The shame of her situation ("I must have a bastard bastard.") Leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to become pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after being raped by Roth's character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). Late in the movie, as Rob leaves for a final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a hint of abortion. Rob responds in a noble tone, "it's not the child's fault," then declares what he thinks the name should be, girl or boy. I find that this position "pro-life" on the part of the hero is very little Hollywood. Rob goes from the darkness of the house to the outside light to make this comment - not a fortuitous symbolism. <br /> <br /> Another theme related to Roth's character is a bastard, someone who obviously does not know who his father was, and has few kind words for his mother, although he carries a picture from her in a holster hung around her neck. Is it a coincidence that Roth (devoid of family stability) is the ambulant definition of the psychopath, while Rob is the strong figure of husband / father and, of course, the hero. In the last sword fight between Rob and the wicked (Roth), the first cut him deeply in the chest - the left side of the chest, above the heart. His employer and character pseudo-father (character John Hurt) hold the photo of the mother in his hand and fix it before grabbing the neck of the deceased Roth. <br /> <br /> What I found interesting is also direction of the scene of the rape, which was not quite graphic but was not out of the camera either and implicit . I found this surprising in her somewhat factual description, Mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and subsequent post-traumatic stress (as we now call it). My argument being that rape was neither sensational nor simply involved, which I find an interesting way to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the final fight scene, I have to correct a previous comment: the Roth weapon chosen was a rapier (or maybe a short sword), the weapon chosen by Rob was a Claymore. Someone was really doing his homework on this whole scene. Roth would have the advantage in such a situation, but of course, the Claymore is a distinctly Scottish weapon. What is even more striking for me (as a shooter and someone who has read a bit about it) is that this final saber fight is one of the most convincing of all the films: the actors actually seem to want to kill themselves - - It's not the usual knives to the opponent's blade that we see in most movie fights (including the opening movie fight). Even more faithful to the story, Roth has been seen several times using the spear as a thrust weapon, which is his goal! (The rapiers were sharp, but consisted mainly of a thrust weapon whose sharp edges were mainly used to ward off an opponent's thrust.) Rob uses the Claymore in slashes, as his design intent. The fight is unfolding as I expected - Roth actually wins. Although Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolic) and hitting him dead with a powerful gash. <br /> <br /> It is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a sword fight at the movies. <I will also note that for some reason, I remember 1995 (the year of liberation) distinctly as a period of mistrust of the US government. Hollywood was obviously listening with the release of "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart," and I think anti-government propensities are the reason why both movies are so compared. <br /> <br /> I think the different perspective offered by this film is refreshing for ferocious moviegoers, tired of the same old and less hidden message of Hollywood.
