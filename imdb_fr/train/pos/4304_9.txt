I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7 years old. and at the time it shocked me. I had already seen a violent film, but I have never seen a film with the consequences and the reality of the violence. This film not only shows that, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this film did and what failed in the crash was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how bad racism was (and that Crash actually had an integrated anti-Asian bias) and attack a morally superior position. Grand Canyon approached things from a point of view so brutal and real that it ended up on a higher ground than an accident. Especially when we compare the ends. The end of the crash is this small so-called neat end that binds everything. While Grand Canyon just ends on a silent note, where you know nothing will change much in the character's life, but it's because life goes on too, there's no proper ending. It does not matter how good you are. There is no end of chapter to start another.
