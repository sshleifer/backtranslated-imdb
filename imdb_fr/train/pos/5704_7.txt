To be fair, I was expecting car chases in this movie. There was really only one, but other than that, Freeway was an excellent movie that I'm happy to own on DVD. The only big names in the cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as a radio psychiatrist and Billy Drago, the villain of B-Movie, in the role of super-killer citing Revelation, killing Freeway. But the rest of the distribution usually gives good performance. I particularly appreciated the way Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a little courage. She could have been a helpless victim, but she is completely rounded as she searches for Draco with the help of bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm afraid, looks more like wood, but then again, the character he embodies, Frank, is not very well stuffed, except for a past story . Sunny is given by his former commanding officer. The tone of the threat is kept beautifully throughout the film and the atmosphere of Los Angeles's lonely highway at night with the killer roaming in its sinister gray sedan is a great way to create tension, and the music used to emphasize the film is suitably composed. I do not know why there are people who hate this movie then. Different traits for different people, I guess. But I really enjoyed "Freeway" and can highly recommend it.
