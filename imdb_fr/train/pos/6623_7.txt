First of all, this film is extremely beautiful. Someone who works on CG 3D films as a composer / lighter, the visuals blew me away. Every second, I was stunned by what was on the screen. As for the story, well, that's fine. It's not going to ignite the world, but if you like your futuristic stories of Blade Runner (and who does not like it?), Everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> I must say that I felt that the dubbing was particularly bland and hurt the film as a whole. I saw it in English cinema, but I hope there is a French version floating somewhere. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth it.
