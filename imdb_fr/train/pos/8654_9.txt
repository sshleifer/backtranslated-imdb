It's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this gem. All the people I visited came back with the same reaction: IT'S A GREAT FILM !! !! <br /> <br /> I've never really cared about Brad Pitt (although his twists and turns in 12 monkeys are improving) but his performance in this movie as psychopath is disconcerting, dark and just for the purpose. <br /> <br /> All the others in the film give excellent performances and the slow and deliberate rate of the film improves the procedure considerably. the fear of characters continues to grow as they realize what really happened. <br /> <br /> the only thing that prevents this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what preceded it, the end is a little too long and exaggerated. but that's the only flaw I can find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, try to get the ungraded director's cut with mailbox for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> note: 9
