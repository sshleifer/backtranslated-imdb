It's a very good film. Do you want to know the real reasons why so many people here are hitting this movie? I am going to tell you. In this movie, you have a black criminal who surpasses a white teacher. A black cop who tells the white professor that he is wrong to defend the black criminal and that the black cop turns out to be fair. make the white professor stupid. It always comes back to the race. It's an excellent movie. Do not pay attention to the racist. If you can deduce that there are characters played by blacks in this movie that surpass the white characters, then you should not have any problem to enjoy this movie. I recommended everyone to go see this movie.
