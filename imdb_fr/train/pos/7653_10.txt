Shot in the Heart is wonderful. This brilliantly illustrates the fate of Gary Gimore, a convicted murder that required death. Shot in the Heart shows the ordeal that Gilmore's family, torn apart by hatred, went through. This film is an incredible psychological study, and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10
