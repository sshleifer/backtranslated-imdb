"An album of songs so old that everyone thinks they are new." This film presents an elusive combination of rhythm and atmosphere that distinguishes certain films from the first moments. And why not? Lady Judith Dench is a talented widow who plays the saxophone with a street musician to help her compose the songs, Olympia Dukakis as the merry widow living in a Scottish castle for her many weddings, to Ian Holm as drummer who loved all members of a women's swing group (more or less) of the second world war. But wait, there is more. Add to that Leslie Caron on bass, and the incomparable Clio Laine in the main voice, and the Blonde Bombshells are the most popular band in England since the Beatles. Okay, not really, but this movie is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spends the whole movie trying to reunite the Blonde Bombshells to play in her granddaughter's school dance. And before you roll your eyes, imagine how difficult and brave it would be for a group of sex-dating women to come on stage in front of the Britney Spears generation after an act called "Open Wound". <br /> <br /> When the actresses finished their career at the age of 30, the second album of most bands is a compilation of the greatest hits, and the music of more than a month has almost no chance of airing, it's good to see real talent, real music and really a good movie just where does the BBC come from. <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I know I'll watch it again and I'll enjoy it more each time.
