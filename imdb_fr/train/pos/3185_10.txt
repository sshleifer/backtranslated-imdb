touching story ........ voted ten against all averages for my age and sex ... not so much as comedy (compared to a film that I almost wet) although quite funny. It's not a fan of musicals, so probably a little too much for me, but they give you time to have a drink or a soda without forgetting anything important. maybe a fifties version of when Harry met Sally? Ahab no, not really, but if it's part of your top ten as if it were mine, you'll like this movie. really, it just leaves you with a warm blur feeling, reminding you what romance could and should be, something for which to shoot. my resume describes it best in very few words ..... quite charming
