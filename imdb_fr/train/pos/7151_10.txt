I read Holes in grade 5 so when I heard they were making a movie, I was ecstatic! Of course, being very busy, I did not have the chance to see the movie in theaters. Holes was just outside the city but, alas, we were too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen him and none of them had invited me! They all said it was good, but I read some great books that made shitty movies, so I was worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the perfect opportunity to see that happened. It was the week and my parents were cruising and I was allowed to babysit. My sister, who is 9 years old, I looked at her and I loved her! I then brought it to other people in the house where I was babysitting and their 9- and 4-year-olds liked it too. Even my parents loved it and are real movie critics. Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who understands family morale and who loves hilarious actors! This film should be on your list of "Top 5 to see" !!!!
