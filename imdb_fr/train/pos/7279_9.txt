My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 years old (I always liked horror movies) and even then, I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is great and the story original and entertaining. I particularly like the scenes where the camper is attacked in the desert. The stones are actually convincing for a low-budget movie. The acting is above average for this kind of movies and the music is strange. It's really a jewel under the odds. I recommend it to anyone who loves these strange movies of the late '70s and early' 80s such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Poor Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Hospital Massacre" and "Return of the Aliens, the Deadly ". Fray. "Definitely a classic !!
