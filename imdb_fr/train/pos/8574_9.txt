Fun for adults and children alike, this film works on many levels: everything from car collisions and cakes to very good (but subtle) jokes for adults. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is at her best evil like Cruella ("Call Me Ella") from City. <br /> <br /> After three years in Dr. Pavlov's behavior modification clinic, is she cured of her desire for fur? even the puppy skin fur she had so intensely desired. All her fur coats were even placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle where she lives. <br /> <br /> But it would not be a "Dalmatian" movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know something will change his behavior change. And now, she needs one more pup (by 102 Dalmatians) to carry out her damaging project this time around. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is immediately attractive as a hero of the movie that runs the "Second Chance" dog shelter. Although he was in `Titanic 'and last year's televised version (under the name Pip) of' Great Expectations', I did not recognize him; Well, he was the fifth Lowe officer in Titanic and I did not see the high expectations, so I'm not very surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a charming tour as a Cruella furliner. It prances and adopts the most extravagant and scandalous fur attitudes you have ever seen ?? and do it well. His homage to "the wicked witch of the West" is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is superb, is not that the bad guy from Cruella? he was also ?? Alonzo, the "Cruella butler", in "101 Dalmatians" and you can also recognize him among all the "Black Adder" Brit-Coms. He plays his usual chaotic character, good heart, a little weak-minded. <br /> <br /> The Oscars are generally attributed to costumes for all the costumes of a film. It's a shame because the clothes worn by Glenn Close are incredible ?? it's incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she's out of the behavior modification clinic) and worthy of such an extravagant character. His clothes alone deserve at least one Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation has a special place in my heart ?? but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can not be done. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmatians" is even better than the 1996 film version of "101 Dalmatians". There is a lot to love here: gags in sight, dialogues and costumes in the casting - it's a good movie for the whole family.
