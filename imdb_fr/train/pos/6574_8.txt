This could be difficult for some people, being used to Hollywood production styles. The staging is devoid of inspiration, it is apparently simply a shoot of the staging and the audio quality is bad here and there (the rustling of people's clothes sometimes rivals their voices, etc. .). <br /> <br /> My friends and I started to watch without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost discouraged us. It seemed very understated and cheesy. Then we raised the tone of the content and started to really enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun, despite some mistakes. Give it a chance if you enjoy an excellent dialogue. Helena Bonham Carter is of course adorable.
