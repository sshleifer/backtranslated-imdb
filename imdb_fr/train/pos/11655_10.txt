There are far too many topics to avoid in movies and eating disorders is one of them. This film shows it as it is. Viewers can not enjoy it, it is presented with a truth that makes it even more powerful. I only saw it once and it was a few years ago, but I can always remember everything and how I felt. It is a very powerful film and a good support for anyone suffering from an eating disorder to give them the will to stop. That's what movies should be - they should be there to help people and not to show off things that are wrong.
