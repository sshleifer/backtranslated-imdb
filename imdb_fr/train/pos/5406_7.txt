The 4th Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Do not dare say that Pokemon is afraid! I do not like when people say that ... I love Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy it, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, say the Pok√©mon is excellent and should appeal to all ages. And also, why do Pokemon hackers give bad ratings to all Pokemon movies or most of them? I do not understand ... They should not do this ... There is absolutely no reason for people to vote without proving that Pokemon is bad, except that: 1) Pokemon is for small children only. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not love Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
