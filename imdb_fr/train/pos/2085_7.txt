Sidney Franklin's "The Good Earth" achieved classic status with a timeless story and superb acting, including Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of O-Lan. Rainers' performance is so complete that it is almost unrecognizable. Having very little dialogue throughout the film (and it is long), Rainer relies instead on the language of the face and body. She looks and acts in Chinese so that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily take it for such and such. <br /> <br /> The film remains relevant today, as it explores the history of rags with the richness and the universal themes that go with it. . When Lung and his wife, O-Lan, end up enjoying financial success after years of famine and poverty, they discover a life rich in property, but meaningless. Only when they return to earth after fighting a swarm of grasshoppers (the special effects used to create them are always incredible and beautiful to look at) they find their fulfillment. A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. Money is worthless without friends and family, a point that the film tells perfectly in its last 10 minutes with a rewarding conclusion on the emotional level.
