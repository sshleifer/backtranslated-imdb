I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it a lot. it gives an insight into how an independent film is produced and the amount of work it entails when you have a small budget and you need an actor / actress name to get people to come, to all those who want to come and see him and give him an exhibition. Bobby Myeres, played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder, is a great combination. Finding the eccentric Miachel Bates, a "NAME" actor played by Alan Bates was a perfect casting decision for the film and for the film. My favorite member of the cast was Sandy Ryan, played by the magnificent and underrated Debra Kara Unger with her own special performance in the film included in the film. If you like to think while watching a comedy, this one is for you. Low budget meets low budget with high laugh content
