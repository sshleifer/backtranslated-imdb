I meant that in a good way, believe me. True to life, it is not. The whole Oirish is getting a little thicker, but you're enjoying the cast here: Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. Everything is fine. I also liked to see Mike Mazurki - of course he played a boxer, what else? A typical quarantine scrolls one after the other with familiar faces and rhythmic scenes. <br /> <br /> Flynn goes very well as a gentleman Jim, you never go beyond a look in 1, but it's good, it's a cartoon and made to please, that's all. The boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Bond's vaudeville was a riot, and you wanted to see all these bicycles bicycles scrolling several times. <br /> <br /> Really crazy, Flynn was on a roll at that time and we can see why the public loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
