Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I came across this version of the film in the late 90s, I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a bit long, but it is worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing like Rochester. I was glad they chose a normal-looking (Zelah Clark) actress (Jane) and not a glamorous person. I love the decor and the location. For all the real fans of Jane Eyre, here is the version to watch !!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I watched my VHS copy almost to crack, so I was happy to find it on DVD.
