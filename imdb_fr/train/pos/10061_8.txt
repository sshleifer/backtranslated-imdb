One of the most comforting foreign films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The girl is an incredible talent. Stellar performances on his part (Doggie), the old man (the king of masks) and Liang (the living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially women, is worrying. <Br/> <br /> I loved the music. The original Chinese dialogue accentuates the emotional intensity of representations and history. <br /> <br /> This is an essential family film, certainly, but not suitable for very young children. Would have noted the release of the DVD even higher if the soundtrack had been better transferred to the DVD and if the transfer had included the widescreen version.
