Although they are not as famous as some of their collaborations (such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a little dandy horror movie, even though casting choices have been a little strange. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a strange scientist who lives in the Carpathian Mountains - near the birthplace of Dracula's character. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - whose nationality has never been discussed, although his name certainly sounds in French. I really think it would have been logical to have both roles reversed, because the role of the Carpathians seems to be tailor-made for Lugosi - especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual twist, the two still did a great job. Karloff was certainly the main role, but Lugosi did well in his relatively normal role - which he did not often play in movies !! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah, as other scientists (especially Benet) think that his theories are bizarre and absurd. However, over the course of the film, Rukh was right and Benet is particularly generous in his new praise for Rukh. But, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has the side effect of turning it into a crazy killing machine (do not hate it when it happens?). Even though it might have been just a mad scientist, the plot was well constructed, the well-developed characters and the crazy Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> This Everyone will enjoy movies, except those who hate old horror movies. You can really say that Universal Pictures has done everything and made a bigger budget movie instead of the cheap fast films that Lugosi and Karloff have sadly gravitated afterwards. Good product.
