I'm surprised how many people attribute to this movement less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about growing up There's a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there are good reasons for so many critics to like this movie. <br /> <br /> The reason is that they understand the film. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the low scores attributed by some people. <br /> <br /> I wish I could write a short summary of A film but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I really have nothing else to say.
