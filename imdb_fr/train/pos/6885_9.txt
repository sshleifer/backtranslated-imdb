It came by surprise. . . The impact and resolution of this film have had on my automatic way to be responsive to people and situations. The most vivid was the agitation of emotional anger. This is very similar to how a spoiled child would react if he did not succeed. . a tantrum if you want. To think that I was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous joke of all. What did it cost me? Soooo a lot of love. . Too many blessings. Now, I am aware of the incredible humility I feel and the permanent attitude of gratitude for life. . .for what is happening in the present moment, without my foolish expectations that life is a particular way, the way I think life or people "should" be. This film contributed to the freedom I now feel to connect with others, without limits or expectations. . .and to connect with true love. . without fear of losing. . Just to love first and accept what love is given.
