It is interesting to see how the train of research can flow. I started to watch an article about "The Gates" of Cristo in Central Park. The article stated that the Maysles had been Cristo's filmographers for years. Hmmm ... Then I had to watch their work. I believe that one of them is dead, but the other still films Cristo and Jean Claude in their creation stages. Gray Gardens seemed very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is the perfect place to search for the dark or offbeat and, of course, they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women of the past, and what glorious past it was. Edith had been well off, born Bouvier, well married, had many wonderful relationships and had become a singer at the age of forty. His daughter Edie had been a beginner, model and had a lot of cabbage. She never got married and at one point in her thirties, she came home to recover. She seems to have some nervous disorder. To worry too much about things. It's only a shadow of the world they live in, because Jackie O. came and set up the place so that her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. It is a mansion of 28 rooms that is worn and worn. But in the movie you will notice some fresh paint on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings, you will find that the situation is really dirty. The Edie outfits comes with a very clever and creative. The viewer feels that Edith likes to go nude, but that's not the case in the movie. Edith was really beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty when she sings "Tea for Two". Edie was also a beauty in her day and very attractive at 56 years old. It was a good movie, but not for everyone. When the cat urinates Edith's portrait, she declares "at least someone does what he wants"!
