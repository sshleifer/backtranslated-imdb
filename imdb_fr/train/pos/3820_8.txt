This is a story about Shin-ae, who moves to Milyang of Seoul with her young son Jun to start again after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here and she opens a piano school, but also has the ambition to own land with the insurance money she received from death. If that were the case, the film would probably have been like a Hollywood movie, with its love for a guy from the city and his love of life with his son in their new home. But it's not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, apparently because we know that she has money from the colony. The process of mourning, attempts to move forward, attempts to rid her conscience of guilt are all done admirably, and the main actress is superb. The only warning, and it must be said, is that it is a depressing film. You must know that you are going there. You want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find some happiness. Again, it's not Hollywood, it's Korea and in Korean cinema, especially the theater, they do not shoot. Life is what happens to you. Good acting, but sometimes a movie difficult to watch, because of events. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do this.
