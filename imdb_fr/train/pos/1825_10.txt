I saw this film when I was young and I remembered it as one of the first films I really liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So in my last years, I decided to look again and see if it was just nostalgia or if there was really something in this movie. To my surprise, the film held all my expectations. It's a good movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, beautiful songs (not great, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and, in short, a great use of my time. I was surprised because the last films of my childhood that I revisited did not even meet my minimum requirements of a decent film and yet, this film, which I saw for the first time in second year, made me cry today, just as it made me cry then. . Maybe it's because my dog ​​died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel and that's why filmmakers make movies (that and the money , of course). Yes, there are continuity problems. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So do not be fooled by cynical people who are always looking for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10, not because it's perfect. It just becomes 10 because it made me feel.
