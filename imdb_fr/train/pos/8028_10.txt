This is the best movie I have ever seen !!! Thomas Beckett and Richard Miller - two men who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and violence, one shot - one killed !!? You must kill, if you have doubts about something, YOU MUST SURVIVE !! <br /> <br /> P.P.- I apologize for my worst / worst / english !!!
