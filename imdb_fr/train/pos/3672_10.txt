A fake documentary about two Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first film in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is the comic story of their struggle to get everything together, despite a number of contradictions. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works like a film in a way very similar to That This Spinal Tap (1984) so ​​well. Namely, even if it is exaggerated in some ways, it is very close to the truth and the truth is facts "behind the scenes" that are very different from the public reality of the industry. It's not easy to make a film and it must have been particularly difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Films involve dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have incompatible desires, motivations, and personalities. Financial and screen talent are particularly crucial, because if the film were to turn or become unstable at any time, this could jeopardize the whole affair, which would require new shots or abandonment total of the film. <BR /> <br /> So it's no surprise that North Hollywood is focusing on this type of relationship. The result is an excellent film both hilarious and tragic. The script is flawless and the performance is top notch. It is a must for any aspiring filmmaker and for anyone who is serious about filmmaking. It should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a minimum of intelligence and a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 from me.
