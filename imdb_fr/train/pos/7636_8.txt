I've been seeing this for a few years, but remember it and want to see it again. It has become for me a "therapy" with personal experience. <br /> <br /> A 35-year-old man laments a high school ball game in which he "missed the ball". his team lost. He thinks 20 years later, "if only I hit this ball" and how his life would be better. Then he has the chance to find out .... and gets a little more than he had planned. <br /> <br /> It reminds me so much of when I was in high school, I already tried twice for our drill / dance team and did not do it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were there, you were "all that". I only tried during my last two years of HS and after the second time, I took it very seriously. I had very badly touched my leg just before the trials and I wore tights to cover the bruise, which prevented me from surviving. It was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Through the years, even now, sometimes, I thought to myself: "If only I had not hit my leg, I would never have worn that stupid pantyhose . " Now, I do not sit down and I do not think my life would have been better or even different if I had done it, but seeing this film made me realize that we never really know how much things can to be different by changing a little thing in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to such an extent that I would not have met my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who wants it. they could change. Be careful what you want !!!
