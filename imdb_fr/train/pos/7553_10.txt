When I saw this film a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. Her greatness caught my attention so much that I concentrated her throughout her life. I would recommend seeing it not only to anime fans, but to all those who love beautiful movies (or those who like really weird stuff). The style of the art is beautiful, the sound is perfect and the symbolism inside is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text in the film, but I think that its way of proceeding is complementary to the strange style of the film. The self-described description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not do justice to this film with absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more works from those who realized this and see them.
