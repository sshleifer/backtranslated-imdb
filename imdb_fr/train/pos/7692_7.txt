First, I'll give my rating for the series as a whole. ******* 7 out of 10 stars. I won three for the descent that this series suffered after the departure of John Amos. Do not get me wrong, there were difficult episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left for a season and came back. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a really great sit-com (with dramatic nuances) was created CBS. It was a television premiere, a show about an African-American family living in the Chicago Projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of "Maude," he once again hit the mark agreement with the viewers. <br /> <br /> Since this show, I have not seen a situation comedy directly talking about the difficulties of families from disadvantaged neighborhoods. (There was Fox's "South Central" in 1994 but it was not renewed.) <br /> <br /> John Amos, James Evans Sr., was the ultimate father figure of this family and acted like everything else father should keep him his family and his children have taken the wrong paths in life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a wonderful, meaningless mother who was on the same wavelength as her husband when it came to raising their children. . <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael, a young man very bright for his age but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is identical to that of the founder of the series, Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson in "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans died on 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a 16 or 17 year old girl who faces the dangers of being a young woman on the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical young man who does not take life seriously enough. <br /> <br /> In summary, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, with the exception of Penny. History of Gordon / Janet Jackson. <br /> <br /> After the disappearance of James Evans's character, the show lost its stability and the viewers are gone. Esther Rolle left for a whole year, not wanting to play the second violin of JJ's intelligent aleck, "Dyno-mite's"! <br /> <br /> She came back the following season after getting the guarantee that the writer would fix everything. Florida's neighbor, Wilona Woods, was a divorced woman who eventually adopted a mistreated little girl, Penny Gordon (played by Janet Jackson, then 10). Penny's abusive mother was played by Totie Fields, Kim Fields' mother. <br /> <br /> In August 1979, the show stops, all abandoning projects for a better life. JJ the artist had sold an idea to a comics company, Michael went to live on campus, at the university. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma & her husband, football player Keith + Florida, have all moved into the same building in downtown Chicago. It was not the most realistic end, but at that time it was irrelevant.
