Starlift is an interesting and interesting reminder of the all-star musical images that all the studios broadcast during the Second World War. When you have such stars as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, Randolph Scott, etc., in the film and with such personalities as the Gershwin brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, who provide the music. it's an easy film to take. And the plot does not even stand in the way. <br /> <br /> The plot involves two Air Force men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, who are trying to meet Warner Brothers star Janice Rule, using the gadget that they both come from Youngstown, Ohio, and Hagerthy's father was Rule's dentist, and half of the city's. The scheme works too well because Louella Parsons soon places them in his column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. She'd probably liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner to serve her better than the other studio conductors, because she also used the studio to publicize her Hollywood Hotel radio program at the time. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot She also spoke about the real-life efforts of Ruth Roman, who herself sought to get her studio together and others to do shows in the basics of the Air Force for the military going to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and play in a show at Travis Air Force Base where much of this film was shot. <br /> <br /> A specialty number was shot for the talents of Phil Harris who sings / tells a Look Out Stranger ballad, I am a Texas Ranger assisted and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yes, Cooper seemed to make fun of his image. <br /> <br /> It's the oldest clich√© when you say they do not do it anymore, but they do not really do it. because you do not have a studio system that has all that talent under contract. It's one thing about the disappearance of the old studio system that we can cry.
