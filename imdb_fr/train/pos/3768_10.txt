I realize that many people hate this movie, but I must admit that it is one of my favorites. I like him better than his predecessor and happy to love him better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think that people never give any credit to the story, much like Back to the future, time Travel is hard to write and, in this movie, they include time travel and a spiritual journey. <br /> <br /> I also have the feeling that Keanu and Alex were playing the best performances of this movie, they looked colder, behaved colder, and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> The scenography of this film is also great, the decors are quite detailed and sometimes huge and it is hard to believe that these sets were made for a film on two buds teenager who know to it is not the genius of all the frankness that makes these two idiots characters larger than life who are responsible for all the utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> The costume design was great too. Bill and Ted really look cool in Bogus Journey, where, as in Excellent Adventure, they look a bit like they would say, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music of this film is extraordinary, especially the score. There are so many things I could say about this movie, because I love it. But it's one of those movies I've seen growing and every time I liked to love it more, so I can understand why people hate or just think it's fictional about Excellent adventure (which I also love elsewhere). <br /> <br /> Get off with your bad self !!!!
