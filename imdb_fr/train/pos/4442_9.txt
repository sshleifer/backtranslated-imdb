The Ogre is a film made for television in Italy and should not be a continuation of Demons since Lamberto Bava even mentions it in the interview of the DVD Sheirk Show, but it was called Demons III to be part of the Demons series. The music in Demons and Demons 2 was 80s rock music, while the music was scary and the first two were horrible and horrible. Demons III: The Ogre is an architectural horror. like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is scary and it gives a tone to the castle in which the film unfolds. The Ogre is another reason why I like the movie. There are two other films listed in Demons III: Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demons III: The Ogre is a good movie, as long as you do not compare it to Demons and Demons 2.
