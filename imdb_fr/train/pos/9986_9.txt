Perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the film without knowing the story in advance did not bother him. The characters have so many complexities that everyone can understand them in their own way. The advantage of this adaptation lies in the fact that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions on the lives of the characters, rather than being spoon-fed. You can love them or not like them, while feeling the emotional impact of the film. The magnificent performances of Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I highly recommend it.
