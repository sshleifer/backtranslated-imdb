It's the best piece of film ever created. It's a masterpiece that made me tear my eye. I will never forget my experience by watching her. I do not understand why people do not think like me. The dinosaur has a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator. This should be published on Superbit DVD so that I can enjoy it as it was supposed to be during production and filming. Whoppi Goldberg really turns in the performance of his life as a hard and gritty cop who is against his will associated with a dinosaur with the ball as a partner while the hi-jinx follows to say the least. By the way, I say the exact opposite of what is true, this film is hogwash.
