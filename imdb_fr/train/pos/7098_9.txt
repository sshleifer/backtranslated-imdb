"Twelve Monkeys" has all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An exceptional scenario, a steady pace, clever and sometimes ironic dialogues. Plus, he had a good nose on the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film where Bruce Willis moves away from the kind of character he had played in his previous films. Here, a jaded and hopeless character, nicknamed prisoner, succeeded a fearless and invincible hero (as was the case in "Die hard"). No matter how he tries, he is prisoner of time. The film also contains a very exciting ending. He has a real dramatic power. But this great film is also a reflection on the man, the dangers he dreads (especially those that could cause the end of the world and here, they are viruses that can create diseases). No matter how long it takes, "twelve monkeys" will be valued at its true value: one of the masterpieces of the nineties.
