Note to previous comment: This film is an "adaptation of the Iliad by science fiction", according to the screenwriter. So, whether the references are painful or not, no excuse is the basis of the film. They admit that they flew ... although adapted is the term P.C. <br /> <br /> Excellent film but too short. Probably not released as well as the author, the director or the studio wanted it, but really damn fun. The fact that the studio itself imploded during the manufacturing process only adds to its heritage. <br /> <br /> A big budget remake would not be as fun and probably would not make the scenario more equitable. But it's fun to dream of the potential there. A DVD version with some meager extras is apparently available, but I do not think it could be read on NTSC players. I am not an expert so I always try to understand that. For now, I live with the VHS incarnation.
