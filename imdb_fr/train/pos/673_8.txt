Through the great divide we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about what was explained by the ancient tribal elders. In any case, there are many risks of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they warn, it is the "end of time". In this movie entitled "The Last Wave", an aboriginal person is murdered for no apparent reason. When the leaders are arrested, they remain silent, the less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the role of the defense attorney to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images of his own childhood and warned by the modern signs given him by a friendly Native named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton defends the offense as a tribal law and is therefore not subject to the justice. The film is full of dark and disturbing images of apocalyptic catastrophes in the final world and warns of a future tsunami and disaster on an island. Black drama and deep rituals are what make this movie look scary and therefore not intended for the shy, in fact, the simplest and haunting appearances can last for years in the nightmares of innocent moviegoers. Good silent drama. ****
