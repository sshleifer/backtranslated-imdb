Skip McCoy is a loser three times winner, unable to suppress his instinct in the street, he takes the bag of Candy in a subway train. What he does not realize is that Candy has a very secret microfilm, a microfilm that is of interest to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller has created an exceptional drama taking place in the underworld of New York. City. Communist spies and shadow government members mingle to make Pickup On South Street a fascinating show from first to last minute. Based on a Dwight Taylor story entitled Blaze Of Glory, Fuller enthused this adaptation with a well-defined political agenda, which, at the time, had already seemed out of date, but focusing solely on his anti-communist leanings is a great service. /> <br /> If you dig a little deeper and you find characters as intriguing as those that Fuller directed, the main protagonist for one of them is the hero of the play, a scammer and a a superficial human being, his exploits are not born of love for his country, they are born of his pure obstinate line. It's quite a feat that Fuller created one of the best anti-heroes of the '50s, and I'm sure he was very grateful for Richard Widmark's performance as McCoy, his smiling, cold heart, his interaction with the wonderful Jean Peters as Candy is excellent, and that's the heart of the movies. However, Oscar-nominated Thelma Ritter wins the honors, her Moe is loud and as sordid as the surrounding characters, but she has a tired heat that Ritter transmits majestically. <br /> It's a B-movie in texture but a film in progress, Pickup On South Street is a very classy and entertaining film that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10
