It was a wonderfully intelligent and entertaining film that I will never tire of watching much, many times. The cast was beautiful by matching the young to the older characters. There are some of us who really appreciate good actors and a smart story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and is a gift for any type of production in which she plays. I always want to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and it is a pleasure to see each transformation of her character come to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding image, because most of the more recent films lack good characters, good scripts and a good action game. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant dummies, who lack ingenuity and talent. What a marvel to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I wish this film wins the awards it deserves. Thank you again for this wonderful night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, the director, the producer and all those who have done such a good job.
