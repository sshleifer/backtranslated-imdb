I like Peter Sellers most of the time. I had never seen him portray a British man of the upper class before this film. He's doing pretty well, even if you see Inspector Clouseau's pieces in the mix. It does not get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I did not expect Hawn to achieve such a solid performance. His timing was perfect and his expressions were invaluable. The way she shoots alternately the lustful character of Sellers and the seduced is beautiful to watch. Verbal fights as I have rarely seen in a film of this era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the film ARE GONE OUT. It's worth wasting time just to see the top sixty. Hawn is naked for a few glorious seconds at first. Enjoy it ...
