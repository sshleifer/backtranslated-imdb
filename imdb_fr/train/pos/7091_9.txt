The big problem is knowing where to start because this film needs your attention the next two hours and it is better not to miss a few minutes to take a coke because there is a danger that you can not follow. But there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis has to go into a memory machine to find an antivirus against a virus that made animals reign over the world in 1996. With some mistakes, he ended up in 1990, then in the First World War and what it might look like Terry Gilliam offers what must be one of the smartest scripts of all time. This ex-man from Monty Phyton knows just how much the SF-story genre should be told as it should and his casting choice could not be better. There's the crazy Brad Pitt (his performance at the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he's more than some Schwarzenegger-want to be. It's a movie you can watch over and over again because the screenplay is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that each display has other surprises in store for you. One of my big favorites.
