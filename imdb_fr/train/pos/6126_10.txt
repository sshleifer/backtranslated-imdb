I saw Jack Frost at Â£ 4.00 at my local store and I thought it was pretty good for a low-budget movie, so I bought it and I was right, it was good. For starters, this movie is about a snowman killer, so it's something that makes you laugh and whose look is funny compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The acting game was good and the Jack Frost replicas made me laugh "I only made you smoke for a cigarette" and "The most trapped worlds out of the cone of snow "are they funny and camp? At first, the story was rather funny and ridiculous: "Jack, be quick, Jack, be quick, Jack got his eyes broken with candlesticks". If you're looking for a horror full of word games for B-Movie Comedy, check out Jack Frost. 10/10
