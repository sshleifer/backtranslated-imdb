"The Luzhin Defense" is, in the foreground, the story of an idiosyncratic chess scholar (Turturro) who is consumed by play and, in the background, through flashbacks, his childhood and forces that created the man he has become. Factor of good and evil in the forms of his love interest (Watson) and his former "mentor" (Wilson), you have a plaintive drama sown with poignant and delicately humorous moments mixed with the rich beauty of Lake Como, in Italy, and high chess intensity. An excellent film for lovers of period dramas, the metaphor of the author's euphemistic chess game for orgasmic pleasure is an indication of the subtle spirit behind the film.
