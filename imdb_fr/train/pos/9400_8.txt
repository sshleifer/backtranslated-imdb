If the man in the white suit had been made in America, do you see neither Danny Kaye nor Jerry Lewis trying Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton for size? <br /> <br /> This is one of Alec's best. Guinness movies and certainly one of the best movies made by Ealing Studios in the UK. This fits perfectly with the timetable of the new Labor government and the society it was trying to create. It's amazing how, in times of crisis, capital and labor can match. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness, this modest little man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothes that will never need cleaning, that repel all kinds of foreign matter the minute he touch the garment. <br /> <br /> He is a persistent oath and he succeeds. Of course, the implications have not really been reflected on the type of impact that clothing will have on society. In the end, everyone chases him like a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre of M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> This is the hallmark of a great comic film that a potentially serious situation, such as the lawsuit described in some of the serious movies I just mentioned, can be played for laughs. The combination of poor Guinness is not only white and stain-resistant, but it shines like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> In addition to Guinness, the best performances are those of Cecil Parker, another pompous Joan Greenwood, his mermaid daughter and Ernest Thesiger, the largest manufacturer of clothing in the United Kingdom> <br /> <br /> Well, did Paramount get this suit out of Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
