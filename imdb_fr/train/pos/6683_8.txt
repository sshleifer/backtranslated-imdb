Forget the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door and have fun with this "cartoon" maniac, totally absurd and ultra-campy. MYSTERY MEN includes all the superhero movies you've seen, but his unlikely super-wannabes are so interesting, varied and well presented that they are memorable characters. Black humor, total stupidity, action in good faith and even touching moment, contribute to make this comical fantasy on the adorable losers a real winner. The comedic talents of the actors who play Mystery Men - including a Mystery Woman - are a perfect counter-support for Wes Studi, which can only be described as a boon, Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most casual. Wall (and strangely charming) villains never walk on the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and on the big screen. Get ready to laugh, cheer and say "huh?" more than once .... enjoy!
