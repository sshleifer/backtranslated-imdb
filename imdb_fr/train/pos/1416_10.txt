The Earth is a must for children and adults. My son had a lot of fun watching all these funny birds and beautiful bears. We can learn a lot from this film and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. Some animals may disappear. Exactly this problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary features many exceptional images that I have never seen before. Then he is well accompanied by heavenly music. The director has done a great job that is very respectful. Nothing can prevent my family and myself from giving Earth the highest rate. I hope so much that it will create a sequel.
