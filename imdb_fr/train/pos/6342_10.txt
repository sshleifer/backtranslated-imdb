In a word - excellent. This is the movie. Go see him. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard did a fantastic job, as he usually does. Incredible attention to detail, bright colors and decorations, a breathtaking atmosphere at Whoville, an amazing variety of costumes. Wait, there is more than that - the story is very good too. Attentive viewers must clearly extract a message. Jim Carrey is first rate. He is probably the best Grinch possible. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is really good. I'm sure she has a great future. The dog is cool All in all, it's a Christmas fairy tale of very high quality. If you like fairy tales, this is for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Read other reviews here ... Earn a living. It hurts me every time to see people who ... well ... have their hearts too small.
