Some say "The game is the most important thing", or something like that, is attributed to that old Bard of Avon, himself, William Shakewspeare. if it was not Will, maybe it was our own very experienced director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. Many of his films would support this hypothesis. None is more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The film also wins another award, being named as Errol Flynn's favorite among his own star vehicles. This clearly shows on screen that viewers sitting in the darkened theater or watching them on their TV or DVD at home would conclude the same thing. <br /> <br /> Of course, the story is semi-serious. Biopic, who takes a portion of factual material and mixes it with a liberal dose of ancient imagination to bring us a very satisfying scenario, albeit somewhat fictitious (what Biopic is not?). <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent because it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our lead, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although not a swashbuckler, a western or a picture of war, this GENTLEMAN JIM is perhaps the star role that best suits the Australian accident. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic boxing team in 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in "soft science" are clearly highlighted throughout the film and particularly in the "Big Fight" for the world heavyweight championship with the great John L.Sullivan, Himself. (Expertly played by Ward Bond) The cast reads as a service list of Warner Brothers resident support players. Alan Hale, the father of Jim Corbet, operator of Livery Wagon *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two "blue-collar" men in the family, their occupations being declared "Longshormen". <br /> <br /> The great Jack Carson makes his usual magical sobre-comic performance in support as a friend and bank teller colleague of Jim Corbett. John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Watson Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields and Dorothy Vaughn, to name a few. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh has also used a number of professional wrestlers in the roles of various boxers. So we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis and an unknown Grappler * who are described as the 2 waterfront pugs in the early scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (heard about him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a powerful but unpolished look that the old Pier 9 fighters would have possessed. <br /> <br /> We did not forget Leading Lady, Alexis Smith. She is powerful in her characterization of "independent" woman, while maintaining enough real abilities as a comic in many scenes. She stands out a lot as a poor little rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients at your fingertips, the trick is to mix the elements in proper proportions to get the perfect blend. Well, Director Walsh does it with reckless abandon. Because he's looking for a good movie first and foremost. His treatment shows all the skills he had perfected, starting with his days as a player with DW Griffith Mr. Walsh seems to have a particular fondness for this period, that of the 1890s. *** Mr. Walsh's management runs through the screenplay quite quickly, smashing the show scenes with a humorous typing line, "the Corbetts are in it again! Therefore, he is able to keep a light, even humorous touch to a story that could become too dull and serious. <br /> <br /> In addition, in an almost unnoticed element, Brother Walsh gives us an authentic San Francisco look of the 1890s. And as another example of his penchant for that period, he creates wide and dynamic images of the historic Prize Fights There is a vibrant and joyful mood conveyed in these boxing scenes.To crown this big film perhaps underestimated, the director Walsh took a look on the picture, as if it were an illustration from The Police Gazette, which covered such events in those "old days". <br /> <br /> But there is only one thing to remember before looking. If it's the first time or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> "THE CORBETS ARE AGAIN !!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion of Film and Pro Wrestling historian, this sounds like Tor Johnson, who, a few years later, was a favorite of director Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> ** A Livery term is a somewhat archaic term for a local rental vehicle. transport in town. <br /> <br /> *** That's right. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a veteran Griffith player. He was the actor to interpret John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to keep his own memories of the 1890s and the Sullivan-Corbett Championship Game and what it meant for sports life in America these days.
