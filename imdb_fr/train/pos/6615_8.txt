I am happy to be able to say more or less that positive things about the film with Karas and sisters Tasuiev, RENAISSANCE. <br /> <br /> And first of all, it's as it should be; An adventure for boys, RENAISSANCE is the story of an investigation by a police officer looking for a young scientist who has disappeared? Ilona Tasuiev, the geneticist and researcher of Avalon. <br /> <br /> The story of Karas, Ilona and Bislane is, although much less known than SIN CITY, the best film, and the most appreciated connoisseur. For French comic book lovers, this will make even more sense (I have enriched my collection of French comics last week, although I am not yet aware of it). The atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are all nice and endearing. A high-ranking Paris police officer, Karas, is looking for a young woman who was a rising star in medical genetics research, Ilona Tasuiev, a slightly hot blonde, whose rebellious sister Bislane was erotically preferable, I suppose. <br /> <br /> For me, a former comic book and television series lover, RENAISSANCE, a wonderfully beautiful comic, has been compared to an episode of WILD WILD WEST - here, a mythological past replaced by a future just as mythological - more blazon and jaded but, in a sense, as exciting. RENAISSANCE is not suspenseful; he does not seem particularly good ?? rhythmic; but it's seductive and hypnotic. Moreover, it allows us to draw, even briefly, a world, a real world, and we will think of Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Mueller, the Tasuiev sisters, as well as Goran, Farfella and Karas who recount his childhood. far away at the Kasbah. . I liked the feeling of RENAISSANCE, a certain gentleness, affability and adventure, as well as the professional and assured look; Among these new drawings, this one and Linklater's adaptation to Dick (Dick's only and first adaptation to date) stand out for me as works of beauty and true enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I thought that futuristic devices were appropriate and, when it is not conventional, strangely strange (like invisibility suits). <br /> <br /> As appropriate, the characters have exotic names, such as Bislane and Farfella, mainly from the world of arts and entertainment (Goran and Ilona). and Naghib ??). <br /> <br /> Nobody seems to have noticed that RENAISSANCE's poster has a Rourke look-alike - this guy is Marv; which does not make it a scam of SIN CITY, but not a model of originality either, and in fact, there is more resemblance to Miller's story, namely the dark futuristic look of a dilapidated society , the brilliance of the hero (in fact, a cross between the character of Willis and the character of Rourke in the previous movie ??) ?? on the other hand, this caricature breathes a more public air, a straight adventurer's edge, and in a word, it's like SIN CITY for kids, well, naughty kids, I mean, because there's a little nudity on the display. To what I said, one could argue that the traits mentioned are characteristic, even if they are clich√©s and commonplaces of the look of the more adult futuristic comic book; That's quite true, and it was old Miller to bring these things to the screen and RENAISSANCE has similarities here and there. Now, it is also fair that each RING has its ERAGORN, so for each winding city, its rebirth. I admit to being rather partisan of these dark futuristic stories, a little demanding specialty.
