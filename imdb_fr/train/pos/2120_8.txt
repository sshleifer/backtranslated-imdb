James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play in a gift shop in Budapest with colleagues who do not really like each other, not knowing that they are really dear friends who still have to meet. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, very endearing played by its two friendly stars and a support cast very eager to please. The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (I do not know how to explain it) that today's movies simply do not have. This can obviously be compared to the recent You've Got Mail and its original winner in every way. <br /> <br /> It's mandatory to watch every Christmas, I do not see any better way to start a Christmas feeling than this little gem.
