Based on a true story, this series is a jewel of its kind. The slave who becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man of the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond mining town of Tijuco in Brazil, the diamond sponsor - appointed by the King of Portugal - is the ultimate authority. Having grown up in the relative safety of her home, the young and beautiful Xica da Silva discovers her threatened world when he decides to sell her to a brothel in town, refusing to acknowledge that a black slave could be her daughter. In a desperate attempt to escape, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the commender for the king, with the intention of using them to escape. The king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the next day and when the booty is missing, the diamond manager is taken into chains, his family dispossessed and thrown into the street with only the clothes on his back. Martin, the diamond's son, swears vengeance. Xica and the other slaves, however, are auctioned off and Xica ends up in the house of the sergeant major, an old man who bought her only to calm her lust. The city of Tijuco, meanwhile, receives the new diamond commissioner, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes. Struck immediately by the beauty of Xica, he manipulates the sergeant major to sell it to him. Thus begins a love story full of dangers, intrigues and passions, between a noble volunteer and a clever slave who gets up to become queen. <br /> <br /> The series is full of rich details of the time beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And it really manages to captivate your attention every minute. Sometimes funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of suspense and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is really a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
