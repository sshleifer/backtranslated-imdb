Nick and Kelly are ready to get married but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change Kelly's honeymoon. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick enjoys drinking, smoking and playing pool with friends for fun, but Nick suddenly refrains from this type of fun. Sex is the only thing he likes because he wants a child. We discover that an alien race is dying and must be mixed with women of the Earth to save their people. It becomes a battle of survival between humans and extraterrestrials, with the canine population also involved. A beautiful movie.
