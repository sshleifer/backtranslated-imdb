First, I did not know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> Every time someone brings back a kind of cult film and adapts it to the present, something is lost inexplicably in the translation. <<br /> This is not the case here. This film is just starting on the right track. It is partly a familiar territory but manages to win too. Crockzilla scene someone? This must be seen and just try to keep an impassive face. This film takes up some of the classics of the fun movie cult and manages to integrate seamlessly into a modern production. It's good to see someone fill the needs of this market. Very well done. <br /> <br />
