It was good for a low-profile film that few people have heard of. This is another of those modern and bizarre British crime movies ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not wild like "Snatch" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a late and somewhat predictable end, but at the beginning of the series - not too late - has some twists to make it very interesting for the viewer for the first time. Basically, this is a discreet British man who sends for a "Russian mail order bride" who, with the help of two Russian male friends, ends up offering him one or two big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman are very co-stars, as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Russian cohorts of Kidman. It's a different kind of film and well played. Kidman proves once again that she is more than just a beautiful face.
