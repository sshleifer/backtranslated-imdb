OK here is what I say: <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent. I am a big fan of Nancy and I read all the original books 1-56 and I kept reading more. I am now on 96. Beware of scoundrels who attribute to this film a note lower than it should have. All clues suggest a wonderful movie! I loved everything. So, what is Nancy in the present time. She is always old-fashioned as in books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's opinion. I read them all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the movie spooky. I loved the exciting car chases and get away. I loved the clues. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you go see it because people who have complained do not know anything about a good movie and B about Nancy Drew. Go see him. It may not be worthy of an Oscar, but it's really a good movie.
