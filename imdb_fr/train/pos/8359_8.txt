Bertrand Blier is indeed the terrible child of French cinema and in the seventies, he could always shock the public. Filmed with his favorite duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual dose of sex (Miou-Miou plays its typical role, at least that of the seventies, because we did not know that a decade later, she would be the best French actress of all time). In the first place, "Les Valseuses" is also one of the first roadmovies since the spectator is brought to some trips by two small criminals. Those who are only satisfied with family life or simply do not know anything more, the film would be quite shocking but this film is more than that, it just lets you think about all the usual things in life (working for the car, be limited to work, etc.). It is a kind of criticism of the hypocritical society in which we live. Great job and it just makes you want two things: Dewaere died too young because he was an actor and, of course, Depardieu, he would have done better to stay French. movies as he proves here that no one can beat him. Classic timeless and 20 years later, it will shock again ...
