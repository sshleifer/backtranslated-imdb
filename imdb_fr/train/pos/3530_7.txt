I can certainly admit (as a geek IMDb) that "Phantom Lady" will never be part of the top 20 of my film noir. It may even be that he is not in the top fifty. But instead of discrediting the film because it is not as good as many other classics of the black genre, it should be noted that "Phantom Lady" contains enough strong and durable images to make a worthy film interest. The viewer only needs the ability to go beyond this awfully slow start. <br /> <br /> The movie only starts cooking when "Kansas" (Ella Raines) starts trying to prove everything but herself. the innocence of his boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. "Kansas" is Anderson's secretary on the day and the amateur detective at night. As a novice detective, she did quite well by working nights in the streets of New York. Little by little, she begins to assemble pieces of a mystery murder. To be honest, the film belongs to Raines and it is only thanks to his presence that the film works well. One way or another, she is able to give life to a film about a convict who is not interesting. I'm not sure that this fragmented dynamic of a character without a character becomes the fault of the actor or the director, but it is clear that something is not going at all in the film. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines is As a beginner detective, "Kansas" visits a wandering drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) looking for information that will help him find the boss condemned. With her drummer, she painted a new red in the city by visiting the jazz clubs "All Night". Trying to describe this scene will prove an injustice or worse, it could ruin everything. You will know the scene once the last crash of the cymbal has finished ringing. If you are lucky enough to have this movie on DVD, you will probably be rewinding this scene again and again. As good as Raines is, it is this scene that makes this film remarkable. It's mainly because of this scene that I attribute to "Ghost Lady" a 7 instead of 6. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this film is warm and sweet with some great scenes and a beautiful scene. This is the "drum / sex scene" that separates this film from all the others of the same genre. <br /> <br /> And as it says in the movie that "you never go wrong with Vanilla", I would like I would also add that "go with Vanilla" is the safe choice when we can not decide to have a more tasty treat. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
