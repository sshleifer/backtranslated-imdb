Although Kurt Russell was and probably remains the closest person who looks like Elvis in show business, so many things were wrong in this movie. First, the filmmakers claimed that Elvis had opened his famous concerts in 1969, after nine years at the movies wearing a white tracksuit made in 1972. They also claimed that he had sung "Burning love", his first singing in 1972 and "The Wonder of You" that he recorded for the first time in 1970. They also claim that he had his first guitar for Christmas while all fans of Elvis know he has it had for his birthday. I know that all the films based on the past have something wrong, but these things are so obvious to those who love Elvis.
