The DVD of "Danaza Macabra" (Blood Castle) is very strange. Indeed, some parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed in English from French. Sometimes, the characters passed from one to the other in the middle of a scene! When I tried to get a movie just subtitled or just dubbed, it made no difference! Bizarre, but still observable. <br /> <br /> The story claims to be based on a Poe story, although I do not remember which one. In fact, the character of Poe appears at the beginning and the end of the film - although he does not look like him particularly. <br /> <br /> A rich man makes a bet with a guy who is lucky he can not stay home all night. This seems like an easy bet to win, even if the house is very scary. However, this can not be so easy, because the rich states that all those who had previously gambled are dead - and yet this fool ALWAYS wants to bet! At home, he meets Barbara Steele and falls in love with her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than ten years ago! How can this be?! I could tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to spoil the suspense. See for yourself to discover the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film gets very good ratings for creating a goose-bumpy atmosphere. The house, the black and white cinematography and the music contribute to the production of a scary film. Regarding the plot, it's interesting - especially because of the many twists - as long as you wonder who is and who is not one of the undead at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake who was killed needlessly. As crazy as it sounds, I felt sorry for that and it seemed barely necessary. <br /> <br /> In addition, parents may want to know that at the end, there is some nudity. A woman of striking beauty seems topless, but it's not really necessary for the plot.
