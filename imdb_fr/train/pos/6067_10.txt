Although I am inclined to accept the other comments of people who have seen this film, I am ashamed to say it, I like it rather. It's not common to find such a big pile of 80's documents outside of a Wham! video, so it's definitely worth watching (Â£ 0.79 a night in my local store!). Pay attention to the incredibly obvious seams and zipper of the monster's costume, the fact that the "hero" is very much like Keith Chegwin and classic lines such as: Evil Wizard-Type Bloke: "We finally meet Kor ... "Kor:" It's exciting, is not it? "<br /> <br /> Incredible! I also like the fact that the video box looks very exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous hawk - like a bird carrying a handsome hero in safety (among other suggestions "Interesting and engaging" about what's going on in the movie, none of them really happens No, I'm not kidding ... there's not really anger, sea or a fierce bird is just trying to interest you ... classic in my opinion.This movie gets 10 for pure entertainment value !!
