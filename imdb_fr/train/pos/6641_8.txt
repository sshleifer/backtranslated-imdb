On December 28, 1895, at the Grand Café in Paris, the story of the film was self-written, while Louis Lumière showed his shorts, all singly, to a paying audience. 'The exit of the light factories' was the first film to be played and I would like to be there, not only to see the film, but also to know the reactions of the public. <br /> <br /> We start with the closed doors of the Lumière factory. Apparently, since the picture looks like a picture, people thought they were just going to see a slideshow, not something they hoped for. But then the doors open and people flock, returning home. First a lot of women, then men and a man on a bike with a big dog. When they are all outside, the doors close again. <br /> <br /> Whether or not the first film (some say "The arrival of a train to the ciotat" was the first film recorded by Light), it is an impressive piece of beginning of the cinema. To be bored by this is almost impossible for several reasons. A simple reason: it only lasts fifty seconds. But also for people who normally only enjoy special effects movies, there must be something interesting here; you can not see historical things like this every day.
