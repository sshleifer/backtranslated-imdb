I saw this film on TV and I could not turn it off. Peter Sellers embodies an unbearable character who craves for an extremely warm and cute Goldie Hawn (who would not want to?). The way Goldie's character stands from the beginning to the end of the film is still unconventional. This film gave me a different angle in human relations and I also found it very funny. Peter Sellers' role has been a difficult sell, but I think he's doing well.
