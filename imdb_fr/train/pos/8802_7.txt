It's a very interesting project that could have been quite brilliant. Gather eleven leading international directors and allocate each one 11 minutes, 9 seconds and an image to create a segment of their choice; Each short film explores the global impact of 9/11. Without using spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach's play is the jewel in the crown and that the short film by Mira Nair (segment "India"), based on a true story, deserves to be turned into a feature film. We also realize, watching his short film, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today ?? he is simply a master of the medium, who also has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 pieces are made equally. Youssef Chahine, in his segment "Egypt", assumes the Arab position of self-inflicted collective guilt, a piece that could have been potentially the most interesting. He fails miserably. Chahine's short film is poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among the other top chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance of quality, I still give 7/10 to the concept, if not the execution.
