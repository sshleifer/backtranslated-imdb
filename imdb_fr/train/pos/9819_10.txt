It is a great film of the lost age of the reactionary television drama. Robert Culp, my favorite actor of all time, skilfully traces a trajectory based on stuck Liberal fair play and trust in the system, excessive conservatism, fear of crime and homicidal psychosis. Teenagers are a collection of sneering perverse stereotypes and the final message of this film gives an appearance of comparison to Dragnet's episodes. But what really shines is the steady pace of the film, which gradually builds fear and paranoia, as well as the atmosphere of the entire California backdrop. The cars are really good too, if I remember correctly. I give this movie a 10, and I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Do not forget that it's not because it's made for television that it's not great art.
