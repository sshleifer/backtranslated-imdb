In October 1945, the German-American descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt and his uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård), a bitter man, finds him a job as a sleeper driver in the Zentropa train line. . As he travels on the train to learn his trade, he sees Germany occupied and destroyed and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), daughter of the former head of the transport sector and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg) Leopold remains neutral between the Allied forces and the Germans and realizes that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" killing sympathizers of the allies and carrying out subversive actions against the allied forces. He falls in love with Katharina and earlier she reveals that she was a "werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also pressed by the "werewolves" and must take a stand and make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Europa" is an impressive and agonizing Kafkan story by the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and alternating a beautiful black and white cinematography with some colorful details, this film reveals a difficult time in Germany and some of the problems that this great nation faced after being defeated in the war. Very impressive the action of the occupying forces to destroy resources that could allow a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has an astonishing performance in the role of man who wants to remain neutral but who is manipulated everywhere by everyone. The hypnotic narrative of Max Von Sydow is another touch of class in this award-winning film. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europa"
