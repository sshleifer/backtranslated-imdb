While repeating Carmen de Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) invites the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play the lead role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, an independent and seductive woman unable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is thirsty for jealousy, like D. José in the original opera, mixing fiction and reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great film from Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to flamenco dance. The dramatic love story is developed with the life of the artists related to the characters they repeat, and it is often not clear if what happens is a reality (with the dancers) or a fiction (from the play ). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of Bizet's famous opera, based on the novel by Prosper Mérimée. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
