This film is good. As a former US Air Force Air Cadet, I can tell you that this movie has it all. The boredom of the application process. Waiting for a word. The joy of acceptance. The desire to succeed the course. The sorrow of watching his friends (perhaps the best of them) fade away. Anxiety to pay the ultimate price - the death of many student airmen. The glory of graduation. Always theft, theft, theft. Many are called but few are chosen. We paid for what we would have paid with impatience.
