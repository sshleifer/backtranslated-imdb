This movie is absolutely fantastic !! If you look at it with your friends, the day may be very nice ... Of course, you must know that the movie is stupid and very bad, realized and played (Tomba / Unziker, which couple), and that's probably the worst movie in the world, but you can enjoy it a lot. We watched it at 19 and it was a very good evening. The best scenes are the first, when the criminals kill Alex's friend, and he tries to behave like a desperate, the result is a top-class comedy scene ... And then, when he shows Leva (Antevleva, what a name) the "Palassio di giusstissia", then the accident of Leva, that once his car gets out of the way, and a second later, it is completely empty! What magic!
