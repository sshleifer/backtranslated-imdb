In the series of films cited The Movies of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as the pivot of a musical. I certainly can not do better than that. It's such an important film in the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not hurt too much with that either. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer had lent Gene Kelly to Columbia where Harry Cohn had the inspiration to let Kelly choreograph her own numbers and because of that, Cover The Girl has become a classic. So, if Mayer did not learn the lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did it and allowed Kelly to take over artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire finally had a dancing rival for the monarch of dance at the movies. <br /> <br /> The main number that everyone is talking about with Gene Kelly is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally, Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney did not lend Mickey to anyone. Mickey should wait for Who Framed Roger Rabbit to make an outdoor movie. Do not worry because MGM had his own animated rodent, half of Tom and Jerry's team. <br /> <br /> Kelly as a dancer has always tried to do something new and different on the screen, like Fred Astaire. For a dozen years they were allowed to exercise all sorts of artistic control and were praised for their work, even though the films themselves were not up to par. It was as if everyone inspired the other to greater and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and many other studios. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly did a little Sinatra dancing. In fact, Frank Sinatra has always paid tribute to Gene Kelly for showing him how to do musicals, just like Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for the help he had brought, which earned him an Oscar for From Here to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra was bought half of his contract from RKO by MGM, he insisted on having some artistic creativity. He had become friends with the composition team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In her autobiography, Sammy Cahn explains how Sinatra insisted they write her songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote very good ballads to allow him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I fall in love too easily. Frank sings as he accompanies himself to the piano in an empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and, later, with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn has earned the title of putting more lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person. These are long-time friends and Cahn has always credited Sinatra with this breakthrough in her career. <br /> <br /> On a bet, Styne and Cahn said they could write a song using only a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a sudden My heart sings. She has also done classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here, singing is actually the basis of the plot. Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew, Dean Stockwell, meet two sailors on leave for various reasons. In trying to arrange it with Sinatra, Kelly says he can make her audition with Jose Iturbi. They spend the movie trying to accomplish that. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment at Anchors Aweigh is that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress "Brooklyn", never had a number herself. She got rave reviews after her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I suspect she had a cut number and somewhere in MGM's coffers, he could still be. <br /> <br /> Aweigh Anchors is a great example of why musicals are simply no longer being created. All this creative talent was under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If you had to pay the market value, the cost could pay off the debt of a third world country. <br /> <br /> But the results of the film would be extraordinary.
