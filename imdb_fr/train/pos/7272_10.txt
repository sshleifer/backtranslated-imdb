Before you begin, let me tell you how great this stand-up sound is when playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (Red Mountain level in particular). So, while watching this special show, I suggest - no, ASK it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia pushes his positions to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There, he makes fun of everyone without any excuse. <br /> <br /> I thank God a little here that Carlos did not do his thing using the same joke again and again and again and again. He does a terrific job of mocking everyone and at the same time telling the truth. I know several times that I said, after Carlos had said a joke: "Damn, this guy argues a good point!" And then the Game Over screen came on my television because I forgot I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing wrong with this special show. If you have TiVo or something, do yourself a favor and save this historic time.
