VIVAH is in my book THE BEST FILM OF 2006! PERIOD !! In my book, it's one of the 100 best movies ever made in Bollywood. It is unfortunate that this film does not have as much criticism and is not so popular. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again a real feat on the part of a director who does it again. After HAHK and the Maine Pyar, Kiya Sooraj has once again achieved a brilliant VIVAH. <br /> <br /> Here are the most simple and cute movies I've seen this year. After seeing Don 2, who was CRAP and later, Dhoom 2, who even beat Don in this affair, I finally saw a film that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture we have and are currently doing Hollywood-style shit-like movies like Dhoom 2 and Don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and very much related to the arranged Indian marriage system which I too would like to join. Our system, which teaches us to obey the elders, to follow them and, of course, to obey their thoughts, is so brilliantly presented in this film !. Of course, the choice of your life partner has no strength and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and the choice of their choice, as brilliantly shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie ..... VIVAH is a journey story between the beautiful engagement period and the wedding. The phase where the guy meets the girl! .... Both understand each other. Both are trying to determine if they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and the various events that occur during weddings. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is fine ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome !! The songs are brilliant. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI HAND HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> All in all, all visitors must believe in Indian culture and tradition, and I as well! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just have to say a word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS!
