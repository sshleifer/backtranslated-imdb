My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the album Rheostatics of the same name that I bought around 1993. I read the notes underneath and the band said that this album, which occupies a special place in my collection, was inspired by Canadian author's book Paul Quarrington. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and I devoured it! An incredible reading! Since then, I have read the book many times, each time finding something new for Desmond and his desire to complete whale music. <br /> <br /> I found the film in 1996, on video. I did not have many good experiences with the Canadian film, but it worked for me. Claire's role could have been interpreted differently, but overall, I think Paul Quarrington's vision has been transferred from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin plays a moving role as an isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love and the search for someone who understands. I highly recommend "Whale Music" not only to music fans, but also to all those who have already lost something or someone and have tried to find their way back to the world.
