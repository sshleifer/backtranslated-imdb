I completely agree with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. A perfect casual movie on Sunday morning. The humor is subtle (as opposed to "slapstick", as noted by a commentator astray). <br /> <br /> But what always stops surprising me is the frequency with which I often find myself wanting to return to this film. Originally, I had copied this film on VHS about 12 years ago, during the first broadcast of one of these cable-free weekend previews (HBO maybe?). I had never heard of it before. I do not know why it was not marketed as well. ?? When DVDs came out en masse, it was one of the first movies I replaced. An excellent combination of casting and writing. In addition, the backtracking of Montana's wilderness does not hurt either (beautiful). <br /> <br /> This is probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler stuff is waiting for you, it probably will not be your cup of tea. This film needs all your attention. Humor is mainly in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I think my next viewing will probably be my 12th. But I still know that when there is a scene like the hood of the police cars starting to fly, I'll lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is NO PRICE!). Recommended at 110%.
