I know, I know: it's childish. But I love this type of film. A bird that has suffered a lot of "misadventures" and still has not lost faith in humanity and sense of humor. The peculiarity of this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie - the parrot - and that it is not used to stimulate a human actor. Plus, I like the script: Paulie tells his story to a cleaner when he reaches the bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice is almost like Joe Pesci's!) And Cheech Marin of course, the man is humor for me. Since I've seen "Up in Smoke", I appreciate his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious experience ... I can not help it.
