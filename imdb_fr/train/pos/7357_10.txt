OK where to start? ... This movie changed my life! The plot was transparent. James Cahill came out of himself. After a first viewing, I was disappointed not to have seen on the silver screen. However, it was before exploring the many features of the DVD !!!! Oh my god, the movie commentary by Jakes Cahill was almost as faultless as his acting. he recounted industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed by the other actors. The scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. I am certainly with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment without result. <br /> <br /> I'm still blown away every time I watch the martial arts techniques in play, which only shows the sign indicating the location of the school library ... and maybe the guy who plays a delay! In short, a timeless classic and the best film in Europe for years! where my Oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
