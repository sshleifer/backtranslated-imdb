This 1991 film on NBC-TV was broadcast six months before John Goodman's big screen release of Babe Ruth's life. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. Television production is not perfect, but it portrays Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional narrative. I particularly appreciated the movie's description of Ruth's complex relationship between love and hate with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood the talent of his star player and also tried to show why the flaws of his own character would never let him become manager or leader of players. The TV movie rightly notes that Ruth never realized her dream of managing the Yankees because of her faults, while the horrible version of Goodman tries to dispel the lie that Ruth was denied what should have been the his. <br /> <br /> This film is an excellent companion for "Eight Men Out" since the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox scandal and when his exploits at the house literally saved the baseball from ruin. Indeed, the continuity between the two films is accentuated even with John Anderson who resumes his role of "Eight Men Out" as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
