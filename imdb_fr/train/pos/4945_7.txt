It is a difficult film to classify "10 articles or less". Generally, I do not care to define the genres, but there is something in this film that makes you want to classify it in a specific category, in order to convey, even with a single word, your feelings about it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, and if you really like cinema and love life, you'll want to do the same once you're done watching it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film and call it beautiful and beautiful, admitting that it is not perfect but that it does nothing. I do not want to seem to contradict myself, but I think writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was doing when he finished writing this inspiring script. I'm sure he wanted to make a product that had nothing to do with perfection: a product as simple, attractive and uncompromising as its title. Well, he did it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long and complex drama films like "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", proves with "10 Items or Less", which ends in just 70 minutes, the passion has to his work and also the faith he has in him. Placing an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) in a grocery store and taking them exactly to the places where ordinary life would lead them, is what Silberling proposes here. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you more because, in the apparent simplicity, hides a stimulating background that should not be underestimated. Because here everyone is exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters, who argue endlessly in a car ride with stops that are not endless just because life is life. And let me express how Silberling is resisting the situation by saying that it reaches, in less time (not only the duration of the film, but the only day the film develops its events) and in a smaller place, the kind of link between two characters generated by Sofia Coppola in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> This film, which takes place in Tokyo, also met an actor and a woman. They also had a conversation about the times in which they lived. their lives. It is in conversations that we feel the provocative quality of "10 Items or Less" and, as in Coppola's film, the naturalness of each situation is never lost and the images with all the music and no words seem not forced or included in the image to "save time". <br /> <br /> In this aspect, the collaboration of Silberling and his director of photography Phedon Papamichael. The man who photographed the beautiful landscapes of "Sideways" and focused on all the emotions of "Patch Adams" enchants us here with visual passages of true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate beauty of "10 Items or Less" lies in his cast (by Avy Kaufman), in his two protagonists. They are the ones who convey this feeling that I mentioned at the beginning and that I can not specify; we feel their connection and we can say they have fun and they can even improvise stuff. Morgan Freeman, also an Oscar-winning executive producer, confirms his status in the film industry today, and he deserves it: a quiet, wise man who can easily crying can make you laugh. And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said she was great in "Spanglish") ?? Here, she proves that she is the real deal, and that Hollywood is not small for her.
