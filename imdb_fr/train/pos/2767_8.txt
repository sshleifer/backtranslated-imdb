Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. The last 15 minutes (or so) are excellent and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same can not be said of the rest of the film. It's not terrible and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (to be honest) to see it is Peck. For the rest, you'd better read the Old Testament.
