Richard Brooks, excellent 1967 film from Truman Capote's novel, IN COLD BLOOD, is an ideal complement to Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance in the 2005 edition of CAPOTE. They play really well together (try the different nights). It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that fit together so well. These two really reinforce each other. Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces are getting married. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks' films is weaker, as they give it a different name than Capote. I would suggest watching CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It's a powerful experience!
