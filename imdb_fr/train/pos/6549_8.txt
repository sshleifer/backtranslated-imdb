Taking the old collection of stories poses a challenge to the production team. How can this classic character be updated and interesting enough to capture a new audience while reminding him of the memories of his former audience? In my opinion, their mission was accomplished. Must-see for young children, pre-teens, teenagers and their parents. OK, there are some scary moments that are resolved quickly, but parents with young children have to sit tight, the film goes on to better things. I'm going to go with these clever critics of users who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive model for young women, not syrupy about it either. Nancy balances her femininity with career-oriented research skills. Many things to love here, laughter, do not take themselves too seriously, a real mystery to solve (a bonus you can imagine yourself, and friendly characters.) Nancy Drew even makes a good movie appointment in my opinion.
