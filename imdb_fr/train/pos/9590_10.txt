The documentary begins in 1986 in New York, where black and Hispanic drag-queens hold "bullets". It is there that they disguise themselves as they wish, strut in front of an audience and are put to the vote. We meet several members and see how they stand and support each other. As one man tells another - "You have three strikes against you - you are black, gay and drag-queen". These are people who (unfortunately) are not accepted in society - only at balls. There, they can be who they want and who they want and be accepted. Then, the film cuts to three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some). <br /> <br /> It sounds depressing, but it is not. Most interviewees are actually very funny and get a lot of humor from their situations. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor, as they should. We discover that they all live in "houses" managed by various "mothers" and that they help each other. The sense of community in this film is fascinating. <br /> <br /> When this film was released in 1990, it was controversial and was a resounding success. He has won the Best Documentary Award at many festivals - but has never even been nominated for an Academy Award. Their reason was "Black and Hispanic Drag queens are not part of the Academy". Fascinating is not it? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> Seen today, it's still an excellent film - and a period piece. It's just not like that - the NY they show no longer exists. Balls are always held but not in the spirit that we see here. The trail has also become more "accepted" in society (for better or for worse). And I heard that the houses are gone too. It's a little sad. I would like to know where these characters are. I know that two people have died of AIDS, but I have no idea of ​​others. And what happened to this man of 13 and 15 years old? <br /> <br /> Yet it's a one-of-a-kind documentary - fascinating, funny and captivating. A must see! Some 10. Where is the DVD ???
