It's really an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not be missed by all fans of the French film New Wave or Underground. There are hardly any opening or closing credits - we are simply immersed in the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting to play with our ideas about advertising and its relation to reality. Real and non-real lines intersect in a familiar way with documentary films, but this time we do so for the sake of consumption and marketing, not to describe the real.
