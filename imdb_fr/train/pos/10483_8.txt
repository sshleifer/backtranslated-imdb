Yes, this movie is predictable and certainly not a reward. But then he does not try to be what he is not. A fun adventure with real fun one-liners, a stellar and fun performance by Peter O'Toole, a realistic and realistic performance by Joan Plowright. The group's performance was on the spot, each playing his role in a deft and comical manner. The music was good but not excellent but filled the film well. From some negative comments, I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humor was passing over their heads. A good example is the commentary on the "weird game resembling baseball", and well, my dear American, it was cricket - from which baseball is derived - and his explanation to the ignorant American group was very funny to those who know him. . Besides, no, you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window; It was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" to get more money for the breakage and the director said at the same time "oh no" also referring to the money. God, it seems that each joke must be explained to some people ... In all, I liked and I laughed! It's worth the detour.
