I have not seen any of the Japanese Grudge films, but I really appreciate this one. I'm rarely scared when watching movies. I can jump if the effect and sound are surprising enough, but being afraid of a movie is a rare thing for me. But I was scared of Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I watched it. I did not expect to be afraid. I did not know anything either. It was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that, apparently, you like or hate. Most people seem to compare this to Japanese Grudge movies, but even though I have not seen them, I think it's not fair to compare a movie, actually. This film is independent. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, according to most people. I do not agree The story is minimalist and made on purpose. The narration techniques used - broken time for example - are perfectly mastered. The director knows exactly what he is doing and I think he has realized his vision as he pleases. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 8 out of 10. It's a movie you'll like to watch or hate. It's that simple.
