THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> A film based on a short story by Gerard Reve, which works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising, since Reve has about a hundred pages needed for a simple plot and tension is the last thing on my mind when I read his work. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is a heavy symbol. . Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely concerned about the idea of ​​something to prove critical for most hostile and I'm never sure what exactly trying to prove. He generally underestimates his audience and tells his story in such a subtle way. It quickly departs from the original idea or scenario and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In "The Fourth Man", it is not as explicit about the plot as it does with sex and nudity (of which there are many), but, as in most of his films, he seems to fear that the public does not understand it and strikes at home. the story with an obvious symbolism mixed with nude and supposedly shocking sex scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex or nudity in front, most of it is so gratuitous and unbearable that it undermines an otherwise good story. <br /> <br /> However, if you can cope with rather obvious satirical approach Verhoeven, this is a fairly entertaining thriller, with some intriguing twists and good overall performance, including Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
