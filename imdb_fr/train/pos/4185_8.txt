This film has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - botched editing, little or no continuity, insane dialogue, bad action game (we could even say nonexistent), storyless intrigue, blueprints Too far ... and it's perfect for the MST3K style riffing, not forgetting the "Corpse Eaters drinking game": scribble on the forms ... take a shot - sign your name ... take a shot - take a bad montage of Foley ... take a lot, many shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not score above 8 is because there is not enough free nudity and, despite his crazy insanity, he only lasts an hour - damn it, a movie like this should have lasted at least 20-30 minutes!
