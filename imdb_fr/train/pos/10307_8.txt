I really do not know what people have against this movie, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It's not a preaching, it's not anchored in morality, it should not be controversial. It's just God. Any god possible, no matter the religion. And it's really funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the news side, wanting to prove (more or less TO) that he can be taken seriously and that he can be taken to serious. do a good job in anchoring work. This driving is what slowly drives his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. When the last straws are executed, he hastens not to laugh, but shouts in the face of God, who in turn gives his powers to Bruce. Bruce then improves his life for himself, until he feels guilty of helping others, where he continues to miss the purpose of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant enthusiasm for his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> OK, it was a bit long. But as a plot, it works well. The gradual way in which we take up the challenge of being God is much better than grouping one's problems together, and is able to hide well enough. <br /> <br /> As you probably know from hearing about the movie in the first place, Carrey's perfect game remains in the character (which, thankfully, is him), and controls and gives an atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. Whether they admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, humor would become flat, because humor is a half-performance. And the humor is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, Jennifer Aniston would be great and, anyway, is not the only excuse for the third act. At least you do not think about it when you see it. It gives a sincere performance and makes you forget that you are watching a movie. Carrey and she really feel like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film looks ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a pleasant feel, addresses this idea appropriately and better than expected and, overall, it should never have been to be described as slapped just to save Carrey's career (which was nowhere else).
