My God. This film really shows the talents of the actors. Billy Connelly flexes his actor muscle. Really an amazing man, if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints in mad / killer, and finally in Fido in zombie! His character in Fido looks very cute, even scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hack either! Change of career, from Matrix and Momento to a darker character, to a conservative housewife of the 1950s! Rare these days to see actors who can not be so typed. <br /> <br /> Now on the screenplay (No Spoilers, do not worry). This film would make Max Brooks (Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z) happy! Finally a touch of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you're bored or busy, check out this movie!
