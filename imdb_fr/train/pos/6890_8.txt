This is one of the highlights of ST: TNG's second half-forgotten season, before they "grow" or become themselves in the third season and beyond. It was not only a showcase for beginners like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but also the quest for Data for his "humanity", this time through the concept of comedy. Another one of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> By the way, I'm always disappointed that no credit is given to the actress whose character, Okona, was about to have a date (after the character Teri Hatcher) before being abruptly interrupted by Lt Worf. I remember watching this episode 'first broadcast' in the comic shop of my friends at the time and we all thought she would have been a perfect girl of Jean Gray / Marvel. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know. who is this pretty woman ...
