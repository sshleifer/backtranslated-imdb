For a first film of a proposed series, the right balance is reached. This is done with style and class, illustrating the beginnings of Modesty as a refugee and the beginning of his rise to power in the criminal world. I think it's a very honest / true picture of his character exactly as writer Peter O'Donnell wanted it. Alexandra Staden as modesty is incredibly beautiful and an excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as a survivor with a cold / intelligent / innocent exterior. And all the congratulations to Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more believable to have a new face creating the role. I can not wait to see the next movie.
