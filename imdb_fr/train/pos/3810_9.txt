This is my first review on IMDb, I did not really want to write one, but as there are only two for this awesome movie right now, I feel obliged to add my point of view ... and not , I'm not associated with the filmmakers in any way (yeah how many times have you appeared here before ;-)) FYI I'm in the late 20s <br /> <br /> The first of all I must admit that I really like animated movies you see is limited only by the imagination of the creators and they were rather imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of history, but by achieving a unique visual style and fresh imo. The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a fairy tale world. But the background and the world in general are filled with impressive visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The mini-blue dragon, similar to a rabbit, directs the show and easily presents some of the funniest moments of the film. He is already an instant classic, just like Scrat of Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a group of anti-heroes must kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but it does not matter if the film looks and sounds as good ;-). The film is not suitable for VERY young children because it contains darker and perhaps scary scenes for children under 8, I would say that there are very few scenes but it should be mentioned imo. Anyway, I had a good time watching this and I was looking forward to seeing the high definition stores to watch it again and again just for the beauty of it. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
