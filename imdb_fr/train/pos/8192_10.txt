This two parts was excellent - the best since the return of the series. Some pieces of the story have been pinched in previous movies, but what TV shows do not do that these days. We arrived here. It was a good science fiction story. A big monster (really scary) imprisoned at the base of a deep pit, beautiful aliens in The Ood - the best "new" extraterrestrials that the revived series has invented, a set of human characters fundamentally friendly and believable (with two people useless "usable" security, fashionable Star Trek), large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and exceptional special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
