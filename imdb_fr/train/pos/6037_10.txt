What a great British movie, a happy and sexy laugh, Gary Stretch, and, oh, a lot of motorcycles and a beautiful Welsh campaign. <br /> <br /> The members of our club, the social club ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike, appear here. extras! Hooray !! <br /> <br /> There are truly hilarious scenes, a good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> Meeting with director Jon Ivay during a performance in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, down to earth and a good laugh. This film must be supported, as all great British films should! <br /> <br /> Go ahead, look at it if you can, they have a website with the cinemas that broadcast it, so find one near you! <Br /> <br /> I can not wait to get the DVD. Some of our biker friends have seen the movie two or three times and can not get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
