The only reason I did not give these 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, extras, etc. However, if you've ever dreamed of doing something in your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anyone or anything stop you. This is one of the most compelling films I have ever seen. And magic. The acting is superb, the plot serves the purpose, and the opening sequence is fantastic. This is one of those movies that the status of "cult" was about. I recommended this film to all my friends. Some like it, others can not finish it. Whenever I think or think something is impossible, I think of Alan Arkin's role in this film. Wish he made more movies.
