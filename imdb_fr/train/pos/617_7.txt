Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it does not live up to this classic, it is extremely entertaining and well designed. The story is a little strange and everything about the wall is never really explained, but the execution is satisfactory, even if it creates a strong suspense. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls in love with the bad girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to get him a fallen star ... played by the amazing Claire Danes. Not a lot of suspense about what's going on with these two, but the suspense part comes with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince's son Peter O'Toole who seeks to recover the ruby ​​necklace worn by our star". Many bad hunting good. <br /> <br /> On the way, an encounter with the weirdest pirate you'll see (including those from the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard inside, and will we tell in touch with his feminine side. Another meeting involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast-talking shopkeeper, which is good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical pursuit, the transition to adulthood or a fantastic movie, but director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer Cake") effort deserves an audience. Unfortunately, the bad marketing campaign will probably prevent him from making money. In my opinion, the success will be great in video.
