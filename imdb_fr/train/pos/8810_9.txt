I saw this movie for the first time when it aired on the now-defunct Trio channel a few years ago, and recently it was re-viewed - without ads - on Sundance. The first time, I was impressed and found that it was even more interesting during the second viewing. Yes, some segments are far from perfect - the hysterical commentary of Amos Gitai stands out as a sore thumb - but taken collectively, the 11 09 01 is a total success. Best Show: The incredible last segment of Shohei Imamura, that contemporary critics such as Mick LaSalle, a hard-headed man, has somehow misunderstood as an attack on "terrorists", but now proves to be a controversy masterful anti-war; Samira Makhmalbaf's first play, which brings deep empathy to the victims of 9/11 and a pressing concern for Afghan children; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's fun crusade for Osama bin Laden - an almost as serious hunt and a successful venture as the one for TRUE Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is a noble but failed experiment that at least has the courage to remind the public that bin Laden and Al'Qaeda are essentially creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and although Sean's study Penn seems out of place, she remains an effective bittersweet movie piece. Overall, the viewing essential and a much better view than the reactionary World Trade Center Oliver Stone.
