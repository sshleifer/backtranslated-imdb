Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it by their unique charisma presented in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the "alternative" or typical indie film with a scenario that presents a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an ordinary boy who has an old camera and whose main hobby is to photograph the exotic inhabitants of the small town where he lives. Suddenly, an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him to exhibit his work in some important festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life changes dramatically as fortune and fame seem to infuriate the inhabitants of the city who are Pecker's main inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend gets angry because he no longer pays him "adequate" attention. <br /> <br /> Well, it's an independent film with a benefit, but not for everyone. It may sound boring or pretentious for some people, but I still think it's worth looking at a watch just because it offers something "different" from typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> To describe in a few words: This is Ricci's typical Christina Film and John Waters. That's it. <br /> <br /> Oh and I almost forgot to mention that the lines "Full of Grace" are really annoying. Geez.
