I heard about this movie for the first time after buying the movie "Snuff" of 1976. I was told that the devil experience was much better, so naturally, I decided to order the box for guinea pigs. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen had come to try to ban this movie or the second movie. My interest has therefore been brought to a head. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short film without history or character development. . Only 3 men tortured a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in different ways, such as beating her, turning her round and round again, then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to high-pitched noise for 24 hours, crushing her hand with a mallet, burning and put on the larvae the burns, throwing him with guts and, finally, a sharp needle in his eye. <br /> <br /> I must say that a lot of this movie was wrong, like the scenes that beat. But then, part of that work was well done, with respect to your disgust. The scenes in which the woman turns in circles gave me the head that turns. Or the scene in which she has to listen to a high-pitched noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I did not stop when I looked at it, but I just thought, "God, that looks pretty good for a low-budget movie." I liked the movie but I do not know if I can really recommend it, unless you've seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
