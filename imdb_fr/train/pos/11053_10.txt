I was born only four years after the broadcast of this wonderful show, but fortunately I managed to watch the reruns of the mid-90s and the rest is history ... I became addicted. The premise was quite simple; two hardened Nemesis agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) team up with an expert (if not young), a doctor and biologist (Sharron Macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain so to recover a dangerous biological agent by red China. As they escape, their plane is hit by a machine gun and crashes into the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously unknown civilization that heals and strengthens the senses of the trio. exciting adventures to come ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted 30 hours and I guess it's its relatively short duration, a season, which earned it cult status. <br /> <The producer, Monty Berman, was famous for doing things as inexpensive as possible. At times, the show suffered from incredibly nil scenes - especially in episodes such as "Happening" (a replacement studio for the Australian outback) and the Snow 'sets of "Operation Deep Freeze" and "The Beginning", but if you can escape, and focus on the characters and scenarios, the show was really fun. There was a great mix of adventures and a lot of impassive humor (mostly from some great William Gaunt liners). <br /> <br /> The chemistry of the three tracks was fantastic - you feel like they were really having a lot of fun doing the show and this is confirmed in the documentary of the 2005 meeting where the three went meet after more than 35 years to remember the show (and laugh at the wicky wig Anthony Nicholls !!). They all shared the same screen time and all had their moment to shine. I have to say I've always been a fan of Richard Barrett - I loved his sardonic humor with that dangerous edge - he was definitely a man you had not come across, and those eyes ... the most blue would probably see on television. I have also followed Bill Gaunts' career with interest since. However, Craig Stirling would certainly have had his legion of female fans and I'm sure Alexandra Bastedo would have had a whole queue of male fans. <br /> <br /> The show also had a plethora of stars invited to seduce with, among others, Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> The episodes for me were: "Auto Kill", "The interrogation", "The fanatics", "The mission" and "The golden cage" but I'm sure everyone has their own personal favorites. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this show for the first time, or to watch it for many years, remember to look at it in the context of the time it was made and relax and enjoy - the characters and chemistry of the three main characters are what made this wonderful show for me and I think I'll never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
