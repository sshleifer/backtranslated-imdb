Red Eye is not the kind of film that will win the Palme D'Or, but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director, and his branding is a good indication of what a spectator can do. expect. <Br /> <br /> The fact that Red Eye is a small, compact, low-demand package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and demonstrates Craven's talent for producing light, but generally enjoyable, box office recipes. . In fact, this is the kind of film that is ideal to present as entertainment on the fly, which attracts attention without posing intellectual or emotional problems to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot gives the impression of being ridiculous, terrorist plot vague motivation and secondary characters, and the main section has a TV movie feel. However, there are precise elements of Hitchcockian suspense and echoes of Schumacher's Phone Booth, which is ultimately a more sophisticated (and pretentious) game about the same idea of ​​emotional crisis being suppressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses primarily on two people seated in air seats, he lives or dies on the characters and the screenplay. Cillian, Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams, a resourceful and resourceful woman, are the main reasons the film was taken away. Not only do they dialogue dialogue, but they also give a sort of Adam-like dimension to their battle of "male logic" against feminine "sensitivity". <br /> <br /> In the last part of the movie, Craven lets go a little. Shouts like a man-hunt-girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the Just for Men treatment, his omnipresent appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers, The Ring, and making him the sex-ed version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Short-haired fun.
