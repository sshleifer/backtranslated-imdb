(contains light spoilers) <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Of course, we remember Stewart as George Bailey of "It's a wonderful life" by Frank Capra, so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In "It's a wonderful life," Bailey sees the world as he would have been if he had never been born. In "The Far Country", Stewart's Jeff Webster, by not committing himself to helping anyone (except himself), sees essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) n 'does not exist. <BR /> <br /> By not getting involved (and trying not to worry about anyone), Webster is forced to see those for whom he can not help but get treatment, injury, moving and even being killed does nothing. It reminds the viewer that George Bailey was looking at a world that had been overthrown because he had also decided not to get involved without being born. <br /> <br /> Both films end with the same image: a close-up of a ringtone. Stewart, turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, has, it seems, won his "wings".
