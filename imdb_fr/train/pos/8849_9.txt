The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (clearly does not act together) need money. Andy offers a program to get a paste that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This film keeps its promises. This is a pure-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it's doing. As a crime drama / thriller, I would compare it to "No Country For Old Men". While both films have an abundant supply of dramas and character sensations, "Devil" is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. "No Country" is a colder and darker movie that you can really admire, while "Devil" is a little nicer. There is significantly less violence in "Devil" than in "No Country". The role play is also effective. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings to the besieged Hank the nervousness, sweat and deer-in-lighthouses look. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in the role of Andy, presents the hardest scenes of the film and is becoming the actor, which, according to you, can do everything. <br /> <br /> There is not really any problem with this movie. He hops without being confusing. Events become out of control, but the film never does: the writing (from the first to the last Kelly Masterson), staging (veteran Sidney Lumet) and editing remain as tight as the drums. In many categories, it is about caliber films, although films such as "The Departed" and "No Country" have escaped all hope. If you liked them, you will like that.
