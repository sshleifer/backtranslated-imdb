After seeing Vertigo, then look at Bell, Book and Candle, made a few months apart. <br /> <br /> My second favorite film of Kim Novak, with Picnic, coming third. <br /> <br /> The three performances are excellent, Vertigo being the best of all. <br /> <br /> They came to my town nowhere, Kansas Prairie, in Salina, Kansas, in the 50s, to shoot Picnic. The musical score of Bell, Book and Candle, I believe, is that of Alex North. Perfect for this piece of comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak did this comedy, as it's fun to notice the dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It's worth it if you like Kim Novak. The Greta Garbo of my youth.
