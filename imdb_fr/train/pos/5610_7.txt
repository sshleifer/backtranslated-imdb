Roman Polanski masterfully directs this kind of variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I can not imagine that an honest viewer will not be able to recognize the director in The Tenant, but the two parts of the film may not be entirely satisfactory to most people, myself included. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in The Tenant), starting with a lack of self confidence that will soon be transform into psychological malaise that will eventually turn into irreversible physical discomfort. The test shared by the characters and the audience is really different from the fear and tension of horror movies as there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror films allow for a sort of catharsis (whether cheap or more elaborate), Polanski sadistically tortures us and, if in his latest opus, black humor is permanent, we are especially on the nerves only on the edge of our seats. <br /> <br /> Suspense, horror, it's about playing with the public's expectations (or ridiculing and satisfying them), not with people's nerves. In my book, Rosemary's Baby is a much bigger feat, because paranoia and rationality are in constant struggle: we tell the story of a couple moving into a strange apartment, while we are forced to identify ourselves with a unique character. Moreover, if all the elements of fantasy are in the mind of the hero, the situation is particularly uncomfortable since we, viewers, are forced to judge it, to reject it while we have been masterfully seduced ("painters"). tempted ").
