I loved this film! It was so good! This film is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is offered to the little girl Mary as a gift. Paulie helps Marie learn to speak and they become better friends. But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent back. It is at this moment that the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so many things to find Marie. This film is so sweet, funny, touching, sad and more. When I watched this movie for the first time, it made me cry. The courage of the birds and their desire to go find his Marie during all this time were so touching. I must say that the end is so sweet and so sad, but you will have to watch it to find out how it's going. In the end, the concierge tries to help him after hearing his story. Will he find his long lost Mary or not? Discover it while watching this hot movie. It will touch your heart. Rating: 10
