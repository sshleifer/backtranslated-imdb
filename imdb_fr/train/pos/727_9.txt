One of the best rock'n'roll movies, if not the best. And it's not just crazy fun. There were really a lot of smart jokes in it. Of course, I love Ramones. But with all the anarchy and themes "I hate high school", the film does not take itself at all seriously, that's what's great about it. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie in the spring of 1980 and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me a little nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this film is not taken seriously and is not pretentious like many other teen products of the seventies, eighties and ninety. And to speak of, it's not really dirty or disgusting either. Only rated PG. It's rare for a film of this category. A great cult classic and a really amazing time capsule.
