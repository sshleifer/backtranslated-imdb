It's certainly one of the best films I've ever seen - it has it all - a really touching storyline, beautiful actors who make subtlety a beautiful art to watch, a really elegant romance (it's too bad that this kind of romance seems to no longer exist), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, as well as costumes and sets that make you want to live them. The end was a disappointment, as I was expecting a brilliant end to a spectacular movie - but it was even more wonderful than the vast majority of movies there. Check this movie definitely, again and again. There are many details that you miss the first time that deserve a second look.
