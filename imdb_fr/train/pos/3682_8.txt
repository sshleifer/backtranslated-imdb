Often, movies of this nature are a mixture of fantastic work and lightness to complete the execution cycle. Whether it's big name support or the project itself, Paris I love you never falls in this area. I think I can really say that the film as a whole is better than its parts. Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic end sequence, by fusing the characters into one last vision of love in Paris, I think the film would have suffered if one of the wheels had been removed. Certainly, there are some extras that overhang the rest, but in the end, I have a lasting image, even if it is only a fraction of a second of each short vignette. Love takes many forms and the talent of which it is here to surprise and move the audience through the sheared poetry and elegance of the many facets of emotion. <br /> <br /> Red Children's District: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises as an actress drug, filmed in Paris and meeting with her dealer. The revelation at the end leaves you a little unbalanced because the craze between the two hands changes. <br /> <br /> Latin Quatier: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (recreating a relationship from an old Cassavettes movie?) witty and sarcastic when they meet to discuss their imminent divorce. What of their conversation is true and what is right to arouse the anger of the other is nice, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Quays of the Seine: The director Gurinder Chadha offers us a moving portrait of the love existing beyond religious and racial differences. It's a little timid love story between two people who obviously feel a connection, but are unable to say it very loudly. <br /> <br /> Eiffel Tower: I will admit that I am disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not have an animated sequence. together, however, this action story featuring mimes who fall in love with a Parisian jail has the same offbeat nature as his film Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: The Coen brothers maintain their strange sense of humor and deliver some beautiful laughs. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without saying a word. His reactions to the face of verbal aggression by an unhappy Frenchman are invaluable. <br /> <br /> Bastille: This is the heartbreaking portrait of a love-loving couple who will not want to come back to tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson are moved as the couple struggling with problems and seeing how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pere-Lachaise: A surprisingly amusing little tale by Wes Craven, master of horror. A bit of humor Oscar Wilde can add lightness to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to be practicing the amazing catch long that he perfected in Children of Men with this story of two lovers, walking in the street. While Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier are getting closer, we also find the real context of their conversation about "forbidden love". <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: a very surrealistic look in Parisian glamor. This is probably the strangest, but so intriguing entry that you can not look away from the madness that follows. Do not annoy your Asian beautician, whatever you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at a relationship that is undergoing a role play that seems to have stalled for years. A little variety of Bob Hoskins is needed to light the fire. <br /> <br /> Madeleine District: Even vampires in Paris can find love between meals. I do not know if to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not. Beautifully filmed and cushioned to let the bloody red vibrate, this short film is strange, but love too. <br /> <br /> The 14th district: let yourself be inspired by the strange sense of humor of Alexander Payne to give it a little more depth This story dubbing tells the story of an American in Paris to discover what love is. His hard, uneducated French contrasts with the authentic accents we've listened to so far - quirky enough to be both funny and perfectly true to the story. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the procedure. Paris can be a passionate city for everyday activities like finding a parking spot, but when love is discovered, it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Far from the 16th: Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows that the love for a child lies in his subtle performance while the tale is written in the book, sung for a young child, but totally different each time . <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: My favorite tale of the group. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are just fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and the way destiny brings the two characters together so that Boro can finally ask him for coffee is hard to watch. Sometimes love at the last moment is enough to accept the departure of this earth. <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: one of the best stories about a mother trying to cope with the death of her young son. Juliette Binoche is devastating as a mother, desperate to have a last glimpse of her son, and Willem Dafoe is strangely perfect as a cowboy who gives him the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: it is sometimes necessary to think that he has lost the love to accept not having been fully invested in the relationship. Melchior Beslon remembers, trying to find where they have been mistaken by a series of crisp and quick cuts since meeting Natalie Portman to finally "see" how much he needs her. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Let Gus Van Sant tell us a story about the gap between communication and understanding, as his films almost always deal with a form of alienation. His photographer Elephant is an American working in Paris. He is the catalyst for Gaspard Ulliel's ramblings as an artist in love with the soul and his soul mate. Sometimes you do not need to know what you're saying to understand what's going on in the breaks.
