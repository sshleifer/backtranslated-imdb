This drawing was strange, but the story was actually a little more depth and emotion than other cartoon movies. We have a girl in a camp with low self-esteem and almost no other friend, except for a brother and a sister who are just miserable. It reaches its lowest point and when the opportunity arises, it literally concludes a pact with a demonic demon. I found this film very true to reality and when the situation could not be worse, the girl sees what she did, she feels remorse, then changes and then she helps that dark creature and mystical to learn the human quality of love. The twins also improve by helping little bears, and then they gain self-esteem. A very positive message for the children, even if some elements of the film were strange, it was and remains a rather pleasant film. The music of Stephen Bishop (Tootsie songs) made the film even better
