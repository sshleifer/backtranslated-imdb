I do not think a film like this would come out today. It takes time to present the depth of the characters and the plot is not full of twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But, what this film has: an interesting study of how families manage their grief. How, when the language of healing and of the immense loss overcome leaves us dumb and we rely rather on raw emotions. Grief without reason and patience are anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (a young boy who kills and kills his brother while hunting) in the film receives more than his share of the film. He finally leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes him understand that it was an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew this in his heart, but needed to hear these words from his parents and to receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I liked in this film: the lack of dialogue. The focus was on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. We do not have much to do with today's movies. <br /> <br />
