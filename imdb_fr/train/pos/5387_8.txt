Even in the twenty-first century, it is dangerous to procreate: women miscarry and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the service of "difficult cases" of a maternity. Loretta Young plays the leading role, a woman brought here from prison (her committed crime is not related to the plot) to give birth; she is in conflict over the fact that she will have to give up her baby after birth. She is in a pavilion with several other women, who share their joys and sorrows. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is the star, the outstanding performance, as usual, was directed by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, appearing quite often in supporting roles and sometimes taking the lead role in B-movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several parts of the film series " Torchy ".) Here, Farrell plays a pregnant woman who does not want her children because they will only annoy. She is doing everything in her power to prevent the nurses, including smuggling alcohol into the service (this of course during the blackout days) and drinking like a fish - apparently they had never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome in the country. 30. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike most early 1930s movies, it is not women who are embarrassing idiots who hinder heroic men. The situation reversed, the future fathers trembling jelly. (Watch Frank McHugh, a veteran actor, among the future fathers.) "Life Begins", as the first talker, treats the subject with a good dose of melodrama, of course, but it's a lovely little film. Turner Classic shows it, though rarely; I only saw him appear a few days in honor of Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to watch when it appears.
