This is proof of Gosha's incredible cinematic prowess, that he was able to finish Hitokiri and his astonishing masterpiece, Goyokin, the same year, in 1969. This is a proof of criminal underestimation which it shows for the general public (in relation to the media). like the great Akira Kurosawa), that Hitokiri and Goyokin received less than 500 votes between them. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu is Okada Izo: rabid dog killer, loyal to the Tosha clan and their Takechi chief, played by another of his kind, Tatsuya Nakadai. The Tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the shogunate. The historical backdrop is quite accurate - with Japan's growing political turmoil between the imperialists and the Tokugawa, and the pressures exerted by the West to end 300 years of social and political isolation. It is very useful to know a thing or two of Japanese history and what eventually led to the restoration of Meiji and the abolition of the Tokugawa shogunate, but it is absolutely not essential. The film was shot primarily for a Japanese audience, so some things are considered acquired, but it is also suitable for the uninitiated. <br /> <br /> As might be expected from a film by Hideo Gosha at his late 60s golden age) the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind the pictorial beauty. However, the style is never decorative for Gosha - he is always employed in the service of history. <br /> <br /> And speaking of history, Hitokiri is literally and figuratively dominated by the tortured main character Izo Okada. Like most of the protagonists of the chambara, Izo finds himself in a double moral impasse, torn between the giri (obligation) and the ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes him some time to realize what is exactly his giri. In the first half of the film, Izo tries to progress socially. Great aspirations of social rank and marriage with the daughter of an aristocrat - a great progression for someone coming from the peasant milieu in the rigid system of social castes of Japan of the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> The decisive moment for Izo is the moment when he realizes at what cost is the advancement of self, the loss of identity and therefore the loss of oneself. It was at this moment that he underwent a very symbolic transformation, from a famous swordsman of the Tosha clan to an unnamed vagabond, without a past or future, Torazo the wanderer. Although not technically named and not a derivative of the genre in Yojimbo's mold, it is the loss of his old self and the rejection of his ego, his ambition and his own illusion that allow Izo to see things as they really are and redeem themselves. <br /> <br /> Hitokiri ends (which I will not reveal here) in the best possible way for any story: positive or negative, with a deeply ironic touch that gives Izo the last word of laughter, one last sardonic remark in the face of death book.
