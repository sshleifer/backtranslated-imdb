For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a hidden gem in TGIF (and later, afternoon reruns). Each episode had a maniac, a zany energy and a quick stimulation that overcame the jokes sometimes clumsy. Melissa Joan Hart was a keen talent for physical comedy, especially in her facial expressions. Her two aunts, playing "straight men", or as straight as two witches could have, had good comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a talking cat, was free to take part in all the crazy projects that interested him. You could laugh and understand everything because he was, after all, a talking cat. Sabrina's friends completed the social experiment at the school, which also included the typical "cheerleader" and the "totalitarian leader". The most interesting and unique aspect of the show was perhaps the ability to merge pop culture (groups of the time, Jerry Springer, for example), the human condition / archetypal morality (for example, the importance of 'friendship, the spirit of Christmas' and the literal representation of such linked metaphors in the magical realm. Unfortunately, like many television shows, the show peaked in the first three years, coinciding with Sabrina's high school attendance. Starting in the fourth season, the transition to university marks what will become an abrupt decline in the overall quality of the series, especially when screenwriters choose to portray Josh as Harvey's rival and create a meager excuse for Aunts Hilda and Zelda remain on the screen. as key players. The last season, where Sabrina works in a pop culture magazine, was disappointing. Nevertheless, in the end, Sabrina (especially in high school) remains a unique entry as a hybrid sitcom with magical elements that elevates her above the tedious tariff produced each year in this genre.
