This film being the only Dirty Harry film that Clint Eastwood not only stars, but also produces and directs, you know it has to be good. Although some say The Enforcer is the best of the series, I completely disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of appearing in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with some good action footage, it does not have the dirty and cruel impact that the other three movies have. This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood movie good, and it contains the quotes that make a Dirty Harry movie good. In Diry Harry, it's "..Good then punk?"; in Magnum Force "A man must know his limits"; and in that it's "Go ahead, make my day." Also, in this film, it is nice to change the scenery, because we are a little tired of seeing the same old streets of San Francisco as in the other films in the series. With the very good acting of Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and a good staging of Clint, this is in my opinion the best sequel to Dirty Harry of all time.
