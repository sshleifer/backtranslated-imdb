Paramount, who ran out of money, did everything for this release of the 34th edition: big budget, big distribution, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen under the title of director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley did not work for off-center rock and a murder scenario that did not deserve to be in the same bin as Charlie Chan's worst-ever project in the street. I must believe that the cut was out of the hands of Leisen since the number of the great Duke Ellington is savagely cut, but that does not mean that it is not worth watching: the number 'Sweet Marihuana' with the girls to the topless chorus is a Blower spirit, given the impending production code, and the lovely Toby Wing (who unfortunately fed horrible lines and who plays the stupid blonde prototype), plays the chorion role for Jack Oakie, who is is concerned. The role of Carl Brisson is sweet like Melba Toast but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen is looking for new trays as a stereotypical idiotic detective. And try to spot Lucy in the choir. This notes a 7.0 as a curiosity. February 2010: Rethink: I recently reviewed the film and now I feel that I was wrong to criticize Busby Berkeley's lack of production. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production figures in the context of the plot. I still have huge problems with editing. Paramount, the city's most stylish studio, has faced enormous problems with the production code at the worst moment in its history, from the financial point of view, and has put all the means up to it. see also Search for Beauty 1934). A must for pre-code buffs.
