I've seen a lot of comedies and stand-up movies, but this one is so original, so fresh, you'll wonder why you've always walked in the video store. Murphy has some nice, exciting jokes but it's too funny to pass. If only each film could be so funny. it should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comic book genius in this movie and will make you say "this is the guy who made the painful Dr.!" He talks about the man with ice cream, the mothers who throw shoes, his aunt with a mustache, racism and everything you can imagine and those you can not. Please, if you ever see a comedy in your life, that's it, if only all movies could be delusional.
