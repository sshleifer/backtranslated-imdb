I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The scenario, though requiring some improvement, was quite good, especially in season 1. Season 2, however, became a monster show and lost the original charm of DA. Season 1 of the story was more interesting, a lighter side of life at Jam pony while a serious plot focused with manticore chasing the X series. I was looking forward to the new seasons, in fact I still am. I hope the guys at FOX and the DA production team realize that a lot of people are still waiting for DA to come back. Even after 2 years of cancellation, DA can succeed if we work on it properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should take up this challenge.
