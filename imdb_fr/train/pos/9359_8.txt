The feeling of this movie was amazing. The performance of Adam Sandler was very inspiring. As he played a very shaky and fragile character, he pushed his abilities to the extreme and really played the role. His character was really interesting. I can see myself reading the screenplay of this film and not being half as interested in Sandler's role as me. For someone who plays mainly comedy roles, he has achieved a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and his own input. I particularly liked the scene in which the characters of Adam and Don drove the motorized scooter into the city. I became familiar with the moment, as it seemed that Don was witnessing something that Adam was doing to get away from everything. With his video games, his music and many other things he did to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones seemed to escape his thoughts. This film is really worth seeing.
