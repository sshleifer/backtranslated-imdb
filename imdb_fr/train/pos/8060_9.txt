**** SPOILERS **** Powerful movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go so far as to sacrifice their best friends and family members without realizing the monsters they created by doing so. Until, as in the case of the bull Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen, it is too late. <br /> <br /> We are in 1922 and the climax of the Black & Tan revolt in Ireland against the mighty British Empire with the Tans, the British occupation troops, in search of the sought-after Irish Republican rebel, Frankie McPhillip, of Wallace Ford, were wanted for the murder of a soldier Briish. Gypo is a good, really the best. Fugitive McPhillip's friend is lucky not to have a job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, who has to turn towers in Dublin's hot area to pay her rent. <Br/> <br /> After Gypo, outraged, has looked for a possible John who wants to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, Katie, angry, tells Gyro not so bright that it prevents him to feed herself with the only banking asset she has, her body. Katie also tells Gypo that he should be aware of the reality and realize the desperate situation in which she finds herself. To tell Gypo, numb, that it would cost him only ten pounds to go to America and get out of poverty in Ireland. Gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip that he has just seen and announcing a £ 20 reward. That's enough money for Kaite and him to go to America. <br /> <br /> Gypo goes to a local pub pub in Dublin to get a free meal and is surprised to meet his friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie tells him that he has snuck into Dublin to see his mother, Mrs. McPhillip, and her sister Mary, Una O'Connor & Heather Angel, and if he can make sure everything is safe for him can go home and then leave for his Irish Republican. unit outside the city. <br /> <br /> All that Gypo can see in Frankie's face is the £ 20 reward for being turned into a cop! Without thinking again, after telling Frankie that everything was fine, Gypo secretly goes to the police and informs him of his friend, who was later killed in a shooting and shooting in his mother's house. <br /> <With the act accomplished, the police chief hands a £ 20 pound sterling, a little like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless Gypo who takes it and slips through the back door from the police station so that we can see it. . You can see on the face and actions of the police chief that he has nothing but contempt for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip. Even if he was wanted for murder and an enemy of the British empire. This is how traitors or informants are detained, even by those for whom they secretly work. <br /> <br /> Gypo turns out to be his worst enemy after betraying Frankie as his conscience takes control of his mind. Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend, Katie, pointing to him and implicating him in Frankie's betrayal and the death of the British authorities. The guilty mind of Gypo allows him to get drunk royally and gloriously, with the reward money, before forcing him to confess his crime to his colleagues in the Republican Irish Army, who had deemed the gypo almost dead in state drunk, the money was almost gone in his drinking party and prostitute. <br /> <br /> Whatever the good feelings, if it is possible, Gypo was completely demolished when, in an act of total despair, not to be shot at, it falsely implies an innocent man, Mulligan , Donald Meek, in his informational crime about his friend Frankie McPhillip. Which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by someone other than Gypo himself, who feels guilty. The dye is then molded as the straws are drawn. It's up to him to put the ball in Gypo's head for the last chapter of this heartbreaking and unforgettable plague of Crime & Punishment.
