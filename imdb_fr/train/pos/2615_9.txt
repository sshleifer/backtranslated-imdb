On the plane, flipping through the wide selection of movies, I came across Live! almost accidentally. Oh man! which choice. <br /> <br /> I vaguely remembered seeing the trailer over a year ago and I completely forgot about it, it was not expecting anything more than another absurd and ridiculous film about a stupid reality TV show. Now, I can easily say that it has been a hell of a walk. I do not remember the last time I was so excited, terrified. I do not know if it was the high altitude that played with my senses, but the suspense gradually grows in the film until reaching a climax where you can not turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and bite the nails' have had. <br /> <br /> You will first go through a personal moral assessment of your position vis-à-vis the justice of the show. You will think that "why can the human being be so vicious" and "why not after all?" Ask yourself if you would. Then ask about the candidates, their motivations and start to guess. You will then observe the competitor by pulling the trigger one by one and you will be passionate even if you know that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good director, with a cinematic experience that reminds you of old movies knew what would happen in the next scene but still wanted more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * two things I would have changed: <br /> <br /> - the casting of the candidates. The farmer really moved me and we should have had a little more like him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit silly, it seems like you do not care about some of the candidates. Although this could have been done on purpose, I think the public could have associated with the majority of candidates. - Rules of the game, a big problem: <br /> <br /> What happens if the 5th competitor does not die when he pulls the trigger? Do you seriously think that the last guy standing will pull the trigger and run himself !!! they should have given all the competitors a chance to live, that is to say: if the 5th is also white, no one will die. <br /> <br /> Curiously, I was not too embarrassed by these negative points, because I really had a good time. I would just like to have some popcorn with me!
