It was one of the best shows ever made for television. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists. Compulsive look. I was lucky to see this in the UK. I can not remember at all, they may have been wrong in the order of the episodes, but at least it was at least a regular hour every week. My girlfriend and I became addicted to the trailer, and none of us are big fans of the American series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we knew it was something special. We missed a few episodes and it made you sad and crazy for a week. Miss those lol. <br /> <br /> Excellent casting, superb acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black made an incredible performance for a child and Paige Turco was also at his best since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy, of course, as a longtime sheriff's teammate. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were confusing and confusing remarks, which I suppose would have been explained later and probably would have been in a later series. That made the end weak, and you could say they killed him. Made us go WHAT? Why did they do that with one of the best shows of all time? Shoot the exec.
