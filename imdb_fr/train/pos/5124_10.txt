It's a fantastic movie that I do not think deserves enough of a Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who loves a girl but has too much head to confess his feelings. Instead, he wants to engage in a mechanical bull because he thinks it will show his manhood. Although it was manufactured in 1980, it is still relevant. The soundtrack of country music is fantastic. 10/10
