I saw a special pre-screening of that today. I have to tell you that I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really did not expect that. I ended up enjoying it a little. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life tells the story of a widower with 3 daughters who spend a weekend with his family. In a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams but discovers that she is his brother's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This film is quite well done - soundtrack, cinematography and acting are all Top-notch elements, especially Steve Carell. My problem with this was mainly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mainly with the character of Dane Cook. We never really looked at the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I thought it might have helped a little to show what Dan's inner conflict was about being in love with the little girl. Dane's friend. Apart from that, Dan in Real Life is definitely a good movie, a nice break with all the horror and action movies we get this year.
