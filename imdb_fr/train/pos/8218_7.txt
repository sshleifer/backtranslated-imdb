As Harry Callahan stood up over the years, the inevitable story of "the old man with a flea on his shoulder" was finally to come on the scene. Callahan, sometimes looking fragile and out of place, his behavior was still unshakeable. Fortunately, this film took a long time to develop a different type of story, a story that could reinvent Dirty Harry and all that. Although the film failed, it was still a great addition to the series, although it was a little out of place in a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music.
