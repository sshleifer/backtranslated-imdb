I loved this film. I bought it as soon as I could find a copy. This film was so emotional and so real that I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I look at him, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Busy Phillip and how I would feel if the same thing had happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all high schools should show this movie. Maybe people will not want to do the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially those who were hit by a shooting in a school. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best movies of all time.
