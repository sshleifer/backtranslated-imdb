I will be honest with you. I was in high school when this sitcom aired for the first time on ABC and I did not think it would please me. But with John Ritter, I felt he had some potential and it was something else that I liked. The acting was awesome, not a lot of horrible lines from 2nd comedy, John Ritter always brings his A game when it comes to comedy. It was a great show to watch and I will explain why it was an excellent show. My dad never looks at sitcoms at all, he only looks at movies, sports and public order, he sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mom and I, and watched the series, I think, because John Ritter was present there. Honestly, I think this show would still be going on if John Ritter God rested his soul, I wish he did not die.
