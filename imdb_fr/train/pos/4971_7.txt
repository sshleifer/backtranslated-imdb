It's an absurd black comedy from Belgium. Shot perfectly in black and white, Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is in the shoes of Roger, the obsessive and angry family man who lives in a sullen Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, with his daughter Luise, visits road accidents to take pictures. He is also obsessed with winning a car by competing in a competition where the competitor has to break a record - and he decides that his son, Michael, must try to break the record of perpetual walking through a door - he engages even an overweight trainer train him. Michel disguises himself as Elvis and has a place on a radio show called "Cinema Lies", in which he describes mistakes in the films. Luise is friendly with her neighbor Felix, a pigeon fancier. Roger is a ruthless character who pushes Michel beyond the limit during the record attempt, almost resulting in his death. Throughout the film, surreal images like Magritte are scattered. It is undeniably charming and well worth your time.
