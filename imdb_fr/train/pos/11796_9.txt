Given the fact that it is based on the most infamous collective suicide incident in modern times, it would have been enough to draw the attention of this two-part 1980 film, designed for television. But the fact is, it's a superb recreation of the life of Reverend Jim Jones, who built a church into a virtual empire, and then encouraged him to disintegrate into a sullen cult in which a congressman and his entourage were murdered. 917 followers of the sect committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid sprayed with cyanide. <br /> <br /> Made with great taste but enough horror, unlike the CULT OF THE LATEST ADULT sadist, GUYANA TRAGEDY presents a cast of stars, including Ned Beatty (as representative Leo Ryan), Meg Foster Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powers Boothe (in his first big role) that really stands out like Jim Jones. He actually becomes the man, and his performance is captivating and scary. It is therefore not surprising that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years.
