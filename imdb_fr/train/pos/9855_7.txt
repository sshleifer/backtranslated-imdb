This is my first animated film in CGI that I have ever seen. Usually the look of other animated films made me reluctant to see them. Not the ice age. I wanted to see him when I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age was a sporadically funny film and fun to watch. The story is essentially an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, established 20,000 years ago. The visuals were great. All simply magnificent. Creating compelling information is one thing, but creating visually striking content is another. Ice Age is superb to watch with its stylized graphics. Blue Sky Studios is a company to watch in the future.
