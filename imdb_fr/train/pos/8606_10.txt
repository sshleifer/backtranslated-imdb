It seems that there is no medium on this film! Most of these events take place in a dream and, like most dreams, they are often stupid and illogical. It's also a great production with great songs and great performances, especially from our angel. <br /> <br /> Jeanette's impasse, her unconscious insults and various other pretenses when receiving her dreams are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and delight. At one point, she sings an excerpt of Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a pocket dog, for a strange reason), then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - extremely entertaining if you can get into the groove.
