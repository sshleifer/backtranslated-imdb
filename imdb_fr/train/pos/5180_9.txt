There is this private campground in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a site since 1965 and my two brothers now have one. <br /> <br /> (This has nothing to do with the movie, I'm here with me.) <br /> <br /> I spent the summers at Blueberry Hill from the age of five until the age of eighteen and it is for people like me to whom this film speaks: those for whom a group camp in the woods was, as my fiancee says, "the good and happy place ". If you have never experienced this lifestyle, the Indian summer will probably be lost for you; does not bother you. It's not fast, there are no quick cuts, the intrigues are not complicated at all, there are no explosions, the dramatic tension as it exists is light, it does not matter. There are no prominent actors, there are no quick nonsense just to show how intelligent the writers are (except perhaps Kimberley Williams' murderous sentence about how her fianc√© should not 'invade' This is not the least degree of this movie, nor is The Godfather a slasher movie just because there are so many things on the screen. <br /> <br /> But the Indian summer is the opposite of the Godfather If you have already experienced the lifestyle, watch this movie read more, do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a movie 9/10.
