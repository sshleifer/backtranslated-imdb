I saw this film for the first time as a young boy and I recently bought it on DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings a lot of depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a dedicated and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the office is closely linked to his family life, which is not quite rosy. His wife (an excellent portrait of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and they even broke up for a moment. Chip's best friend and colleague, Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton), is killed in a shootout. Chip's son, Mike, enlisted in the Marines during the Second World War. Nevertheless, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. And the music of Max Steiner says it all; loyalty, bravery and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country owes a lot to the gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and, of course, to J. Edgar Hoover. If Mr. Hoover's type of vigilance had been observed, we might have been spared on September 11, the resurgence of crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we have had to endure since his death.
