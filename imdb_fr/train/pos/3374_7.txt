"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing sci-fi movies of the 70s and remains very compelling, even by today's standards. Although defective and a bit dated, the apocalyptic contact and the environmental premise (typical of this era) always seem very disturbing and stimulating. The level of quality of this film surpasses the majority of contemporary SF movies due to the great strength of its casting and some intense sequences that I personally consider classics. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place for life, with overpopulation, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of all vital food items. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (very fit) plays the role of a police officer investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most prominent leaders. He comes across scandals and dark secrets. as a big surprise, the atmosphere is always very tense and strange. The riot sequence is truly grueling and undoubtedly one of the most gruesome moments of 1970s cinema. Edward G. Robinson is finally impressive in his last role and Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes ") plays an important supporting role (but too modest). This is science fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No whimsical spaceships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
