I lived in Rawlins when this film was shot and I was lucky enough to be able to work on it. In extra and with Eddie Surkin for special effects. It was fun to see everything going on behind the scenes, from Barbed's wire running to the electric chair through the guards' office. It was also very fun to meet all the actors from Viggo to Tiny. In addition, the door that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called "Disney Door" by the local population. If anyone is interested and is still in Rawlins, most movie sets are still in place and can be seen during the self-guided tour. It was a lot of fun working for and with R. Harlin and I was hoping to have the opportunity to do it again.
