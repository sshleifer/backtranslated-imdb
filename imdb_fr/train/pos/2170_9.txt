I think the creator (s) of the concept of this film deserve much more praise than those he probably received. This is certainly not an Oscar-winning film, but this film has left a lasting impression since I saw it for the first time in 1984 (at the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think it is (and I hope it is not) a spoiler, but: imagine acting on your impulses. Make the first thought that trots in your head, say the first words on your lips ... No constraint, no consciousness, nothing prevents you from saying or doing things that, as intelligent adults, we know that we should not really say or do it. If something happens, this film only scratches the surface - it does not go as far as it can. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with the idea of ​​redoing old "classics" to try to make money today, would not it be nice to see them redo old modest success film, for the pleasure of taking to the next level? A little further, or even exploring what the original team did not have or could not handle 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion. : o)
