I saw this film during an advanced projection and I found it excellent. <br /> <br /> I love you from New York is a real incarnation of a love story that explores intelligent, amusing and sometimes shocking situations around the most powerful emotion of the human race. <br /> <br /> The cast is huge, a real Oceans 11 with Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. They all give remarkable performances in one way or another. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there is one who is who administrators who weave stories in an intelligent and interesting way. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean -WOW! This film is not a romance or a romantic comedy, even if it is both romantic and funny. He also has stories and serious notes. But that's fine in my opinion. Go see it for yourself and answer my opinion, I want to hear what others have to say.
