I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train journeys, bike rides from the train station, soup kiosks and other typical scenes very well represented, certainly contributed to my own appreciation of this film that I really liked. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted with bright colors, but you do not have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. The tricks of the director Suo were for the most part subtle; I found it by highlighting the character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, making it sublime, a little bit artificial, but most of the director's tricks were so sweet that I was completely pulled apart and just danced with his characters. Or cried. Or laughed aloud. Wonderful. A +.
