This film is part of my favorite foreign films, the others being Amil√©e and My life as a dog. The similarities with these films as with so many great foreign films, are that it takes a slice of ordinary life and turns it into a deep and sincere lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who misses his social life and the rut of his married life sees a beautiful Japanese woman looking out the window of a dance studio. By the time he takes his train to pass, he is fascinated by it. But is it only by its beauty, by its distant glance or by a connection that they will both discover? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has memorable characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them in the world of dance. Breaking the traditional forms and stereotypes of Japanese society, they risk everything for happiness and find that the joy is not very far. It is one of those films that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.
