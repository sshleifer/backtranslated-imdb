I loved this film. It's a really inspiring film. It fills you with pride. This film is worth buying or buying. It should be everyone's home. Best movie I have seen in a long time. It's going to drive you crazy because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end, it's better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and lots of fun lines to keep you listening. I really like quotes. I use them all the time. They help me stay focused on what I want to do. It shows that anyone can realize their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It's a long film, but every time I look at it, I never notice it's as long as it is. I'm so absorbed that it's going so fast. I love that movie. I watch it whenever I can.
