Michael Kallio gives a compelling performance and epitomized by Eric Seaver, a troubled young man who has been horribly mistreated by his monstrous, abusive and alcoholic monster Barry (a truly scary portrait of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fiance (nicely portrayed by the charming Newberry Tracee) and a job of transcribing autopsy reports into a local morgue. Haunted by his lugubrious past, driven by the bald, radiating the demon Jack (a truly frightening Michael Michael Brandon), and overcome by the recent death of his mother, Eric goes deep inside himself and launches into a brutal killing party. Able directed by Kallio (who also wrote the tight and clever script), with a staging uniform and well done by an unnamed cast (Jeff Steiger is particularly good as a helpful keeper angel of Eric, Michael), rather rough, but overall a polished cinematography of George Lieber, characters true to reality, bursts of brutal, shocking and unshakably ferocious violence, a dismal and frightening partition of Dan Kolton, an uncompromising end, a sinister and grave position, Detroit, Mich. A gripping story that stays the course, this extremely powerful and powerful psychological horror thriller allows for an often captivating and disturbing vision. A real sleeper.
