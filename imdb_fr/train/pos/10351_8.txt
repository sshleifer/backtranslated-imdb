When the Chamberlain family camp near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby being dragged out of her tent by a dingo, then begins a test that no one should live. Because it seems that the dingo is not believed by the public or the press and everything turns into a circus. Lindy does not do anything, because she does not want to play in front of a jury or in a courtroom, she is only herself and it's a tough guy, so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there is a proof that did not reach light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-day Adventist minister, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It's good (or bad) to see that people are as prejudiced and stupid as they are in the United States, because the Australian public does not believe in history and the media just fuel the flames. Finally, Lindy is convicted and sent to jail for a lifetime of forced labor, but years later, missing evidence appears and is released, but not before the family's life is completely ruined. A heartbreaking story, very well done, a bit long but worth the detour. 8 out of 10
