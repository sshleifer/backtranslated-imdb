I saw it on a cable in the early 90s and I liked it. I never saw him until he appeared on the cable recently. Always find a good movie about Vietnam. You do not know why it's not rated better. I found everything about this compelling film. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam), I can talk about situations raised by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is more poignant now with our situation in Iraq. I wish it were offered on the cable more often for people to see. The human toll on our soldiers does not stay on the battlefield. He brought home for the rest of his life. And this film is one of the many films that bring her back home very hard. Excellent movie.
