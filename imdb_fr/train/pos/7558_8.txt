This episode of the first season is slightly controversial from a gender perspective. I imagine there would have been a lot of editing before it was over to appease the censors. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written and the staging is complemented by a refined acting game (Nicholas Lea debuts with X-Files but not as an agent Krycek but as a victim named Michael), I particularly enjoyed the construction and the end itself. <br /> <It's different but nice. Ignore the bad reviews you hear.
