Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Brand Smackdown. <br /> <br /> Results of the upcoming match ******** <br /> <We start the show with the match Inferno. Kane v. MVP. It was a good match. Nothing about the fight here. It was about the visuals. Overall, it was not bad. There were a few places close here with Kane approaching too close to the fire, but in the end, Kane won by beating MVP in the fire first. <br /> <br /> Nice opened the scoring. Let's go on. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new match for the team titles: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's go! <br /> <br /> Second match: four-way fatal match. It was a total carnage. Judging by three of the four teams present, chaos is expected to prevail. The spots were incredible. A total spot-fest. One point that Jeff chose Poetry in Motion and that London moved and that Jeff entered the rankings! Shortly after, Jeff is sitting on the top rope with two ladders nearby while MNM is going to kill Jeff, Matt makes the save and Jeff hits the "see-saw" shot at Joey Mercury! Mercury is injured. His eye is quickly closed and is open hard. Mercury is out of the game and Nitro is still there. He will fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor then take London and put it first in the ladder! Jeff climbs to scale and Nitro into a deadly area, dropkicks across the ladder to nail Jeff! Impressive! In the end, London and Kendrick keep the titles by team. What a game !!! <br /> <br /> It was crazy. I can not understand why the WWE has not announced this until now. The Buyrate would increase enormously. I am sure the reading quality will be good though. <br /> <br /> Mercury had a broken nose and lacerations to the eye. He is in the hospital now. I wish you a good recovery. <br /> <br /> It is impossible for anything else here to complete this project. <br /> <br /> Next step: the Miz v. Boogeyman. Will the Boogeyman ever fight? The Miz is bad too. After a mad crowd, it kills them. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit c. Chavo. It was a strong match. I liked that. Chavo hit a killer superplex at one point! Benoit also hit HUIT superb German! Benoit wins with the sniper. Good deal. <br /> <br /> Helms Title Championship Match v. Yang Cruiserweight. It was a good match. Unfortunately, stupid fans did not care about that. WHY? Helms and Yang have a lot of talent and have struggled well. I agree with JBL. He moved away from the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or to go out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy c. The Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. It was a slug party, with a few exceptions. At one point, Kennedy threw Taker off the stage. The stain was good. The reaction was disappointing. Taker, who fell on the hearse, won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. They both work hard. Yet, Kennedy needed this victory. Undertaker should have lost. Creative messed up again. <br /> <br /> A stupid thing about the diva is coming. I love women. Not that. At least Torrie was not there. It is refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Layla should have won. WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this as your break in the bathroom. Following. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena and Batista c. Finlay & Booker T. It was also a draw. Cena v. Finlay and Batista c. Booker were at the center of the concerns. Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was sloppy. Finlay hit Batista with a kneeling chair. Batista did not sell the shot and finished the match. Lame. Not at all a major event template. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder match was the main event here. It was enough money, right there. Some others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: A good PPV with the match on the ladder being the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show, it's not convincing enough. Smackdown must stop letting Cena sign up. Let Smackdown stand on both their legs. This show proves that Smackdown can.
