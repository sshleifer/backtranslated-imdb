It was an excellent piece for the puppet series because this film showed all series, from one to seven. And it was about a woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would not never guessed that the puppets would be painful. In addition, he showed some of the series of puppet masters that I had not seen and that I did not see so well as the second part. He showed a torch look that can transform things and humans, which is cool, and showed the return of the puppet master of the first part. He also showed that small extraterrestrials from part 4 was also cool, he showed other people episodes that could be good for them and that's right. So, thanks to this Puppet Master is going to be a great success.
