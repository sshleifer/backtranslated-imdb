Kubrick demonstrates once again his astonishing ability to create a perfect mood for a movie. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, it creates a scary and disturbing tone that permeates the entire film and gives me chills from the beginning. It's really this flawless atmosphere that makes The Shining the masterpiece he is, in my eyes. Of course, it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. A frightfully authentic representation of a mad mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look beyond these two when the rest of the movie is so brilliant. In addition, he presents the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
