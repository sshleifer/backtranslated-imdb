If you like science fiction, monsters and legends, then you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> The special effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park came to the big screen years ago. Although acting is a bit less desirable, the scenario and the effects compensate it adequately. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see this at the movie theater on a movie screen instead of our 42 inch screen TV. <br /> <br /> If you like non-stop action, great graphics and the taste of myth and history, you have to see this movie!
