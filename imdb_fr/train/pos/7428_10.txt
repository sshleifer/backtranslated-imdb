I swear that when I saw this movie for the first time, I cried! A star is born is the film that lets you know what love really looks like despite the obstacles that John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience losing such love at the end of the film. Streisand and Kristofferson have such chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With one more look at you / Look closely now, it's pure magic! This film made the Evergreen song one of my favorite songs and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also like 70s fashion (except Streisand's Afro, plus it's a beauty). A star is born is my favorite movie number one. This film is a pleasure to watch and breaks the heart at the end.
