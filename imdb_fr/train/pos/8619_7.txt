I would first say that in a way I remember seeing this film in my early childhood, I could not read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you can not at least partially suspend the skepticism of your adult and kiss your seventh inside your old, you may want to avoid this movie. That being said, after watching the restored version of 137 minutes on DVD, I must say that I liked it, but not as much as when I was seven (I remembered the end). <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film deserve to be criticized. The first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes both have very comical moments, my favorite being the contrast between the scenes played in the last 10 minutes and the curious choice of the accompanying music (listen to the lyrics). <br /> <br /> For an action film, the personal stories of some soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad are the subject of special attention as the tension of their journey through time makes havoc. At the end of the movie, I decided it was a good thing, whereas seven hours later I thought the relationship between them was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> For an action movie, there is also a lot of bloody and rewarding action. , especially some epic battle scenes between the platoon and the hordes of Shogun-era warriors. The directors of the film have made sure that as many people as possible are deadly and, let's be honest, humorous. I thought it was a beautiful aspect of the movie when I was a kid and I'm not ashamed to say that I still do it. <br /> <br /> I also like the fact that modern day soldiers in general do not 'do not pass the film to walk on egg shells trying to avoid changing the space-time continuum: they have heavy machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they are resolutely in the process of appropriating feudal Japan. That's what I'd like to think that any dynamic IMDb user would do in his boots. <br /> <br /> In short, films that are worth watching are causing the viewer to regret that there are no more films made with the same principle, and at the same time offers some hints heavy as to why a movie like GI Samurai is so unique.
