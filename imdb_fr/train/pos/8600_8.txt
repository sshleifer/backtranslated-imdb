My part hesitated about what this movie had to offer. For starters, the casting did not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland had already played very well in "24" and the preview did not seem to challenge him or the audience. Eva Longoria seemed out of place and the rest did not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally came to an end, I was not completely unhappy, because I had already seen a decent thriller that could have been much better, The officials would have taken a little more attention gaps in storytelling and paid more attention to character development. We have seen such threats before, making the main conflict much more difficult for the perpetrators. As an audience, we do not want to be in the same story again. We want to see something different, be delighted and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this casting. From the delightful first lady of Kim Basinger. She wears herself with enough grace and sex appeal to make the party memorable. Michael Douglas has already been and has already done so. Unfortunately, the president is far from worrying about his fate. Sutherland reiterates his "24" tough-guy approach with enough power to make him big enough for the big screen, and Eva is doing a fair job as a newcomer. <br /> <br /> Do not expect as many twists and fireworks as some of the established classics ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride, whatever it is. Its good.
