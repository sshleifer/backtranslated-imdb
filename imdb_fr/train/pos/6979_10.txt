This is a true drama inspired by characters and history, at a level that shames most of what we see on television on television. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the beginning. Do not be put off if you're not crazy about science fiction (like me ...) This could happen on Earth, the fact that it's in another galaxy makes the show more interesting. there are no spaceships or laser cannons (none for the moment, anyway). So far, I have seen until s01 e04 and I am trapped and I wonder what will happen because there are so many possibilities. <br /> <br /> The actors play roles with pasion. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show is really unique, whether you look at BSG or not, in fact, they are quite different. I've read some negative reviews of science fiction geeks who were expecting fewer dramas and more extraterrestrials and ray guns, etc., but I would say they are ignored. <br /> <br /> It's a really good start to a show. Hopefully they will not see it after one or two seasons as they usually do with good shows these days.
