Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to a show with him. She agrees on the condition that they do not share any information about each other - not even their names. Sometimes these are the best types of dates. However, on his return to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. Her alibi is the mysterious woman but no one remembers seeing her and, as a result, Scott is sentenced to death for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and seeks to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind Kansas' attempts to find the truth. We follow her through some memorable scenes, such as her pursuit of the bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the claustrophobic place where Cliff the thresher (Elisha Cook Jr) takes her to spend time with her, drink and dance while he train with his friends. . It's such a blatant portrayal of sexual desire that it's part of the movie, because everyone is sweating intensely and rhythmically throughout the stage. Ella Raines plays the main female role and Thomas Gomez is a friendly policeman. Alan Curtis started well as a confused and innocent man, but once stopped, his rendition turned to the left and he became completely unpleasant in Kansas for no reason. God knows why she stayed by her side. <br /> <br /> The movie does not stop you from guessing who the murderer is, as we know from half the movie, but it does not matter. In fact, it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story, as we go to Kansas to find out what's going on, and then to get the hell out of it! It's a good movie with beautiful scenes but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I never like it in anything I see it in .... someone hands me a tie .. ...
