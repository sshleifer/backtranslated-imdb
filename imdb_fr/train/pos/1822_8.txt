An unforgettable masterpiece by the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, it was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. I remember it very well since my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark, a dog that has escaped the pound, gets killed by an old friend, ends up in heaven and comes back. But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphan who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a little scary unlike other cartoons, like Charlie's dream sequence, but everything else was fine and the songs were just right. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love this guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws Revenge, may God rest her soul with peace, she did not deserve to die, but she is now in paradise, all good people go to heaven. Overall, it's a very good animated film, a Don Bluth classic enough to shame the anime and Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have the original video, you will find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, I have to like this guy, ahehehe.
