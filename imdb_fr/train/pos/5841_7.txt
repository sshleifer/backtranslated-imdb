The story of peace-loving peasants and townspeople struggling for land, water, law and respect, as well as the respect and ultimate subjugation of long-standing cattle interests and their leased weapons have been better explained in previous movies (Shane) and probably later well. There are good action scenes and the general presentation of the story, except for a disappointing end, is well executed. Law and public order and religion have taken root in the city, but the old order of cattle rides, cowboys and armed bandits still exists. The shock of both occurs in a well-staged ambush scene where city dwellers climb right into a trap. Granger, a veteran, plays the guy who is fled by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun.
