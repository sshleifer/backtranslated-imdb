An extra is called to play a general in a film about the Russian revolution. However, it is not an extra ordinary. It is about Serguis Alexander, former general commander of the Russian armies, who must now relive the same scene in which he lived a professional and personal tragedy, to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and humiliated by Alexander. The moment may have come for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate fight. It is a powerful film with a meticulous direction of Von Sternberg, providing the greatest irony in the character of Alexander in every way possible. Jannings earned his Oscar for the role with a very moving performance that played the general at his peak and in his deepest valley. Powell brings grim support to the director to revenge and Brent is perfect in his role with his face and movements showing as much expression as Jannings' love. All around the shine. Note, 10.
