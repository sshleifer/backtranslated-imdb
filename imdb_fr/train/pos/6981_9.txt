For all enemies: to condemn a television series with an episode is to judge an entire book after reading the first pages. That being said, I was a big fan of BSG, I thought it was one of the best TV series (and not just science fiction). But it was time for this to end and the story move forward. I liked the epilogue "The Plan" of the GRB, but he raised as many new questions as he answered me. I was looking forward to "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping he would not try to be another GSO, and I was happy that "Caprica" ​​was something different, and I personally found the story exciting, in a different way from inflamed space battles, explosions and sci-fi special effects (do not get me wrong, I like this thing too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances and Alessandra was just wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
