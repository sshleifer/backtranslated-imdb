I love playing football and I found this movie awesome because it contained a lot of football. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad he won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good, as was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers played well as coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football, but her parents want her to learn how to cook and how to get married. When Jazz starts playing secretly for a football team, she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is his coach. When her parents discover that there are problems and her father lets her play the big wedding match of her sister Pinky (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents realize how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.
