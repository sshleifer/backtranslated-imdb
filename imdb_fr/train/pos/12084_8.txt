My name, Julia Ross refers to an English tradition that things are not what they seem to be - The Lady Vanishes by Hitchcock is an example. Julia Ross (Nina Foch), unemployed, finds a dream job in a new job agency in London, whose sinister representative seems very anxious to know if she has parents alive or a boyfriend. After getting to work, she wakes up (being drugged) in a vast Manderley-like pile on the Cornwall coast, supposed to be George Macready's silly wife, with alarming interest in knives and picks ice cream. . Her adorable and empowering mother is the irresistible Dame May Whitty (this time a model of effervescent efficiency on the other side of the good against the evil she occupied in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmarish vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically; we know what's going on but are powerless to tell poor Julia. Curiously, this film is regularly given a place of honor as one of the first (and very little British) black films. I think this is closer to the Gothic tradition of the old black house than the American tradition of wet cobblestones and urban corruption; it does, however, reflect a more modern and psychoanalytic spirit. Whatever you call it, it remains an extremely satisfying thriller.
