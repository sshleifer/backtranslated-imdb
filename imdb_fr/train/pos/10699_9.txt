When I saw Birthday Girl, I liked it so much that I started to see all the Nicole Kidman films that I could, but I found them all disappointed. I suppose that if the presence of a given star generally guarantees a certain level of quality thanks to its artistic control, with Nicole Kidman, the influence that it exerts affects the smooth running of the film - in my humble opinion. Thus, for example, Dogville even deprives the viewer of any visual element that may be detrimental to the existential insight she is hammering home, or to other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of the attention of any other nobody, or other animal causes of Kidman. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and she does a very good job. I do not know how or who could hold it, but apparently it worked. The way the film portrays its openness despite its resistance touches the heart of what makes a woman a woman. And therefore, what makes the most desperate hopes of a man marginally attainable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that the male lead turns from milquetoast clerk into a macho man in the space of a movie is like a fantasy of expansion of the male ego, but its transformation is sufficiently credible. It is not artificially artificial, as it would be in a movie designed to reinforce the masculine ego. Instead, it accurately records the necessary growth resulting from the unique circumstances of the movies. <br /> <br /> The way the criminals are described is perfectly charming, apart from their criminal mission. His band has a mixed brotherhood that is foreign to American culture. And although they are his adversaries, they are never really his enemy. In fact, they teach him to be competitive. <br /> <br /> I am really amazed at Kidman's ability to physically appear in Russian. I wondered if her ancestors were Russian, but none of her photos I examined showed any trace of them. Maybe it's just makeup but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that she will soon overthrow her so that she can make another great movie. Despite my free research on Mrs. Kidman, the message is that it is a superior film in every respect and probably the role of a life.
