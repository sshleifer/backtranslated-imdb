I love this show. Period. In fact, I have not been watching for a very long time, probably six months or so, but now it's my favorite show and it will probably be for a long time. I like all the characters except that I do not really like Donna. I do not really know why. I just ... do not find it funny, and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Apart from her, I find the rest of the cast very well. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played the parents of Erics, were extremely entertaining. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I did not hate the 8th season. I always look at it and it makes me laugh. But, if you compare it to previous season's shows, it's ... not good. Randy is horrible. The final was ok, nothing amazing, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after the departure of Ashton and Topher, but hey. I have the fourth season on DVD and one day, I hope to have the eight seasons on DVD. In my opinion, some of his most hilarious episodes have been "Dine & Dash", "Grandmas Dead", "Red & Stacey" and "Streaking", but I love all the episodes I've seen so far. , who are for the most part, I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would recommend it without hesitation. =]
