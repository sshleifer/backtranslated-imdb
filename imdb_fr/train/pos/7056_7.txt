The rest of Cinderella's ever-popular story reminded me a bit of what they did with one of The Beauty and the Beast's movies. <br /> <br /> All right, mice are cute (I love Gus, he's so cute!) And Lucifer is awesome (as usual). I also liked some of the most recent characters (Pom Pom was adorable and I loved Prudence). Still, the scenario was limited, but still very cute. So, I vote 7/10.
