My girlfriend and I have a thing for robots. So I try to look for movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Large. They fought each other, the fate of the nations being at stake. It's really cool. You must forgive this film its many shortcomings and simply try to appreciate what the director and his team of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with a budget obviously reduced. It is very difficult not to like this movie. Because of these big robots. They looked like Transformers and fought like professional wrestlers! This made my girlfriend smile. And that's enough for me. It is also worth mentioning the famous actor Paul Koslo: as a Russian maniac, it is without mercy to his helpless opponents after surrendering or complaining that their proximity to him in a bar caused his taste vodka "like blood" (line that he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-Bela Lugosi accent) he is clearly making a ball and the film benefits enormously every time he is on the screen. It's a nice little movie that deserves its cult reputation.
