Pushing Daisies is really a landmark in television as an art form. Everything seems to pay tribute to Amelie and Tim Burton, but in a world where new ideas are rare, this show will guarantee that you do not worry about whether it's fresh or not. It's just great. <br /> <br /> I've been fascinated since the beginning, intelligent writing, staging and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since The Shield and The Wire (ok, no quite good comparisons but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that there is no comparison on TV). <br /> <br /> Really addictive and an absolute pleasure. Perhaps as one of the Piemakers pies that are mentioned so temptingly.
