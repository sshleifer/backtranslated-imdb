One of the best kung-fu movies, but not as perfect as I had hoped given the rave reviews. The film starts pretty well, the jokes are quite visual, they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than we think at the time) and make the dialogue sequences without combat (for a kung movie -Fu, it's a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action films, which were still period pieces or cop dramas (as a result of Jackie Chan's Police Story I), Pedicab Driver gives us a glimpse of contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the last third of the film, the tragedy of dark melodrama plunges me into a tragedy that I thought was useless. <br /> <br /> The action is generally good, staging a duel between Sammo Kar-Leung Lau, the two stars of Shaw Brothers, then a fight in the end with this big guy who always plays the villain Jet Li. There's only 20 minutes of fighting here, which is normal, but what bothers me is the obvious acceleration of the camera frames. I understand that they have to film at half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth montages and then there is that. It really takes a fight when it is obvious that the images have been ruined. <br /> <br /> That said, if you like kung-fu movies, my opinion here will not dissuade you, and if you do not, you've just lost 2 minutes of your life reading this.
