Yes, I call it a perfect movie. Not a boring second, a fantastic cast of little-known actresses and actors, a wide variety of well-defined characters, all with understandable patterns that I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photos, soundtrack, a smart and harmonious scenography and an engaging and effective story. It's one of those high-quality images that all Hollywood pride should be based on, a goal that everyone should strive to achieve. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply beautiful. There was nothing this actress could do, and she was always sweet on the melodramatic side. No hysterical fits with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this film confirmed my opinion. Always as hard as nails and at the same time conveying real feelings. It is fair to say that she has also had many good roles in her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits very well in this movie. It's about desires, human desires, I think everyone can understand. In fact, no one seems to bother in this movie, all the characters act impulsively, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone. The sad fact that this most often leads to complications is the dramatic content in which I will not go here. I liked what this film has to say about youth, maturity and the need to compromise. The film I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. It creates a similar atmosphere of Small Town America idealized and at the same time caricatured. The story has some similarity to Fritz Lang's much harder film, Clash by Night, made a year earlier, in which Stanywck plays the lead role. I can also recommend it.
