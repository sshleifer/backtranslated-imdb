I find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie! Obviously, this movie was not that bad, otherwise people would not even want to talk about it. Personally, I enjoyed this film immensely and I always do it! I guess this film is not suitable for everyone, but it certainly touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> For those who think that this movie is "overrated" or "over-excited" ... well, we only have to thank the movie public! lol * You see, it's not the CRITICS / the authors of articles that make a film "HUGE" or a "HIT" with the general public. People make the movie a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was impressed. Let's face it, a film like this had never been shot before. At least, not with the kind of special effects needed to capture the essence of the sinking ship. This film is so precise that even James Cameron programmed the sinking of the ship into the film with the REAL sinking of that fateful day of April 1912. Even the silverware for the sake of good was equal! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break, you guys! Critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this film really came out and people started to hear from WORD OF MOUTH (which is the best form of advertising you have), it was a good movie / good to see, then everyone began to pour in mass to see this movie. ... not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I would not really say that this movie was "overhyped" ... at least not like the buildup for the reloaded MATRIX or the HULK is "overhyped". Ha! Critics did not even think that the Titanic would earn enough money to cover the gigantic Cameron film budget needed to make this gigantic movie. However, the movies money took care of this 200 million budget and MUCH more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this movie might not be for everyone. Do not say that this movie just fears because of romance! It's the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Do not like a movie just because there is romance! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it ... the real star of the movie was neither Leo nor Kate ... it was this GIGANTIC ship! I think everyone involved, including DiCaprio and Winslet, did a good job. It's not their best job (I've seen a lot better of both), but it was not the worst I've seen on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
