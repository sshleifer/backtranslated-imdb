I have seen this film many times and I must tell you that I enjoyed it every time. In my opinion, this is Belushi's film. Belushi and Lovitz are so friendly and identifiable with the common man that you can not help but get involved once you start looking. The film has a wonderful cast of stars, some were already big and others were just starting. It's presented as a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This film teaches you that life is not always so bad after all. Sometimes you just look at things from a different angle to fully appreciate what you already have. When you finish watching, you will appreciate what you have a lot more and you will smile too. You can not ask for much more than a movie in my opinion, not to mention it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest. Very underrated movie here, guys. <br /> <br /> Note from me: 10 I'm out !!!
