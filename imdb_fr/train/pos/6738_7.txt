Where the Sidewalk Ends is a very good black police movie and is well filmed in black and white and also in filming. <br /> <br /> A copper accidentally kills a suspect type of murder and to protect himself, he conceals that and blames it on another person he does not like, who has committed many crimes in the past. But towards the end, he admits but not before falling in love with a woman he meets, who is the love of the person he killed ... <br /> <br /> The cast includes Dana Andrews (While the City Sleeps), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost, and Mrs. Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond the Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Mante Death). Good parties of all. <br /> <br /> Where the sidewalk ends is worth the trip if you're lucky. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
