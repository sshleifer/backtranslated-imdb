I had never heard of this film before having met by chance while browsing IMDB. I saw that he had received many frightful reviews containing very colorful expletives on the stench. Of course, that meant I had to see him. I was pleasantly surprised because Whipped is rather a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and laughed more than in many of Hollywood's acclaimed fluff comedies. It is an independent film and as such depicts its subject (sex and encounters) without the usual Hollywood devices. I distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will depend a lot on their experience of life. If you have never been too busy or partying, you will not get this movie because you have not met people like these characters. If you did, you will recognize many of the situations described here in a comic way. The end was also good because it did not portray women as unreal, helpless virgin romantics opposed to many Hollywood films.
