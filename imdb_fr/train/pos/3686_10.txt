Diane and I saw this fabulous film today at Fremantle and we agreed that among the pastiche movies, he was head and shoulders above the rest. I say that because we were fascinated by the brief five to ten minute segment that made up the film and by the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and that this theme was of course love under all its forms. <Br /> <br /> Apparently, the film took place in the various districts of Paris, giving a particular flavor to each segment. Having been to Paris only several times, I did not know enough place to easily recognize the place but I am sure that Europeans and especially the French could easily recognize the place. In any case, the viewer is immediately drawn into each story because of the excellence of its production, so that the location of this city fades significantly. <br /> <br /> The film advances quickly and lets the viewer absorb a screenplay while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic like Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and provocative and sweet as in most lives without the media strip that buries so much of the beauty of life under the most dung heap just close to sell, sell. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with your entourage and let this magical little film swim you like a spa treatment. When you leave, I guess you will feel renewed.
