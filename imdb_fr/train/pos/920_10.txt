This cute animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is the bald guy and slightly corpulent comics who never talks. <br /> <br /> Well, he's talking here! <br /> <br /> He wants to buy a puppy at Betty Boop's pet shop, and when left alone, hilarious hijinks ensue. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about pets, Henry fights with birds and a monkey, but everything goes well at the end.
