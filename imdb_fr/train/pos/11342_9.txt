I watched Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 years old. It was just after Bay City Rollers. I saw him arrive on Family Channel one day and I filmed it for my three year old daughter. I had forgotten everything I had loved, the magic flute, the zoom broom, the Witcheepoo makeup. <br /> <br /> This show is resolutely low tech. The mayor is surely a precedent for Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with wide eyes. But kids love this stuff. They would rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of a cutting-edge computer animation. There is a burlesque (sweet), but no adult theme like sex or death, and the kids accept Jimmy's ploys. The children think it would be nice to carry a bag of smoke and convince someone that their house was on fire, and I loved the fact that every time my daughter saw a throw in the sky, she thought that Witchypoo was flying above his head. The music is old, but you get used to it and my daughter really loved it. She used to sing "different, it's hard, different, it's lonely" in the car. My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and it's still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in preparation. I really hope they will try to keep the old flavor and will do nothing more than computer-animated characters, etc. I think a whole new generation would like Pufnstuf.
