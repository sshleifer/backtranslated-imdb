For those who say that this film deserves anything below the flawless grace it has shown, I do not agree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this film. Please consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage it took to shoot this film is particularly remarkable. We find that the two brothers are separated when this moment has arrived. They continue to document the bravest of the bravest without knowing about their safety and that of everyone. Judge if it is more noble to shoot a video of this tragedy or save lives as these extraordinary firefighters did, it's up to me to answer. I just know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other. <br /> <br /> I submit an enthusiastic heart of 10. That's why the art of filming was created! Capture the natural emotion that real life offers. You can keep your bric-a-brac kung-fu. The romance is cute. The action will never reach this level. This film, 9/11, will be timeless in the sense that he did not boast. He did not have a preview. He did not have all the blatant vanities that the lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare. He had class, composure, substance and a memory of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world. He talked about things that are inevitable in the eye of the camera. Please consider this film, as it proclaims itself, a moving tribute to all those who have fallen because of the free and beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give anything less to a film that shows embellishes, the natural courage of real people acting in unreal times. I love "The Godfather" but "9/11" is forever a different genre of film because it is now a different kind of world. It's art without question or question. <br /> <br /> jf
