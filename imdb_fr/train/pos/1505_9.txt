"The House That Dripped Blood" is one of the best anthology films of this era. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> On the trail of a missing star, Inspector Holloway, (John Bennett) notes that the last reported sighting occurred in a large manor house in the countryside. During his research in the house, he tells four different stories about former residents of the house. <br /> <br /> The good story (s): Method to get to murder in the mysterious mansion to get some peace Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Joanna Dunham) are delighted with the story that unfolds around a serial strangler named Dominic. After a series of accidents and strange experiences in the house, Charles begins to believe that his creation has come to life and haunts him and his wife. Probably one of the best entries in the movie, it's easily the scariest. The atmosphere here is what sets it apart. The scenes with the fictional character are really scary, the mystery around it is really effective and there is always a moment of classic slip. The classic moment is the killing in the psychiatrist's office, an absolute record for goose bumps. Accompanying accumulation, with the creaks, quick flashes of a mysterious being, and thunder and lightning in the background work well for the sake of it. <br /> <br /> candy for candy a new home, widower John Reid (Christopher Lee), hires a former teacher, Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter), for her daughter Jane (Chloe Franks), then he is on a business trip. Ann gradually begins to reveal a dark secret of Jane's past, which John vehemently denies. When she learns the true nature of what happened, it's a lot more shocking than she might have thought possible. With the pure and simple plot and the biggest story bounce, it's a pretty nice entry. The mystery of the family is marvelously played, with small amounts of clues accumulated here and there, and the final revelation is downright agonizing. This part alone is the main reason why it works, and Lee does not hurt him either. <br /> <br /> The Bad Story (s): Waxwork-Tortured by memories of his lost love, Phillip Grayson (Peter Cushing) and his friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) both get caught up in the statue of a woman kept in a wax museum; as this statue resumes their life, they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts them both. There is a clever premise here, and that provides an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which is always terrifying. This is no exception, and it looks mysterious, thanks to the fluorescent lighting of the sculptures. A sequence of dreams provides a great moment of suspense, but what ends up killing it is the slow pace. It takes a long time for the events to unfold and most of the time is spent on the exhibition. It also creates a shock that ends at a mile and a half. Those who really lower this one a bit. If the turn had been changed, the rest would be acceptable. <br /> <br /> Horror movie actor Cloak-Veteran Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) dissatisfied with the lack of realism on the set of his new film, goes off to buy a new vampire coat in a specialized store. The cape quickly turns him into a vampire, going crazy on set with co-star Carla (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampiric acts at home. Not convinced that the coat is the cause, he does everything in his power to prove that it's just in his imagination. This has a fairly decent premise, and there are plenty of opportunities for decent fears, but several factors are involved. First of all, it's too awkward for his good. The plot at the end is a perfect example, which is so exaggerated that it's not really a shock, but that just looks stupid. There are so few scaring or scaring scenes that you should not be bored. It is the weakest of the film. <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: An absolutely decent omnibus movie, some small problems are scattered in each of the stories that make this film less perfect but always very watched. Highly recommended for fans of similar films of the time or British horror movies. <br /> <br /> The day's review-PG-13: Violence
