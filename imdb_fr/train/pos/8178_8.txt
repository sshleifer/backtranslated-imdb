It's not that many movies have really exploited the fear of going to the dentist like many people. Members of the profession have real intimidating instruments. Tell authors Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon, and Charles Finch to have the most shock when they snuggle into their seats. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen, in a nicely nuanced performance, is Alan Feinstone, a dedicated dentist whose train quickly jumps tracks. Obsessive-compulsive, he begins to dwell on thoughts of decay, imagining it even where there is none, and also equating decay with the corruption of society in general. After seeing his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) talk to their pool boy, he decides to punish her. At the same time, he is under the pressure of a smart I.R.S. the agent (Earl Boen, better known as Dr. Silberman of the "Terminator" franchise) to serve in exchange for the agent's retention regarding Feinstone's financial affairs. Feinstone begins to perceive everyone around him as discouraged in one way or another and he launches into a series of murders as police detective Gibbs (the always-welcome Ken Foree) follows his path. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna has a lot of fun with the script. This creates gory scenes that are truly nasty and remarkably entertaining, generating as much sympathy for the victims as the public. The script gives the Feinstone character some refined lines of dialogue and is generally sneaky and amusing, with high doses of dark humor (like Feinstone telling a victim to "get rid of the tongue!"). Brooke and the I.R.S. agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. The makeup effects are for the most part very good. And the film does a great job of keeping up momentum, as Feinstone, with his relentless quest for perfection, switches in record time from respected professional to a frenzied killer. <br /> <br /> Foree, always cool and fun to watch. , is rather wasted in a standard detective role, but it's nice to see Boen fully play his slimeball role. Hoffman and Christa Sauls provide eye treats that are very appealing. And a pre-fame, Mark Ruffalo, can be seen in a small supportive role. But it's quite the Bernsen show that's sticking its teeth (forgive me for using that expression) in its leading role with absolute conviction. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is one of the most original and original horror films of interest for the 90s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
