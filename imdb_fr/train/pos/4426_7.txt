I'm happy to have seen this movie after watching other director's films in the past. I thought the production values ​​were excellent, like the costumes and decors of the bridge. It was interesting to see how mind and demon concepts were handled. <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the other comments on the fight scenes. They were sometimes difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> Finally, a moral tale. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers thought of the movie. This is a film that I would like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like those where Benkai and the Prince were arguing on a "psychic" plane were very successful. <br /> <br /> I came out of the cinema thinking about what happened here. Intense.
