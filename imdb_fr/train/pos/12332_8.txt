Having seen the film several times in horror film marathons, I think it is a humorous parody that contrasts with most of its reference. <br /> <br /> Although the topics covered are crisp and captivating for current viewers, this is by no means a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although being a student film gives little excuse, the proof is that it seems to have been carefully crafted on a limited or non-existent budget. As another reviewer noted, it's less than ten minutes, which is ample enough to clean the audience's palace with a toast of joy, sit back and flip through the movie without saying anything. <br /> <br /> I think this short film should be appreciated as an appetizer for the reference of the title and that the viewer should relax and ride with.
