Okay. This has been a favorite since the age of 14. Certainly, I do not look at it several times a year, but ... It's not a movie for an older generation that wants a deeper meaning or a brilliant message. This movie is fun. It's pretty dated, almost gone, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's amazing. If you want to be seduced by a 90s breakfast at Tiffany, to attend the raves of the 90s or to like Parker, this film is for you. Otherwise, do not bother.
