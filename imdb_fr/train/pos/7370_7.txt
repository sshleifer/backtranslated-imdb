Some have compared this film to Deliverance. I believe that mice and men are more appropriate. Heaton, our main man, loves Spike. It does not matter if it's a sexual love. That's why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs him They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as their only connection to humanity. The set, the scenario and the minimal distribution are added to a beautiful film. Frankly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But I was worried about what the filmmaker did with them. He did well with them. I spent some time wondering how the ending would look like Of Mice and Men. The soundtrack and the cinematography were fascinating and intriguing.
