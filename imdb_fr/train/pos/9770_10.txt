This film is excellent and I would recommend renting it to anyone who owns the local video store. Or, better yet, you can buy it because it is likely that you will look at it again and again. I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and it was great at the time. But after seeing him again yesterday, I found him incredible. <br /> <br /> A good mix of comedy (although not as awesome as "Mr. Magoo" - another of my favorites) and action. It deserves 10/10 and I hope they will soon have a sequel (fingers crossed). If you are babysitting or need to take care of young children for anything, then I would recommend renting this movie because it will be entertained for hours :).
