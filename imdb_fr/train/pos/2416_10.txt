Yes, it's a pretty ridiculous film, so if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget about it ...... but if you like John Candy's humor, it's a must. We lost John Candy before he did enough of his big comedy and he's only better in one movie: Planes, Trains, & Automobiles (with Steve Martin). Eugene Levy's excellent supporting performance, perhaps his best work of all time under the pseudonym Sal DiPasquale. Also well played by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle. You must see this obscure and exhausted movie if you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy.
