"The scorpion tail affair" contains all the elements necessary for the realization of an effective giallo film. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow goes to Greece for payment, but a series of horrific murders follow her. There are many suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. Director Martino advances the story at a steady pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the murderer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your vice is a closed room and I only have the key" and "Who saw her die?") Is a stunning heroine. This is one of Martino's best films.
