After a while, I got used to reading comments on these movies that do not reflect my experience. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. He was an inflexible villain, a villain without excuses. For me, it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his wickedness was not somehow diminished. <br /> <br /> The kid who played Aryan was probably above his head with this casting. There, I think the director might have done better. But, to be honest, Shernaz Patel was the best part of this movie. She is an unknown heroine, a real veteran who is overqualified for all the roles that are offered to her. But I must say that I really appreciated her contribution when she played Virendra Sahi's wife. It can be given little to do, but it does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she went through the heads of most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So, if you're used to just Bollywood, you will not get much from this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, it might give you some of what you missed.
