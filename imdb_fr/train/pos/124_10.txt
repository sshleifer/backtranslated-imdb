* Contains spoilers because I have to describe some cinematic techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. The use of hues in some scenes gives the impression of an old photo coming to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a background screen. For example, in a scene, Leopold calls his wife and it is projected behind him rather than on a split screen. His face is huge in the back and Leo's in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses of this is when young boys kill the Ravenstein on the train, a scene shot in an almost political style. , with close-ups of the face. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense, constant style associated with the red spray to transmit tons of horror without a lot of gore. Same thing for the scene where Katharina found her father dead in the bathtub ... we only see the red water on the side. That's one of the things I like in Von Trier, its euphemism of horror, which makes it even more scary. <br /> <br /> The use of the text in the film was unique, as when Leo's character was pushed by the word, "werewolf". I have never seen anything like it in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this film has been well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle. This evokes the sneers that I learned from his role in the Kingdom (Riget.). This humor makes easier the intrigue of the absurd anal remanence of the conductors in the terrible context of the Second World War and all the chaos. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator tries to maintain normality at the end of the first part when everything goes crazy. This shows that some people are really unaware of the terrible things around them. However, some people, like Leo, are listening, but do not do anything positive. <br /> <br /> The voiceover, brilliantly performed by Max von Sydow, is also fun. It takes you into the story and makes you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes a scary place. <br /> <br /> The film shows that one is a coward if one does not choose side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where the character of Bjork does not speak for herself and ends up being her own destruction. In fact, at one point, Von Trier seemed anti-woman to me, realizing Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his male characters are not doing well either! I found myself in the same place at the end of Dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink his actions, but of course, he never does!
