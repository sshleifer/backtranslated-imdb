I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2006 and it is a film and not a film since it was apparently shot by HBO for broadcast on its cable network during this year. This film presents Page as a pin-up fetishist of bondage and discipline and a B & D actress who had enough talent to become a real actress. Page was a little more than that and the movie addresses some of her other roles as a model, but not enough to balance the career of the 1950s pin-up icon. This movie is supposed to be based on the book " The Real Bettie Page "by Richard Foster. It was shot in black and white to give the impression of nostalgia of the 1950s. I have the book titled "Bettie Page, the life of a pin-up legend", which contains many beautiful photographs chronicling the career of Page and I must say that this film is reproduced on film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these famous photos are very precisely. Mol herself with the black wig and contact lenses Bettie Page is Bettie Page. Not only does she have the Bettie Page look, but she has the smile and features of her perfect personality across the camera. And his body is as close as possible to a replica of Page. Terrible casting. The story is a little thin and tabloid and could have been much better. But it's a very good TV movie. I would rate it 7.0 on a scale of 10 and recommend viewing it on TV.
