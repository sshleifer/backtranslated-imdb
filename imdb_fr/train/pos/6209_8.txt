The first time I heard that Hal Hartley was doing a sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (it was a personal favorite for years now), and then wary when I heard that it had something to do with to see with terrorism. Having just seen it, I was surprised to find that it worked, while remaining a film totally different from Henry Fool. The screenplay and the staging were irreproachable and the acting was superb ... Special greetings go to Hartley for having put together almost all the cast, until the son of Henry, who was only four years old in the original. As I said, however, this film is quite different from the first, but it works: I reconciled with the change of tone and subject, 10 years have passed and the characters would have been in very different situations since the first film finished. In this case, an unexpected adventure ensues ... and that's about all I'm going to give ... not to mention the fact that I'll have to see her again to really understand what's happening and what's the double crossing of whom. Although it was certainly one of the best movies I've seen for quite some time, it's suffering like a lot of sequels with its end, as it seems like Hartley is preparing a third one now and the movie lets you hang. I will be sure to buy my tickets for Part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) In 2017.
