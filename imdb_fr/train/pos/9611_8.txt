It was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie and quite loyal to my own experience of bulimia. In fact, it has been the subject of extensive research and I can only assume that it was written by someone who had a similar experience because it contained all the little details. The characters were pretty well drawn and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were excellent. I think that what I like most is that they made them precise and intelligent and that the reasons for Beth's bulimia were not neglected (it was not a "diet that had become out of control, because Pressures on girls by the media, "pressures that we will not really face ...") His mother was not completely helpless - too often on television, they address a problem that is of concern THE WORLD and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last men on earth who do not ("Diabetes, what is it?" Oh, my world is all wrong, doctor, explain- me as if I were a little child ", etc.). It was great that her mother was a psychologist and she did not even see the signs. And the scenes in which Beth vomited were not VERY BIG melodramatic and sensationalist, and focused more on the need for secrecy of bulimics and their uncontrollable. The scene where Beth tells her mother that she's bulimic would make me cry if there were no other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Okay, I liked these songs. What has not worked so well for me is the end, which brings us back to the territory of the TV movie that we know and do not particularly like, but I guess they had to conclude. "You too can cure your child's eating disorders if you have a lot of money and live in the United States ..." <br /> <br /> And can I just tell again that I really like Mare Winningham. She is great.
