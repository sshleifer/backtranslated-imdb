Beautiful history of the community of Pimlico in London which, after the explosion of an unexploded bomb dating from the Second World War, finds a royal charter stipulating that the region in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> This movie works because it attracts fantasy that many of us have on setting our own rules without having to listen to them. This is more believable for a solid cast of British followers, especially Stanley Holloway. <br /> <br /> There are some great moments in the movie, like when people run out of supplies and other Londoners next to the barricade start throwing food and stuff . <br /> <br /> Even if you have always known that Pimlico would become part of the UK again, the people of PImlico and, consequently, the viewer do not disturb it. When this happens, it leaves a feeling of good mood. <br /> <br /> It is amazing to think that these low-budget films from a small London studio are still as popular as fifty years later. Producers must have something good.
