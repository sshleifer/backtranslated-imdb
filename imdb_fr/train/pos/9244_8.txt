If you only read a synopsis of the plot, this film will look like a typical film of the 30s. The story seems quite artificial, the subject is maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film lies in the direct and earthy performances of the cast. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow display such a range of feelings, rich and subtle shades floating on his face. If you look at their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the main characters. Raw emotions are so sincerely described, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant: when Clark Gable looks down at his son with such joy and surprise, lifts him up and says proudly, "My child!", I can not help but remember that the son of Mr. Gable was born of him posthumously. This is one of the finest examples of cinema from the era of depression.
