Tom Hanks has starred in blockbusters such as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles have been good guys that we encourage. In Road to Perdition, his character, Michael Sullivan, is a little different. <br /> <br /> In Sam Mendes 'film Road to Perdition based on Max Allan Collins' graphic novel, he tells the story of a man and his son. on the road during the Chicago Great Depression. What's different about this little journey is that Sullivan is a hit-man who is now being pursued by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him almost more than his own son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> After a job poorly done because of Connor, the only witnesses to his mistake are Sullivan and his son who was not supposed to be there. So Connor tries to defeat Sullivan and his family, but only gets his wife and son Peter. Sullivan surpasses the hit and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... sitting. His wife and child dead, Sullivan goes on the road to find answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows both as Sullivan attempts to rectify the situation in memory of his wife and child, and for Michael he is to blame for all this. He feels that his curiosity has killed his mother and his brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a great job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and a sense of being still minor. His loss of innocence is well filled as he travels from town to town, leaving nothing behind him. <br /> <br /> The previous Mendes hit movie was American Beauty, which received five Oscars, including Best Picture and Director. This film did not do as well at the Oscars as one prize for the best photograph, but five other nominations for music, sound and a better supporting actor for Paul Newman. This picture is a beautiful story that takes you on a tour of the Midwest and the legend of Mike Sullivan: a husband, a hitman and a devoted father. This film is a dormant film that should be watched for years.
