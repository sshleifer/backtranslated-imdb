Marjorie (a splendid and captivating performance of Farrah Fawcett) narrowly avoids being assaulted in her car by the naughty serial violin Joe (superbly played with a frightening conviction and intensity of James Russo). However, Joe steals his wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He visits her on a fateful day. After having subjected Marjorie to numerous degradations and psychological abuse, Marjorie manages to reverse the situation and lock her in the fireplace. What will Marjorie do with Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone concoct a harsh, harsh and often disturbing moral tale that accurately describes the cruel brutality and painful contempt of rape, while showing how a person pushed to the extreme is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe perceives women strictly as objects, while Marjorie sees him only as an "animal". However, this film to its admirable merit refuses to make Joe a simple one-dimensional creep; Instead, he is a terribly real and ultimately pitiful human monster with a woman and a child (Joe's decisive confession in particular is truly poignant). Fawcett and Russo are both outstanding in the leading roles; Diana Scarwid, a passive Terry, Alfre Woodard, sensitive Patricia, and Sandy Martin, a caring policewoman, policewoman Sudow, support Diana Scarwid. The agile cinematography of Curtis Clark and that of J.A.C. The frail and creepy Redford score greatly increases the considerable claustrophobic tension. A real central.
