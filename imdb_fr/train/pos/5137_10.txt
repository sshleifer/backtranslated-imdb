Interesting, fast and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those who watch tons and tons of television. I stumbled on this show while I was sick at home with a serious case of flu one day and I became addicted. I had a crush on John Burke. Claire and he did a remarkable job animating the show together. We could really say that they loved their work. <br /> <br /> The segments of super collectors were excellent. I was interested in things I had never thought of before. <br /> <br /> What I really want to know is: What happened to Jack the dog? Has one of the hosts adopted it?
