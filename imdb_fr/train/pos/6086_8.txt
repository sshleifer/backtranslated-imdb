I saw this movie about a year ago and found it completely funny. A real winner, in my mind. There was the underlining of a stupid comedy, but actually had a real plot. A bit like the hit comedy Elf, actually. There were some serious moments, caught between hilarity. When Stiller shot down Black's horse, a usually sober moment, you found yourself laughing at his antics. You can actually find common ground there, because I'm sure a lot of people have done something they would not want a friend to discover, lest your friendship end. <br /> <br /> When I discovered how much people hated this movie, I was completely stunned. The absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite had higher ratings than it puzzles me on the mental health of IMDb users. Follow my advice and praise it. If you do not find yourself laughing at least once, I will compensate you for the rental fee. = D
