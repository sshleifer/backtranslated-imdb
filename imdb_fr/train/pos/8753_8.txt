I saw this film at the theater and I was very impressed. Again, it was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the crazy, arrogant, Hollywood slut she is today. Anyway, this movie really seemed to me to be one of the most raw, realistic and beautiful friendship movies. How far would you really go for your best friend? I was moved to tears at the end and I tore when I look at her now (I own her). I remember that as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and I sobbed her how much I loved her. This is an excellent movie to watch with your best girlfriend. However, get ready for the almost certain conversation after which she turns to you and asks you if you want to do something like this for her ...
