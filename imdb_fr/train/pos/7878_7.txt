Throughout my family's history, my father, Milton Raskin, has played piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the group, my father practiced with him for hours. Then, at one point, my father told Sinatra that he was really too good to be tied to such a small group and that he should venture alone. At that time, Sinatra had enough credits "to her credit" to do just that! Dorsey has never forgiven my father, and the rest, as they say, belongs to history. <br /> <br /> I have some pictures and recordings to this effect, as well as Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I've seen just about every Sinatra movie more than I want, and his movies never get old. . . Thank you Frank
