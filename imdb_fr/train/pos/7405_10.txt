This film is simply beautiful! Everything is there: laugh, sorrow, beauty, poetry, truth. All this in a simple but intense story - like life! You will not be distracted for a second. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone says in Hollywood that you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are so many good stories.
