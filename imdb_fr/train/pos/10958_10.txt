This show is so incredibly hilarious that I could not help but watch the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (despite the fact that I had already seen all the episodes previously). I've always regarded Silverman as a huge talent and it's finally a way to make sure that talent can be appreciated by a wide audience. I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I can not say as much of many TV shows ... can you? This show is finally something new and interesting and (mostly) funny! It's a show I'll never miss and I'll buy it on DVD right out. You have to watch this show ... I predict a long course for this series ... And so that everything is very clear, people who offend this show simply do not understand ... intelligence for understand it ... they should stop making a fool of themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in reference to Silverman, or who claims that it only aims to "shock" ... is completely out of place ... It is exactly the opposite; just look for it on Google and you'll quickly see that it's a strong supporter of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that she ironically adopts all these scandalous views, you do not get it. And if you do not get it, do us a favor and stay silent so we can all enjoy the hilarity ...
