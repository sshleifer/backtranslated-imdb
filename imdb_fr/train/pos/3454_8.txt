First of all, I'm not a fangirl of Justin Timberlake obsessed with looking good. In fact, I'm not even a big fan of Justin, but I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm working on a video and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I had never heard of, I had to see what it was. I did not think Justin was doing so badly, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that were not even on the first credit. The story is basic, a reporter discovering corrupt police officers, but I found it well done. The character of L L Cool J was clearly in conflict, but honestly, I did not know what he would do at the end. Morgan Freeman is, as always, the wise mentor that he has done so well, and although I really like Kevin SPacey, he was a little out there. His character did not have much substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can not do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott was giving the best performance as a homicidal cop. Really believable and really in character, he made me flip a couple of times. <br /> <br /> I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Terrible slogans, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I did not find anything. Each shot scored a goal, it was not a clich√©, rather solid. <br /> <br /> Overall, an amazing cast, a decent story that interested me and gave me enough action to blow me up. I do not know why he did not appear in theaters, it was better than garbage I saw on the big screen. I would say it's worth the trip.
