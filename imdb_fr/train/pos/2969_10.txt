This film talks about two guys who invented a field sport trying to get the 2 hot. BASEketball becomes a national sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but he is hated when he loses the NBA in favor of another rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams, Yasmine Bleeth, and ends up kissing. the first time I saw this movie, I wet my pants, it was so funny. a must see for all comedy fans. If you like South Park, you'll love it! Maybe do not look with kids, it's a bit inappropriate for little guys. some failures give 6 1/2 out of ten, I give him 11 out of ten. I like coop it rocks I have to go bye bye thanks for reading this
