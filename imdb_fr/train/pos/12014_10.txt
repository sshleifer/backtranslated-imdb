This is by far the most incredible movie I've seen in a long time. The actors gave a magnificent representation of the characters of the film. The story has been accurately described. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamship to Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and did not do it. He thinks it is ridiculous to travel and is discouraged. She encourages him to read about the Prophet Joseph Smith. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. The film accurately describes his life and part of the SDJ church's history at the same time. It was sometimes graphic, but it was necessary. The emotional expression was very credible, which caused the distortion of my emotions. Filming was great. The way the story was presented was touching. After the movie, we sat, unable to move. I was stunned. For those who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I encourage you to see him. If nothing else than to gain some understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I encourage you to see it. This will increase your testimony of this most incredible man. It is to see absolutely.
