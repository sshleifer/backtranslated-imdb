Having not seen this film for about 20 years, I am always impressed by its violent impact and stellar acting. Of course, a certain Mr. Mickey Rooney is indeed INCREDIBLE in his role of "Killer" (in reference to another criticism), Orson Welles did not mention the name of Mickey Rooney as being the greatest actor of cinema. I also remember the jazzy-brassy score and nude black-and-white photography. I love Mick's last line before she came out for her lead poisoning dose (I think the Stranglers brought her up for a line of one of their songs - Get a Grip on Yourself). It's a great film and unfairly buried. Let's go out! Footnote - A recent Film Review magazine has written an article about Don Segal's "Babyface Nelson", made a few years before "Last Mile" and starring Mickey Rooney. Another rave of the intense and friendly performance of the Mick. Perhaps this is the beginning of a wave of appreciation for truly superior cinematic performances.
