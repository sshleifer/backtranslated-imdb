Noll's comfortable way of making direct comments, often with explets, to describe things he is more aware of than most people is refreshing enough. There is another character in the movie who is constantly trying to verbalize complicated problems, using more language than necessary. This guy should never have received a thesaurus. Take a look at Noll and you know you're going to feast! <br /> <br /> The way in which the pioneers of the mainsail are depicted evokes very well a "lost time". It does not matter that no one knows how these guys made a living, let alone dealt with problems like medical care. The use of old movie clips has been masterfully done.
