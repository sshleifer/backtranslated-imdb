Corbin Bernsen sent letters to four criminal associates he had worked with in the past. It's a real intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ and Ruben Blades. They must meet him in this dark Montana town and he does not explain why, because he is then arrested by the New Jersey outside police with a warrant. <br /> <br /> The criminals gathered know all Bernsen but do not know each other. A lot of comedy implies that they feel each other. As the oldest Gwynne, however, deny takes things in hand, while others grumble, but continue. Especially when they understood what Bernsen had in mind. <br /> <br /> As for Bernsen, he is fortunate enough to be picked up by a pair of Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck's scorers. O'Neill is trapped and escapes. <br /> <br /> Then, it's the four criminals who are trying to finish what Bernsen started and Bernsen who escapes the police. In the complicated scenario, it is fascinating to see how the two stories intermingle. Hoyt Axton while the local sheriff observes with astonishment what is happening in his city. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a fabulously funny film made by a band of players who seem to have mostly television backgrounds or who would soon be. . I can not say anyone who stands out in the cast, they also seem to click so well together. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of these people are comic in themselves, but they all have a slight comic touch revealed by a good staging. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a very fun caper film, the kind of film that the well-known pessimist would have written.
