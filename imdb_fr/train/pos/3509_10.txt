I saw this movie some time ago and it still appears at the top of the list of my "favorite movies". He is surprisingly staged and what really makes the film is the detailed details (such as the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee case being reused as a cup for washing his grandson's hair) that people do not see. not because you will not understand this movie. IF YOU ARE NOT HISPANIC. This is just one of those movies that is very specific and culturally. Please do not criticize this film if you have no prior knowledge of the foundation on which it is built. I can see exactly what the scriptwriter / director was looking for, and he perfectly fit! This film deserves a better rating.
