I watched the movie with a homophobic friend, my wife and her friend. So I had views from all sorts of directions. Mostly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only notable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think she played her part well, even though the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors, they just did not have complex roles. I congratulate Puya for entering the world of cinema. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor. <br /> <br /> The woman loved the movie, and I think there might have been chords played and to which I did not have the ear for. If the film tried to present unusual sexual behavior and its consequences in today's Romania, it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that girls are really a boy and a girl and that the same story becomes a boring and uninteresting plot. <br /> <br /> I do not see why he received all these BAFTA awards. In my book, he should have received the award "Best luck next time". (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
