If the lion king is a serious story about a young lion growing to avenge the death of his father, the lion king year and a half is the opposite, full of fantasy and joy. The lion king told the story on the side of lion cub Simba, 1 and a half is from the view of Timone and Pumbaa, a duo not perfect consisting of a meercat who left the house because he could not dig tunnel without burying friends and neighbors and a warthog that has an odor problem. The film is a little short on the background, but Disney does a good job of filling the time with various sketches featuring Timone and Pumbaa as they "watch" the movie with us. My favorite is the song that occurs halfway through the movie. Make sure you watch the bouncing virus! Disney has announced a year and a half as "the rest of the story", although this is really not the case. It's just a different perspective of the Lion King, without all the serious stuff that has permeated much of the second half of Disney's original classic. Thank Nathan Lane of Timone and Ernie Sabella of Pumbaa for their vocal work. Without their efforts, the film might not have worked. Singing them, they entertain, and they make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.
