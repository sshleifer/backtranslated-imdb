The genre "gangster" is now a used subject, too often subject to parody. In retrospect, the series is the culmination of previous clich√©s used in its genre. Fortunately, the authors have advanced on this flaw by creating a realism that has been applied to it. The Sopranos is an epic saga of crimes that illustrates its content with a psychological depth characterized by subtle nuances, unadorned humor and violence. The key protagonist, Tony Soprano, is perceived by his crew as a general danger devoid of moral and moral values. However, Tony is one of two characters that is bestial, the other is in conflict with guilt and resentment. Without any inhibition or contradiction, I continue to believe that The Sopranos has the best overall distribution of recent memory. All things considered, I could make a complex statement about the series, but I will not do it. If ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism, look for these vital, ambiguous, implacable, epic, uncompromising definitions and the sopranos' sbroken face will smile upon you.
