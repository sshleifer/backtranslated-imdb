I saw this film in a university film festival in the 70's - I was ALWAYS waiting for this film to be filmed (well, it came out). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed that was why it was not available on video yet. I check for 15 years the video libraries that this exceptional film will be released! This is one of my favorites of all time - but beware, it is strange, just like Werner Herzog, its strangeness comes from its super realism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real incident A few centuries ago, in the pre-colonial era, when Europeans met for the first time the Amazonian tribes. A white man is confused with a wild tribe of cannibals as his enemy, so they intend to kill him. However, before sending it, they are part of their tribe (their custom). The whole movie is like watching a National Geographic documentary as it becomes an accepted member of their tribe. That's all. Cosmic intrigue? No. Intense glimpse of the variety of human life? Absolutely. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... be warned ... this film has a definitive nudity - it's not a Hollywood film of schlock on wild nobles ... this film tells how it was (re-read above: National Geographic, super realism) <br /> <br />
