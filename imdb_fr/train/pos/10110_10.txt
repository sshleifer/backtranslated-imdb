Any story includes a premise, characters, and conflicts. The characters who play their own game promise triumph, and a militant character willingly lends itself to it. The principle of Ardh Satya is summarized by the poem of the same name written by Dilip Chitre. The line is: "ek palde mein napunsaktha, doo pal mein paurush, ya tarazu ke kaante par, ardh satya?". A rough translation - "The delicate balance between good and evil (what is commonly seen on the busts of blind justice before the courts) has impotence on one plate and the prowess on another. in the center is it a half-truth? " > <br /> The poem is recited halfway through the film of Smita Patil at Om Puri in a restaurant. This has a profound impact on the protagonist and lays the groundwork for most subsequent events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri finds himself exactly in the situation described so accurately in the poem. <br /> <br /> The film makes a serious effort to make a one-up on the poem. However, Chitr√©'s words are too powerful and, at best, the film corresponds to the poem in all its aspects. <br /> <br />
