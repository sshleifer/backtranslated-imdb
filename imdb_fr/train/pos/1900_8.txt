The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his short career in ARTHUR in 1981, a touching and touching story that generates warm smiles, laughter and occasional tears if you're in a good mood. Moore received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his performance of Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who "runs cars, plays tennis, caresses women, but he has weekends and he is his own boss. ". Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), a girl of the pretentious society, who is the spoiled girl of an infiltrated gangster. Things get complicated when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli), a troubled waitress / actress from Queens, who steals ties for her father's birthday. Moore illuminates the screen during one of the funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won Best Supporting Actress for his irreproachable role as Arthur's butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward contempt for Arthur's behavior includes more paternal sentiments. There are other fun contributions from Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as the father of Susan and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's crazy grandmother. The film was made with a keen sense of comedy by first director, Steve Gordon, who unfortunately died the following year. There was also a forgotten suite several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.
