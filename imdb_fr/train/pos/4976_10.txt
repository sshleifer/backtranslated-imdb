A film by Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE. <br /> <br /> Keeping the blood flowing through our veins is the responsibility of the HEMO THE Magnificent worker. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, AT & T and Bell Science teamed up with famous Hollywood director Frank Capra to produce a series of CBS science fiction films to inform the public about the universe that surround them. Far from the meager black and white fodder so often imposed on young researchers, Capra's films would educate and entertain with live scripts and catchy images shown in Technicolor. The four films - OUR MR. SUN (1956), THE STRANGE CASE OF COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNCHARED DOG (1958) - quickly became the favorites of schools, where they were tirelessly presented in 16 mm format. <br /> <br /> The star of the series was Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), an affable English teacher at the University of Southern California. This avuncular pedagogue turned out to be the ideal movie instructor, geniusally conveying to his audience sometimes complex facts in a way that never made them boring or boring. Dr. Baxter, winner of the Peabody Award for his achievements, continued to produce high quality educational films after the conclusion of the Capra Quartet. <br /> <br /> HEMO THE Magnificent, produced, written and directed by Capra, tells the story of the human heart and the blood circulation system, using animation and soft humor. Movie star Richard Carlson appears as the fictional screenwriter, energetically helping Dr. Baxter tell the story of Hemo. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the television production team, as well as the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray and Pinto Colvig as various cartoon characters , all uncredited. <br /> <br /> The devotional scripture that begins the film is perfectly in tune with the tone and content of the production.
