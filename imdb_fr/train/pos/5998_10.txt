The Cure is an amazing movie ... so captivating and so real! I had the chance to attend a screening of 'The Cure' during its premiere in New York and it completely blew me away! I also heard that this festival won an award and deserved it. The first thing that struck me was the cinematography. Eric Giovon did an amazing job. The filming style of the love scene halfway through the film was incredible. A love scene was needed in this film, and Jafri spread the message but also kept the scene in good taste. Giovon and Jafri are an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects. Judy Maier's narration was so surreal but simultaneously heartbreaking, it made me feel what the main character felt. I am a very hard critic, but I must say that The Cure is one of my favorite movies. JUST LOVE IT! If you have not seen it yet, go see it!
