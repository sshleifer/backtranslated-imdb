This is a chopper movie starring love through the ages. The film is composed of Keaton seeking a lady-love in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920s). In all three cases, he's the usual Buster and he's fighting Wallace Beery for his lover. Of the three periods, I think I preferred the Roman even if I admit that it could have been the most cheesy. In fact, I enjoyed the scenes with the lion who was obviously a guy in costume and the strange race of tanks in the snow - but what I liked the most is to see all the incredible acrobatics from Keaton. However, the three periods were very entertaining and the film, although not its best, is still an exceptional and enjoyable film. Check it out!
