When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the magician Gandalf investigates and discovers that this ring is an ancient creation of a wicked lord of darkness. If the ring is in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy Middle-earth. Frodo and his faithful friends embarked on a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. It is an underestimated adaptation of the classic novels because it covers only the first half of the story. Anyway, it's an epic and wonderfully animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is superbly done with a rotoscope, which traces live action sequences. Ralph Bakshi worked well with his small budget. The film also features a score by Leonard Rosenman that suits all scenes. There are a few holes in the plot with the script, but you do not want to, since the original agreement was to turn the trilogy of books into two films, many of which had to be piled up in the first. My biggest complaint is part of the character's design, Samwise was a little too clumsy, while the other hobbits act quite normal. The other characters are actually well written for the screen and voice actors do a great job. I'm glad Legolas is actually a little more useful for the plot. Rotoscopic orcs are more comical than frightening, while ringwraiths are strange and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the evil sorcerer Saruman is called Aruman, thanks to the writers. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers would have made it a lot, but there is something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi has made a valiant effort to adapt these classic stories to the screen. The film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by live action movies, but it's still an excellent movie for animation fans of all ages.
