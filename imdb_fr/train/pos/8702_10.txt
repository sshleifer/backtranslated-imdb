A woman stops a boy in this world and is alone. They were both alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was able to pull the sword from his arm. There was always a wrist injury to the cause of this "gift" - the most lethal weapon wound inside his body. First, he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. As simple as all the time for a superhero - it reaches justice ... but society decides that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is quite right, because it's not like in Hollywood movies that the character tries to kill anyone - Sasha (he is the main hero interpreted by Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person who, in his opinion, deserves to die but gets blamed by the authorities and runs away . In such a flight from the authorities and the mafia, he meets a girl (interpreted by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. All the rest must be watched ... not said. Know that this film speaks more of feelings and emotions but not actions. This film is full of pain of the main character and his vision of life.
