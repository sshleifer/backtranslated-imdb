Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and I was afraid he would make a children's movie, because I would not want him to leave his films that I loved so much: Visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, the killer and Black Socioty Trilogy. Recently, he seems to be exploring new territories and I think he is succeeding. It was the first of his films that I had seen him take that direction, so I was nervous. Of course, I bought it without seeing it and I was happy to have done it. <br /> <br /> The Great War of Yokai is a perfect film for children and adults should enjoy it too. The whole movie reminded me so much of the movies I loved as a kid: endless story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz, and so on. I enjoyed these films because they did not treat children as stupid and neither did they. . The underlying morals are there, but it's as ridiculous as any children's movie should be. Personally, the CGI and the prostheses did not bother me. I think they are fine and do not think the kids will notice. <br /> <br /> If you are an unconditional fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like this one. But, I suggest trying it. This proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I suspected. He also continues to make his signature with Miike's films outside of them, which is very reassuring. <br /> <br /> For those who are new to Takashi Miike and want something light or dramatic like this one, I suggest other Miike movies: 'Zebraman' '' Happiness Katakuris '' 'Sabu' and 'The bird people in China.' <br /> <br /> Good job Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
