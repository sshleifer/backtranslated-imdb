I was lucky to watch this movie because I had a new free version of Blockbuster and had to grab something quickly as the store was preparing to close for the evening. The plain white blanket and the title intrigued me. I am (relatively speaking) an "old" lady and my son is a young man of 30 years old. I love movies that are pure entertainment, such as The Sixth Sense, Interview with a vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, has a degree in cinema and likes very specialized foreign films, such as those made by Bergman or Hertzog. We generally hate each other's movie choices, however, we both LOOKED and LOVED the movie NOTHING! It did not look like any movie we've ever seen before. We are both cynical / critical personality types and we usually watch movies as we watch them - but in this case we simply laughed and enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. We are of the opinion that if this film had been promoted and screened in major American theaters, it would have worked very well.
