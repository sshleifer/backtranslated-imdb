A very undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in a spiral of domestic violence increasingly dark. <br /> <br /> Sometimes difficult to watch, while Morris Day is described as the misogynist, Prince as the knight on the courier (motorcycle), he is always called to beat a woman twice in the scenario. The fact that he can do this and that he always comes out as an imperfect but justified hero is to put to the credit of writing. Prince is so ego-free in this film that he describes himself not only as a narcissistic megalomaniac who defeats women, but that his most famous song is fictional as written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. Even further, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (certainly the weakest title on the album) and Darling Nikki - are presented as songs that kill an audience. Perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a map that reads 5'6 for Apollonia (slightly shorter than Prince). <br /> <br /> The distribution, almost entirely amateurish, is mainly composed of group members who play Slate themselves the actors on terms that they have never appeared in other films completely miss the point ), and do perfectly well under the direction. Morris Day receives most of the congratulations for his nice ham, although Jerome Benton must also be rewarded for bouncing back, especially for his hilarious theater number. Day and Benton even make a routine of Abbott and Costello fun, which requires some effort. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is Prince. Although I admit to having a bias, I actually think he is a very good actor in terms of his ability to portray a discrete version of himself. In his job, this movie was made for entertainment, so anyone who will emphasize that the main role is not Robert DeNiro and thinks he is arguing his point is unfortunately misled. I do not want this criticism to be a derisory attack on other people's comments, but I even claimed that this film had a small budget and was dark. How could a film about domestic violence be shot? With suspended projectors and a CGI dinosaur that comes into the frame? <br /> <br /> The film acts almost like a perfect snapshot of the neon era and the thin tie ?? until you remember that it was done in a world of curly perms and metal synths, and that it's not a retro-recess. Prince's best film with Oscar-winning music, he sees it at its zenith, and it's heartbreaking to realize that even if he's making great albums, he'll never capture that record again.
