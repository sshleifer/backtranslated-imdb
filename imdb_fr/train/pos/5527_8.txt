There may be a particular reason why The Fox and the Child hit a special note in my heart. Having just said goodbye to my new fianc√©e - oh ... one day - for an unknown time, I was a little overwhelmed by various emotions and I suffered the fallout of having put the courageous face that she had to see. <Br/> <br /> I watched some movies and TV shows, but my interest varied from what I left behind to what exists and what I did not see. For that, I want to thank this movie. <br /> <br /> Being a nature lover and having heard about the movie in advance, I was sure I would love him anyway. But I did not like, I loved it. <br /> <br /> The technical mastery is stunning. How did they do it? How did they capture the animals as they did? It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is good and, even if its end is so French and so ambiguous, it's a happy / sad moment. Again, it took me a little off guard. As a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the end was tough as I would be on a plane filled with people I would meet in the next 15 hours! It may be because the end made me think back to what I left. <br /> <br /> But during those few hours on the plane, I was happy to see something new and original. And that's life. Of course, there are those things that you like and where you feel comfortable ... but the open spaces are full of mysteries. So next time I see something out of the ordinary while she's out in the open; I will explore, observe and kiss him. This is exactly what happens in this movie and that's exactly what you should do with this damn good movie / documentary about nature. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It is two months of the plane. We still do not know when we'll meet again, but we'll do it.
