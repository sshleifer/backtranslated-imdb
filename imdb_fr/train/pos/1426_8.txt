I must say that sometimes all that matters is the "looks", as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC pointed out (not about our planet, but he's still right). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to This movie is so amazing beauty that you will absolutely love what your eyes are seeing. <br /> <br /> And then, there's also the film's personality, interesting, with a narrative voice and a captivating narrator Stories that will touch your soul as you watch these beautifully filmed images. <br /> <br /> The film will probably not affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will not fail to remind you how valuable our land is. <br /> <br /> This film deserves its 10 stars because it is one of the rare stylistic documentaries on the earth that I really appreciated.
