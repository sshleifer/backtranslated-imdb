Like many horror fans, I've been force-fed with the same big-budget Hollywood shuffles and MTV high school slasher guts for 20 years. Here is finally an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool vehicles and you want blood a lot of things, at the expense of the bucket - you'll have understood. <br /> <br /> The excellent choreography of the fight and the supporting role of the Hammer Horror screaming Queen Stephanie Beacham, it's really fantastic. <br /> <br /> Despite his low budget, by choosing to use a 35mm support and adding quality synthesis effects to the mix, director James Eaves has created something that seems much bigger. <br /> <br /> A must for old school fans.
