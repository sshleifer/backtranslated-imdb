I remember attending his original broadcast in 1962 at the age of five or six and really enjoying it. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since, as it aired on "Walt Disney Presents" on Disney Channel. I had almost forgotten everything, and some was for the kids, but it was still nice. I can not wait to show it to my niece and nephews.
