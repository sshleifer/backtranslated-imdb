THE MATADOR (2005) *** _ Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on a mission to Mexico, where he befriends a man from American business yet sympathetic (Kinnear under his most affable) and discovers that there is more to live than death. Beginning filmmaker Richard Shepard debuts on the big screen with a particularly evil black comedy, attentive to visual details, nuanced dialogue and character development, making him a talent to watch in this breath of fresh air. "Formula concealing what is expected of its tracks and allowing Brosnan to leave his ya-yas with an evil joy. A sleeper indie jewel hit.
