Being half Portuguese does not make me half-blind (or half-prejudiced) when I talk about Portuguese films. Not that I do that very often anyway. But this movie was such an adrenaline rush! Yes, it's true - most of the time, that's right, but the story has nothing to envy to Portuguese films: use real venues in the heart of Lisbon, congested by traffic, and recruit a crowd replace the real crowd of almost 30 years ago. And by God do they understand! OK, to sum up: very moved if you experienced this, but you will notice minor improvements that could have been made as well as the necessities of the plot. If you are just watching this video at random, you are living a good historical adventure, only of the type History very recent and a little more convincing than usual. Even by European standards, yes.
