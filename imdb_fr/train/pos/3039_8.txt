Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning biopic, Patton, follows him with a powerful tribute to another of the American combat generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man, his genius and his selfishness. With MacArthur, you never know exactly where one started and the other stopped and all too often they mixed. <br /> <br /> The entire story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour film or a television mini-series. This would cover him from his days at border posts with his family until he moved to West Point, where he still has the highest grade average ever attained by a cadet. He spoke of his service in the Philippines as a young officer, of his legend that built bravery on the battlefields of the First World War in France. He would also have to say that he fired on the bonus World War I walkers in 1932, probably putting the final kabosh on President Herbert Hoover's chances of being re-elected. In the last years of MacArthur, he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. This must be a subject they have avoided. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the years 1941 to 1952 and is told in flashback. The film begins with MacArthur speaking to students in 1962. As he speaks the words of Duty Honor Country's famous speech, MacArthur returns to World War II and his desperate struggle against the Japanese advance on the island. Corregidor and the Bataan on Luzon. The film guides him in his struggle to regain the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months of his career, resulting in his renunciation of President Truman. <br /> <br /> MacArthur as a film would not work at all if it is not the representations of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, respectively. This is the part of the film that I liked the most, considering MacArthur and his relationship with these two men. <br /> <br /> O'Herlihy's FDR captures the aristocratic knight and exceptionally devious man who was our 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who expressed his arguments with unusual subtlety and intelligence. Sometimes he liked talking about it too much, but he was the political master of the last century. Note how he treats MacArthur as both commander and potential rival on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Truman from Flanders is like people remember him, a very confused man among people who did not like MacArthur's pride in the gitgo. . Of course, it was in the history books that Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, there is no doubt. <br /> <br /> Still, I could write a whole thesis on Truman-MacArthur relationships. Along the way, he does not need to ever be in crisis. I always thought that FDR would have solved the problem much more effectively if he had always been president. <br /> <br /> MacArthur was also a great eloquent and Gregory Peck reports to a certain extent. the speeches that made it a legend as well as victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck witness the Japanese surrender, MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress and, of course, his speech to the cadets in 1962. Look at the news and see if you're not agreement.
