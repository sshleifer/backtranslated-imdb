I admit that the first time I watched Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, I did not think it was truly memorable. But now, after seeing her for the seventh time, I admit that it has grown a lot for me. The characters of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean and the Countess have become very endearing. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think that satirical humor largely compensates for it. Then there's the K-D soundtrack that features the very talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) at his best. I can not think of any film that "grew on me" after an unsuitable first impression, as much as Cowgirls did.
