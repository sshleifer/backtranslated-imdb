Mina Kumari shows more style and grace than standing or sitting on the floor, unlike most other movies. The director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it seems possible. The music and dance are of the highest quality possible. You may notice that in the first dance scene, the director has all sorts of things going on in the background: another girl dancing, a drunkard falling down the stairs, a lot of activity, but he knew we would watch Mina dance and I would bet to see this many times, you did not notice it. All in all, perfection.JQ
