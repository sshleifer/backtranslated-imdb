Strangely, all the previous comments just described the beginning and left the details aside. I feel the need to confirm that this is a family job, since Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein and that the - excellent - jazz music was written by the director's father, Andr√©. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that it is a very good thriller, seen when it came out and immediately identified with the music. The suspense was flawless and lasted until the end. Robert Hossein, then one of the best European players, has also managed to establish himself as a big screen and director. He always rides great shows, with a preference for religious subjects.
