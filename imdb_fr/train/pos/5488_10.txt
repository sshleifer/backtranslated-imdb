A case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating film. It's easy to understand why Chavez is so popular with his people. It makes things happen. It is accessible. And it's also easy to see why the West hates him so much. He controls the resources of his country and returns the profits to the people. Especially the poor. And it's easy to see how TV channels can portray deceptive images to put their case. Just like the war in Iraq or the war against terror. Or those lacking ADM. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the neo-conservatives in power. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And make your own decision. Then I suggest you to see Aaron Russo: America: Freedom to Fascism. It is not the peoples of America that are problematic. It's the government.
