Roman Polanski is considered one of the most important directors of our time, like the spirit of classics such as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown". What makes Polanski's cinema very interesting is the fact that he is able to create commercially attractive films such as the above-mentioned masterpieces, but he also likes to make discreet films. more personal. "The tenant" or "The tenant" is one of these films; A horror / suspense story about paranoia and obsession that counts among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Polanski himself plays the role of Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. When he finally finds one, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, tried to kill himself by jumping out the window. After Simone died from her wounds, Trelkovsky began to be obsessed with her, to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants of the building. <br /> <br /> While sharing the same claustrophobic feeling with her other "apartment-themed" movies ("Repulsion &" Rosemary's Baby "), this film focuses on the odd plot that may not be entirely in Trelkovsky's head, the catastrophic effects of paranoia on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the former tenant. <br /> <br /> Polanski perfectly describes Trelkovsky's descent into the darkness. performance seems strange and woody, we slowly discover that Polanski acts in this way because Trelkovsky is supposed to be acted in this way, like a lifeless simple, who traps himself in this maddening sub-world which is inhabited by a collection of strange people Supporting actors really gave life to people in the building creating unforgettable characters This is very important for the success of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, the beautiful cinematography used by Polanski in the fi It helps to increase the sense of isolation and gives life to the magnificent building that serves as a cage for Trelkovsky. The haunting images used by Polanski to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and appealing. <br /> <br /> If the film has a flaw, it's a bit slow at first. this may seem like an obstacle, but in fact, the slowness of the beginning works perfectly because it mimics Trelkovsky's boring life and the way he gradually enters a different realm. In addition, the complicated scenario is certainly not easy to understand because of the many complex layers involved. However, more than a default, it is a joy to face a plot that provokes reflection, like this one. <br /> <br /> While "The Tenant" may not be suitable for everyone, those who are interested in psychological horror and the surrealist scenario will be happy with the experience. "The tenant" is really one of the masterpieces of Roman Polanksi. 10/10
