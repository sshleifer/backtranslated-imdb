I love horses and I admire hand drawn animation. I was not expecting anything from the astonishment of the new animated Dreamworks, Spirit: The Cimarron stallion. I guess you could say I was a little disappointed. You have a wonderful animation and at first sight what seems to be a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. Animals do not sing beautiful songs and do not even speak - a major advantage. Unfortunately, the film presents a misplaced narrative for Matt Damon; a winding soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the filmmakers had just stayed simple, we would have a masterpiece here. It's not a good movie, but it's a good entertainment for little kids. I would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and is the only thing that is not offensive at the moment. Not bad, but could have been much better. Very pretty visuals though.
