The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is again on the screen and many people in the world of culture will notice him. The director puts us in coincidence with Alexander's story, a chaplinesque study distracted from chess addiction. Nastasya is on vacation in a marble seaside resort where a chess championship is held. She meets Alexander, picking up a queen's room and dropping it in his coat pocket. A magnetic attraction develops by which he proposes the next day, the alarmed mother telegrams the husband. He arrives and questions Alexander, we find these fainting in the past, like Godfather II, where we see the young Alexander, a child prodigy. He is taken under the wing of a teacher and exploits his genius for 10 years by making huge sums. Thinking that Alexander has reached his peak, abandons him but becomes a legend. The old professor comes back hurtful, trying to give the victory to an old rival of Alexander. In a serious chess game where the victory of the world chess champion is a means of immortality, the chess clock sounds, the match time ends and ends the next day. That day is the marriage of Nastasya, the old professor intervenes and Alexander is sent to a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her belly and looking through the cloak of her love, discovers her strategy for the match and follows the moves. Although the film unfortunately derives from its Russian roots, its low dresses are adorable, Alexander plays his role in a sublime way. The director has underestimated his audience, we almost never manage to play and the only clue of The Luzhin Defense is after the opponents king with your 3 paws and king, sacrificing the castle for companion. Nastasya is a very good match, but thinks his conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right when controlling chess meant more to him than to her. The Luzhin Defense elegantly honors Navokov, the complexity of his work in pictures is a world event not to be missed.
