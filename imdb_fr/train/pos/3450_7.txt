Having never heard of this movie before I saw the rental DVD I a little skeptical, there have been a lot of movies in the past with good casting together that can not do anything if the screenplay is bad , and in some cases do not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Well, after watching it, there was no reason not to give this film a theatrical release, that's fine. The story, like most people like this, may seem a little forced at times, but there seems to be a good realism that also allows the momentum to spread. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the work that Justin Timberlake accomplishes here with such an important role. OK, he is not an Oscar yet, but he will learn with every role and he shows a LOT of promises for the future. Dylan McDermott was also incredibly good in his unexpected role and he is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, try it. you will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be more than satisfied with the end result.
