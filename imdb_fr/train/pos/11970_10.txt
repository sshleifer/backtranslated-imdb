Full House came to me at about 9 years old. I remember watching the funniest American videos with Bob Saget. One day, my mother told me that he was also participating in a program called Full House. One day, I had the chance to witness an episode while visiting the family. It did not seem very interesting at first, but as I watched more and more parties at 9 o'clock, I felt so much inside. <br /> <br /> This show really makes you want to be there. yourself, go out with the girls, go with them, and maybe even join their little family "sing". <br /> <br /> The thing I like most about Full House is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. Some parts are more for adults, then for children, so that the whole family can enjoy it. Although it's tacky, it's still a good show, and I would recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
