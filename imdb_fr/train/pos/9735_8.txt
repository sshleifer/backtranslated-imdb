Romantic comedy is not the way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people". The underlying romance in the plot is, for the most part, replaced by a much more interesting narrative "Rags to Wealth". Although the central line of the story is a little outdated, in several screenshots, it has a sense of; get the minimum password, focusing on the key relationships that make the "office politics" and using these almost unimportant scenes, used only for comic effects. Still, it works so well, especially with Pegg on the front seat. The film is ultimately very intelligent, playing well on the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his co-stars and merging rather well and quite refreshing the intersection between high and low society in a scenario that, despite the predictability, is rather unique. journey. The different characters of the film are well presented and the cast is definitely an advantage of the film. The relationship between "places of business" between Pegg and Huston and the "love, hate" relationship between Pegg and Dunst works so well in a story that, for lack of a better word, is charming. Even Fox, whose main asset is of course the sex appeal, is shocked by what turns out to be a rather dark character and plays too well this role. This is one of those films where every detail pays tribute to outstanding work. From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack, everything fits perfectly into what can only be described as an intelligent comedy.
