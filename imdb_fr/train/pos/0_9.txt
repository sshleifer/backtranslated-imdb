Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It was happening at the same time as other programs on school life, such as "Teachers". My 35 years of experience in the teaching profession lead me to think that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than that of "Teachers". The rush for financial survival, the insightful students who can see through the pomp of their pathetic teachers, the smallness of the situation as a whole, remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student had repeatedly tried to set the school on fire, I immediately remembered ......... at .......... High . A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to fire one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age to think that Bromwell High is exaggerated. What a pity that this is not the case!
