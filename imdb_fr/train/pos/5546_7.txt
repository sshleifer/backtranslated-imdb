Some people say it's the best movie PRC has ever released. I'm not so sure because I have a place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I would say it's probably one of the most unique movies they, or any other studio, major or minor, have ever released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of a poorly executed smuggler has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him and all their children in the spring. In this mix comes the granddaughter of a ghost victim, the current smuggler. She takes charge of the ferry activity as the ghost gets closer to the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Wrapped in a thick fog and installed mainly in the only marsh setting, it is a more musical poem than the regular feature film. rhythms of dialogue, especially in the first scenes, is a poetic cadence. Similarly, the work of the camera has a similar pace because it travels the swamp as if it crossed the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera, oratorio or musical object course more than a normal horror film. It is an extraordinary film that is probably unique in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not for the Lilly Guild. It's a horror / mystery budget that tells you a nice little story that will entertain you. Her story of love and revenge is what counts here, not cinematographic poetry, but it attracts first of all attention (the technical aspects are only makeup). If there is a fault, it is because production is cheap. The fog creates an atmosphere, but it also hides the fact that this marsh is entirely on dry land. Constant back and forth is acceptable for a while, but even after 58 minutes you want us to see something else. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I really like the movie. It's a good little film that I wish a little less struck by poverty. This is really worth a look if you can find it.
