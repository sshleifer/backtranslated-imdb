The obsession comes in many flavors and exists for various reasons. for some, it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it can be a means of survival. Lack of support, combined with an inability to negotiate the simplest necessities of everyday life or basic social requirements, may even require a genius to enthusiastically embrace what constitutes a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of this satisfaction can become an overt obsession, pushing it until what began as a means of survival becomes the very momentum of its loss, and as we discover in " The Luzhin Defense ", led by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence will not ensure a satisfactory solution to the problem and, in fact, could even worsen the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudices or preferences; moreover, it does not give a quarter. <br /> <br /> Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of the many participants in a 1920s Italian-style chess tournament whose winner will be the World. Champion. Luzhin is a master of the game, but he is vulnerable because chess has long since ceased to be a game for him; it is rather his obsession, the discovery of a thing in childhood that has earned him total incompetence in all areas of life and allowed him to face the discreet subtleties of his immediate family. Luzhin is therefore a genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw that perhaps only one other person knows and understands, and what is more, realizes that he can be exploited to his personal advantage during this tournament. This man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), the former mentor of Luzhin, who, after a few years of absence, suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin. <br /> <br /> Valentinov is a disconcerting and unwelcoming presence at Luzhin. once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent of the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against whom, in a previous match, he drew after 14 hours, but he was also trying to solve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he just met at the station, Natalia (Emily Watson). And, as good as it is, dark clouds are gathering above him, likely to push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well as the curse, of his whole life. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of Luzhin, Gorris uses flashbacks effectively to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that quickly led to his obsession with chess. And as his background is established, he offers perspectives that allow the public to better understand who Louzhin is and how he has come to this point in his life. For the scenes of his childhood, Gorris texture them in a dark atmosphere and a subtle presentiment that creep into the more pastoral setting of the station. The transitions through which she weaves the past and the present are well managed, and with the rhythm that Gorris gives, the result is a presentation that is both fascinating and unhurried and works extremely well. It also minimizes the threat created by Valentinov's presence, focusing on drama rather than suspense, which ultimately serves to accentuate the overall impact of the film, making the Loujine tragedy all the more credible and troubling. <br /> <br /> However, the decisive element of this film is the touching performance of John Turturro. For this film to work, Loujine must be absolutely credible. a fake moment or feint would be disastrous, as it would immediately take the viewer out of the story. This does not happen, however, and the film works, because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true to reality. He captures Luzhin's genius, as well as his shortcomings, and presents his character in exceptionally revealing and very real terms. It is a performance equal to or even superior to that of David Helfgott in "Shine" by Geoffrey Rush. And when you compare his work here with other characters he created, from Sid Lidz in "Unstrung Heroes" to Pete in "O Brother Where Th Thou?" At Al Fountain in "Box of Moonlight", you realize what incredible range Turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist. He is truly a remarkable artist. <br /> <br /> As Natalia, Emily Watson is also excellent, in a rather reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite well. Although she must be somewhat extroverted to have relations with Luzhin, Watson manages to do it in an introspective and totally effective way. More importantly, because of the details of his performance, his accelerated relationship with Luzhin is credible and gives full credibility to the story. You only have to look in Watson's eyes to know that the feelings she conveys are real. It's a great job for a talented and talented actor. <br /> <br /> The support troupe includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna) and Mark Tandy (Luzhin's father), Kelly Hunter (the mother of Luzhin), Alexander Hunting (the young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well designed and presented, `The Luzhin Defense 'is an emotional film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a feeling of sadness and perhaps a reflection on the inhumanity of man towards man. We obviously do not need a film to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the film media when it reminds us of something we should never forget, as we all have the ability to make positive changes and improve the lives of those around us. I note this one 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
