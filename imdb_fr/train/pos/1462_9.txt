In this documentary, we meet Roger, the rich manager of a factory in China that makes pearls and other trinkets sold and traded at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger says that the girls at the factory love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it offers, but the interviews of four of them tell a different story. The sad life of girls is contrasted with the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras itself. The filmmaker David Redmon is to be congratulated for having obtained excellent and rare scenes of the daily life in a Chinese factory and for having obtained a revealing interview in front of the camera of the person in charge of the American company which imports and sells the pearls. The film is convincingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window on what lies behind these ubiquitous "Made in China" labels.
