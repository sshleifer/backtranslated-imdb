Intense actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward join forces to make this movie a success. Of the three, I do not know who was the most interesting, because all offer good performances and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patric narrates in this dark, playing an ex-boxer and a mental patient. Wow, that alone makes for an interesting guy! He looks silly, but he is not. Ward is the complicit, seductive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate accomplice of a kidnapping plan that goes wrong. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in every film. <br /> <br /> The film could be considered a kind of criticism for the average viewer, but I found it fascinating .... and I do not like depressing movies normally. What I found was some kind of original detective film. Take a look and see if you agree. It's a rather unknown movie that should not have this status because it's just a good story and well done.
