I could not have been happier; I was only eight years old in 1983 and I was going to see a Star Wars movie in the cinema! The best day of my life was about to arrive. At that time, my only experience with Star Wars was some Star Wars performances by HBO. I had not even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet. <br /> <br /> And the boy, that day, I delivered the goods to my eyes less critical. Jabba. Great rebel spaceships. The emperor. A green lightsaber !! Wow! Since that magic day, I had to watch this movie hundreds of times. I can not even form an accurate estimate at this point. With these multiple views, I have of course observed that this film - REAL Episode III - had its flaws. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the context of a Star Wars movie, these "flaws" look more like "quirks". <br /> <br /> Millions lived their magic day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had mine. And it was my movie Star Wars.
