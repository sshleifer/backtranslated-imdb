This is the second film I saw about Ida Lupino as a director after the 53-year-old hitchhiker. I think this one was a better movie than this one. He has a girl who is about to get married and is then sexually assaulted and does not like everyone to look at her and talk about it, so she runs away and is taken care of by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's opinion is just to give him 2 and a half stars.
