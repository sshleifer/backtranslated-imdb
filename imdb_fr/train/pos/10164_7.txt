It's a very good film. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a girls movie and some ended up with that. I had never heard of it or anyone else (except Mike from Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give amazing performances. Humor is always dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays quite well the micro character of Friends (which works very well). The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is stereotyped (I mean, we are not talking about 'Apocalypse Now' here), but the characters are nice, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, the production and the realization work well. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a good film that feels good and deserves a lot more credit than it deserves. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I really do not understand the critics a star for that.
