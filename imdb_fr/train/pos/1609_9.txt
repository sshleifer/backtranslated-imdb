"Moonstruck" is a film that I liked the first time I watched it. I really liked the second time. I liked it the third time. Now, it's one of my favorites of all time. <br /> <br /> The humor is subtle but really good. The film offers a lot of warm humor. the story takes place in an old neighborhood of the Italian school in New York. Cher's search for love is enjoyable to watch. This film is, by far, the best possible work of Nicholas Cage. The old man's character is fantastic. He lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with his dogs screaming on the moon was fantastic. But the best character is perhaps that of Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is a scene where the main characters have lunched around an oatmeal breakfast in the family kitchen. Outstanding direction and conclude.
