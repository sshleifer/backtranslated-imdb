When I saw this film for the first time in the 1980s, I was in my teens and somewhat reluctant to see it since I considered myself mature and out of the age of "Sesame Street / Muppets". Honestly, I do not remember if I liked it or not. However, somewhere in college, I watched this movie again and ended up entering (and staying) in my personal Best Movies Ever collection. <br /> <br /> This film is LOADED with a humor that goes far beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets. I mean, of course, the Muppets have always attracted adults and children because there is humor for both generations. But come on ... Janice accidentally heard someone say "I do not undress anyone, even if it's artistic" ... there's a joke from a father to a son who is so loving Kermit's son the frog then the father does not want to hear it ... Gonzo saves a hen with a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and then says "I think we're engaged now" ... these and full of other moments in the film made me roll. Add to this very clever dialogue, New York / Broadway's very smart "wink wink" humor, the usual large number of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that do not get confused with a "kid cheese" .. This film is a masterpiece! I do not regularly throw the "10" ... but this one deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film is totally, maybe even more. The Muppets have never been and never will be, as funny and intelligent and just as brilliant as this film was and is. --- Q
