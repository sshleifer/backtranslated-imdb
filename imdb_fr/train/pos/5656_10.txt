I could never remember the name of this show. I used to watch it when I was 8 years old. I remember standing up late when I was not supposed to do it just to watch this show. It was the best show for me. From what I remember, it's still great. That showed Lucas Black making him the first boy I had a crush on. I am from the country. Therefore, boys with an accent do not appeal to me, but I would certainly make an exception for him. After seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift, you should see why. He is a great actor since his childhood. I miss this show and wish him back. If anyone ever sees where he sells the season, please send me an email. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
