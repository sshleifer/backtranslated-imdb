It could not have been better. The strong constraints imposed on Mike Sullivan's expressions could not have been described otherwise. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. The young Tyler Hoechlin drives a wheel of emotion; play the basic character of the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances for a long time. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a father / son story that essentially uses the two candidates only for the roles. As Mike Sollivan did not have a father, John Rooney welcomed him. Although generous, Mr. Rooney became involved in organized crime. As a result, Sullivan's debt was only to be repaid by becoming involved in the trade. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his kids safe, but at the same time, he's paying off his boss. Upcoming events will test Sullivan's loyalty and understand the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> Thanks to an excellent adaptation of David Self, the dialogue rarely happens, but remains very virtuous. The story takes place in a beautiful setting from the 1930s (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson & Nancy Haigh) covered with a dark rainy exterior (snow on the ground). The wonderful Irish score of Thomas Newman is at the heart of the story and will only settle when necessary. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element of the film is the superb photography by Conrad L. Hall. It's one of the best cinematography I've ever seen. and I watch a lot of movies. The scene where Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago is quite impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car and reveals Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. He then walks to the side of the car to see Michael (Hoechlin) waking up and looking out the side window. As he continues, he sways to and from the sides, all around the car and reveals a beautiful scenic Chicago landscape of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and crew, the man principal creates a brazenly amazing movie. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (He won several awards) Before American Beauty, Mendes worked as a theater director for the British Theater, but decided he wanted to move on by saying that there was nothing new for him in the theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes distinguished himself in my book as one of the great directors (on a list of about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The film illuminates a genre of brazen that has successes and failures and expresses the true theme with brilliance. Photography, acting and history are phenomenal. I'm still waiting for the New York bands from Scorcesee, but for the moment, I'm quite sure to say it's the "best movie of the year". Considering it's a competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) it's a strong statement.
