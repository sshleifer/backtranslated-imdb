When "Girlfight" came out, critics praised it, but I did not move to see it. I finally saw it when it came out on video and I understood the rave reviews. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly get acquainted with Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez), a student. She has a big ass expression on her face and any idea about Diana that we could draw from this expression is soon corroborated when she gets into a fight. While Diana is in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive guy in her own right; We can not clearly blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But the film resumes its course as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind: boxing to escape this sinister existence. His older brother has already started boxing, but his father would probably not approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Only the first few minutes alone indicate that I'm about to shoot for a very non-Hollywood filmed film, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role claimed that. Even before they go to any boxing scene, you feel like you're smashing your head at the ugly life Diana lives on. And when they finally get to the main story of the movie, there is no turning back. <br /> <br /> In the end, I really recommend this film. I will admit that the use of boxing as a means of showing someone who tries to do something about himself is somehow a clich√© at the cinema for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby" ), but I still think they did it. a great job with that here. In fact, it could have brought the genre to its peak. Very well. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez got lost in Hollywood movies after this one.
