Although filmed on a site of the Florida National Guard, "Tigerland" reminded me of Fort Polk, Louisiana, firing ranges, maneuvering areas, deep water to the waist and everything in between. The movie was quite authentic and the characters were similar to those at my ACI in 1974. The difference between the year of Tigerland, 1971 and mine of 1974, is that all exercise sergeants and instructors knew they would not be going back to Vietnam, that was just about everything, so the training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. It was the forerunner of all our problems in the 1970s and 1980s, which I know for a fact, I stayed there until 2004. I never heard anyone talk about "Tigerland", but the army had realistic training villages in Vietnam located in different bases in the United States. Vietnam Veterans tell me that until 1972, Basic & AIT could be quite rough and tough, because the trainers were there and were mandated to train Vietnamese men to these skills, but this has not always been the case. An instructor sergeant in Polk and later one of my veteran non-commissioned officers in Vietnam, when we became instructors in a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss, told me that they could not do anything to prepare whoever it was and that people just needed to know for themselves. This film is high.
