I went in this movie without knowing anything about it and I ended up enjoying it. It lacked authenticity and credibility. Some of the things that the characters said and did were completely weird, and a lot of the script seemed to be ad-libbed (maybe it's Woody Allen's typical? Excuse my ignorance) but all the audience in the theater was laughing so strong. It was not even a joke in the movie, but a whole movie. The acting reminded me of Seinfeld, where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes - they are lame, but if you do not take the film too seriously, you can really appreciate the actors' humor. , not characters. If you are looking for a random movie and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
