The film cast a new angle in Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and shows how human he was. Gandhi was troubled in his relationship with Harilal and repeatedly mentioned it as a failure of his father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big complaint is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly not very charismatic in the movie. It could have been better played by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too much and he seemed to have been intentionally depicted negatively in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not really complete, it focuses only on the relationship of father and son. The rest is dimmed and is only used to display the duration and general settings of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is very nice if you remember it is not a complete picture.
