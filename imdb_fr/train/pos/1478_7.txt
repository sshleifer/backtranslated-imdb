I liked this film, even though halfway through I could tell who was the secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if it is based on a true story since it tells "real" people at the end of the film. I guess I'll have to look for it and let you know. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the state in which this happened? I think they settled in North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, states could have been changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> One would think that this man could have understood it as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
