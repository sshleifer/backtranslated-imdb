Another of those movies you hear about friends (... or IMDb). Not a lot of false notes in this one. I saw just about everything that happened in the story of a young girl fleeing a Tennessee stalemate in Florida, with all her material belongings in an old broken car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, makes false starts, but learns from them. I wondered why, why she had not leaned a little more on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her reasons, as it is. <br /> <br /> Just a good movie. The only thing I do not like about it, I think, is the title.
