This film is proof that Black Film is a persistent style and extremely worthy of staying alive. For me, it's the best example of a black movie since Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he will never have the recognition he deserves. He was never properly promoted on his first outing and had to build a group of listeners through venues such as Vanguard Cinema and reference sites for renter tenants. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend to people looking for something else entertainment to rent this movie and dive into its very complicated plot
