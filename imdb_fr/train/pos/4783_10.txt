"The Straight Story" is a beautiful film about an old man named Alvin Straight, who runs his lawnmower across the country to visit his dying brother, from whom he is separated. But this is just basic synapsis ... this movie is much more than that. It was Richard Farnworth's last role before his death, and it's definitely the one for which he will be remembered. He is a stubborn old man, not unlike many of the old men that you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their life. He will reach and touch a part of you, at least if you have a heart, that will be the case.
