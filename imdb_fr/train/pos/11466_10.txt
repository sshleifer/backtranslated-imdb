I was lucky to see Zero Day last night. It's an incredible movie. A very disturbing aspect. <br /> <br /> In a way, Zero Day is very similar to the "Blair Witch Project". It is completely filmed with portable camcorders. It is about 2 children. Just your average children. André and Calvin. They are launching a campaign against their high school called "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in the form of a video diary by the 2 children. This shows that their relationships with their parents, among other people, show that they are just normal children, just like people we know or have encountered. We discover that the last mission of Army of 2 will be called Zero Day. They plan to shoot in their high school. <br /> <br /> You see how they have access to their weapons, how they plan their operations, everything. They point out that the media did not affect them at all and that there is no reason to do so. As I said, all this is in the form of a video diary, and then the tapes are stored in a safe to be seen after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting is shown by means of Survillence cameras in the school. . Chilling indeed. The movie is very scary. Some of the things they say, how they plan, you just have to see it for yourself. A quote I remember is the only time Calvin is alone. He says, "André thinks we're going to go in a rescue car, which has taken him to many schools across the country, I do not know what he thinks about it, but the only way out of school is in a black plastic bag ". <br /> <br /> I probably will not even give you the idea of ​​this movie. You really need to see it yourself. It's all around the festivals right now. <br /> <br /> A +.
