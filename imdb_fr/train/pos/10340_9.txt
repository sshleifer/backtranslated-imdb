Even though this movie was released a year before my birth, it is without a doubt one of my favorite comedies. He represents Redd Foxx as a father trying to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know what it means to be gay and has all these stereotypical notions about what homosexuals are. His son, Norman, has grown up now and lives alone. When his father, Ben, discovers that his son is gay, he visits him in the hope of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines of the film: when Ben arrives at Norman's, he falls on a prostitute and thinks it's his son lying around ("Norman ... is that you?"). The movie made me laugh from start to finish. Redd Foxx is awesome. Although the content is largely stereotyped, I found nothing offensive about how the content was processed, and it even ends well. Highly recommended.
