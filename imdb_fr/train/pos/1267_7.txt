JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film that is sustained by strong performances and creative writing (albeit extremely predictable). Sean Connery is an anti-death penalty activist who was created to save a seemingly innocent black man (Blair Underwood) from the ultimate punishment. To remedy the situation, Connery ventures to the scene of the crime, where he must struggle not only with time, but also with a sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). The twists and turns of roles abound - some are surprising, others not - as the aging crusader tries to unravel the mystery. The culminating end is a bit ridiculous, but JUST CAUSE is worth a visit on a slow night.
