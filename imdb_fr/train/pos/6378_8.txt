Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best animated movies and intelligently written dialogue of any Disney movie I've seen. And I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. I particularly like the vocal work of Don Novello on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad the whole movie seems to move about twice as fast as it should, at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - that Atlantis does not provide. He is at best average. In the middle of the film, there is a mediocre twist. That's all. It's still a good movie. Everyone should check.
