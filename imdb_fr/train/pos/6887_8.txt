It's a unique and daring film. It's energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performance. <br /> <br /> I like directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inward, ask questions and dig under area. By the nature of the film, the viewer must also look within himself. It can take courage to do that. I can see how some people close to mind might find this rather disturbing. However, I found it challenging, more than just entertainment. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker with a vision. I am curious to see what he will do next. <br /> <br /> Look at him.
