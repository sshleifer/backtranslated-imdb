That's how I felt watching this movie. I liked it. It was hilarious. But I felt like I was getting a sneaky view into someone's psyche, and then I laughed when it got crooked to make an interesting point. A friend expressed it this way: <br /> <br /> "I feel as if we had burst into someone's house and now watched their terrible videos without their knowledge". <br /> <br /> Another of these facts is stranger than movie fictions. "Groovin 'Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a guy from a small town who comes to a nearby TV station hoping to shoot a movie - and he certainly does, but maybe not be, as he had originally planned. With high hopes for fame and meaning, he invites Harris to film a truly awesome talent quest he has organized in his hometown - featuring his own role number "Olivia Newton-Don". <br /> <br /> The director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this story that is evolving slowly. Some sequences of a clumsy kid who wants to be someone are transformed, after two subsequent reinterpretations, in the history of the absence of sexual identity repressed in a small American city. Harris simultaneously criticizes the attitudes of small American cities, the cult of celebrity and the operating practices of the film and television industry. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn and Grispin Glover both perform amazingly well. a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - he follows so closely the film "Gary", but with strong nuances given to push the direction of interaction as Harris wishes. <br /> <br /> In the end the wide-eyed naivete the original Gary is what moved me - as opposed to these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> A film not to be missed. I did not see anything like it. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
