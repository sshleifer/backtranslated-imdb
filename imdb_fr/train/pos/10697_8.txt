Modern, original and romantic history. <br /> <br /> Very good interpretation of Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman imitates a Russian accent with a lot of realism. Ben Chaplin is as good as the shy and dull clerk. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman is fantastic and very friendly. I forgot what beautiful woman she is. It is not hard to imagine that John falls in love with her. Some unexpected turnings in the story are good for the suspense. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was a surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good movie. <br /> <br /> The Netherlands: eight points.
