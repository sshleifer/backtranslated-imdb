To all who think that 1.This was a boring TV show 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars <br /> <br /> CLOSE THE F ** k Up !! It was one of the best Academy Awards, as it was a historic moment to see a "black yes" win the Best Actress award in the "Best Actress" category. To be honest, I had stopped looking at the awards of the academy because of the lack of diversity of laureates and nominees. For me, it was nothing, but a group of whites caressing each other in the back. Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but that was not the case. academy whose majority is composed of white voters yeah yeah Nicole kidman sang very well at red muling! but it was time for the blacks to be welcomed into these shows. For all those who think that race is not a "probably white" problem in the film industry, many of the most talented black actresses have been reduced to the stereophonic style created by whites. think is a black woman or are not the existence "Angela basset". I do not expect many whites to understand any of this because they never had to deal with it. Come to think about it, it is they who inflicted it.
