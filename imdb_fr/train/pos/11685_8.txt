I found this film really funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to earth in a body of white men in their mid-fifties. He does not realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as before. He listens to rap music, sings and plays the stereotypical role of an urban black man. The real humor in this movie was to look at the problems that this behavior was causing him with the black community.
