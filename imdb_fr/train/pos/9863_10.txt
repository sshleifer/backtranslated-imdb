I thought Ice Age was a great movie! As a 30-year-old woman without children, it seems to me that I still love these humorous and spiritual animated films. Sid is the best character I've seen in a while, better than Bartok at Anastasia (although he was really funny, and I did not think his character could be equaled or even beaten) and even funnier than Melman in Madagascar. I saw the film at least 15 times (I obviously own it) and I quote it at work (several times ... yes, anyway). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to understand what the squirrel is trying to tell them about "tigers" ... "A pack of wolves, a pack of bears, a pack of fleas, a pack of whiskers, a wafer of nose, a bundle of dermis? " pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a punch, pack of birds, pack of flying fish ... "or whatever the game! It's THE funniest part of the whole movie, even if I also enjoyed the humor behind "putting the lazy on the map" and many other parts.The only animated film that can be compared to Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
