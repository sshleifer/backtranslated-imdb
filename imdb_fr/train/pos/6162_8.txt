I loved this masterpiece and, frankly, me too, I found Mary Poppins (although I like Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) stupid and sacred. Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I do not know why people think this movie is distorted. It was magical and it was very fun to watch. Each scene had a certain charm to better know the characters. You really see how this small, close-knit family learns to bond, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was at "The Age of not Believing". Mary Poppins may be more popular and cherished by others, but this gem will be the one I will always love and cherish.
