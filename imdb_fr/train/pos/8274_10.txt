This film is excellent. I found it very interesting. I thought the legend of Wendigo was pretty cool. The acting was also great, as were the costumes, the production, the photography, the staging and the screenplay. <br /> <br /> A very happy family, on vacation, is stuck in the middle of nowhere after hitting a deer. A hunter then appears and is very angry and outraged by the fact that one of the deer's antlers is broken. He begins to hunt down the family and strange things begin to happen to them. <br /> <br /> See this movie. It's worth it. Congratulations to the actors, the team and the filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!
