I really liked this show - we had the first and only, it seems, a UK series on channel 4. The characterization was right on the money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all Different facets of the population of a small town were represented. <br /> <br /> There was no way to laugh - I had never seen this in an American TV comedy except for Larry Sanders and it worked really well here, which reinforces the suggestion that these zany cops were really like that, not just for the cameras. <br /> <br /> In the end, a small odd number that tickles me completely: I can not help thinking that it may have missed the mark some public. I think it would have been a cult hit in the UK if it had been aired at a convenient time. <br /> <br /> I will end this with my usual comment: Where the hell can I get to watch again? Ideas?
