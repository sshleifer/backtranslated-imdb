By a happy coincidence in the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock's mesmerizing masterpiece, "Vertigo", they also directed this light comedy. Maybe both actors should do it after suffering the heaviness of the film Hitchcock. Anyway, this is a great companion to "Vertigo", who is once again exploring a very unlikely but powerful novel. In fact, the film can be seen as the reverse of "Vertigo" with its happy ending. Here again, Novak undergoes a transformation. In Vertigo, she essentially plays two women and the "transforms" from witch to mortal. Stewart is again bewitched and tormented for a time by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two characters come together in "Bell Book and Candle", a perfect antidote for Hitcock. Once again, the dynamics of love and attraction are examined, but in a completely different order of ideas. The casting is great. Lemmon is hilarious as a demon brother of Novak and Elsa Lancaster giving a classic performance as an aunt. Ernie Kovacs as an alcoholic cult writer and of course Hermoine Gingold playing Novak's rival are all excellent. The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is a comedy at its best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you have not already seen it should see this memorable light comedy.
