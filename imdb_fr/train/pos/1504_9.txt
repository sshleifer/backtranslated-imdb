Four great stories of master Robert Bloch, adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early 70s, are the basis of this excellent production of Amicus. It was a very popular movie genre from the '60s to the mid' 70s and is one of my favorite horror movies. This one in particular shines for the episode Sweets to the Sweet, where Christopher Lee is hunted by his diabolical little girl, heir to the tradition of his mother. The other three episodes (the last of which is a little comical, but with the terrific addition of Ingrid Pitt, the most famous vampress of English cinema) are also very funny from the beginning to the end, and good to very good.
