It's a great Amicus horror anthology, with 3 beautiful stories and fantastic performances !, Only the latest story disappoints. All the characters are great, and the movie is rather stunning, but Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just amazing! It's very underrated and my favorite story should be the 3rd "Sweets To The Sweet", and all the characters are very friendly. Some of these predictions are predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and rather bland, but the end was really cool! This is a great Amicus horror anthology, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the latest story disappoints!, I say it's up to see! <br /> <br /> 1st story ("Method for Murder"). It's a great story, with a lot of suspense, and the Dominic killer is really scary, and it's played very well too! It was the perfect way to start a story, and for the most part, it's unpredictable, plus the end of the double twist is shocking and scary! Grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd story. ( "Waxworks"). It's a solid story all around, with great performance, but the end is pretty predictable, but it's still scary and a little suspenseful, Peter Cushing did an amazing job, and I could not believe how much Joss Ackland was young. , I really liked this story !. Grade B <br /> <br /> 3rd story ("Sweets Ã  la douce"). This is the best story here because it is extremely scary and unpredictable, it also has a beautiful twist! Christopher Lee did a great job and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as a girl. The end is quite shocking! I do not want to ruin it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4th story ("The cape"). It's a terrible story, really weak and not very funny. Jon Pertwee annoyed me, but his end surprised me a little, and Ingrid Pitt was great, as always, but she was dull and has been many times, not to mention creativity. ??. Grade D <br /> <br /> The direction is good! Peter Duffell does a great job here, with awesome camera work, optimal viewing angles, a goosebump atmosphere and an extremely fast movie! <br /> <br /> The shooting is great! John Bryans is great here. As a narrator, he had excellent lines. I just wish I had more time on the screen. John Bennett is very good as a Det., And was quite intense, he was particularly good in the end!, I loved him very much. Denholm Elliott is excellent like Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very friendly and I liked his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is incredibly beautiful!, And did very well what she had to do as a woman, she also had excellent chemistry with Denholm Elliott !. Tom Adams is incredibly scary as Dominic, he looked scary and he did the job extremely well! Peter Cushing is amazing as always, and here he is friendly, focused, charming and has always had a lot of class! (Cushing rules !!). Joss Ackland is fantastic as always, and seemed so young here, I hardly recognized him, his accent was not so thick and I played a different role, I loved it! (Ackland Rules). Wolfe Morris is scary here, and did what he had to do well. The Christopher Lee is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is incredibly intense, very focused and, as always, he had such an intense and intense look, he was particularly amazing at the end! (Lee Rules !!). Chloe Franks is adorable as a girl, she is a bit scary and has given one of the best children's shows I've ever seen !, I loved her. Ny Dawn Porter is beautiful and was excellent as a baby- sitter, I loved him a lot! Jon Pertwee annoyed me here, and was pretty bland, and completely unusual, he had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and does her usual vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> The rest of the distribution is going very well. Overall, you have to see! **** out of 5
