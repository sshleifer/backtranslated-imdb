Philo Vance had a lot of affinities with Bulldog Drummond ?? He was a gentleman with the kind of polish and elegance that is generally associated with the British upper classes and he was also independently wealthy ?? <br /> <br /> But there were vital differences ?? Drummond was an adventurer, charming, gallant, lively? Vance could be pompous, a little dull and honest? There was a hint of basic cruelty in his attitude ?? <br /> <br /> "The case of the murder of a kennel" is the most impressive of the 14 Vance films made between 1929 and 1947 ?? The story of a murdered collector of Chinoiserie, it contains all the ingredients of the mystery of the classic private eye ?? exotic frame in the Long Island Kennel Club's blue nose, three murders to be solved by Vance, including a confusing "closed-door murder", the key to the whole affair and many suspects? <br /> <br /> Usually, a crime novel scenario has proved too static and talkative to make persuasive films, even if they work pretty well on the printed page, but in this case the Michael Curtiz's direction and editing quality give the film an urgency look that makes it quite different from similar films of this type ?? <br /> <br /> The elegance and suavity of William Powell made him the perfect Vance and, although a year later, he changed studio, he stayed in the same genre with the very popular hit "The Thin Man" at MGM ??
