What are the chances of a "Mermaid" helium balloon coming from Yuba City (California) (November 8, 1993) and landing 4 days later (November 12) at MERMAID, Prince Edward Island , in Canada (approximately 4000 miles). It's a good movie. It is based on a true story. This film helps not only the children cope with the losses, but also the elderly. I hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Rhonda
