I thought the film was pretty good for a TV movie, and it contained a lot of action and humor at the same time. I found that the entertainment was worth watching, and I would watch it again or a similar show. I am disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I see a possibility for a series of action based on this concept or a sequel with Sean playing again for higher bids, anyway, his life would be back to the rendezvous. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that Sean played the role very well and reminded me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux in Days of Our Lives - the Soap Opera.
