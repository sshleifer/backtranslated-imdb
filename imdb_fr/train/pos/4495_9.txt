Outside the home, the world is different and the family is struggling to cross the dividing line between father's authority and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period is captured; Bakelite light swithes, Georgian floor, picture rails, wallpaper, short skirts, cheeky kids, mini van, modern and shiny mangles .... <br /> <br /> Location is capture; Rocky landscape dug in the glacier, local stone walls, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more than that; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deception, machismo, morals, maturity, loss, poverty sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenthood are all there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as current as ever. The fact that some of them are not addressed directly reflects the attitudes of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testament to acting, history and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is anything wrong with this film, it's because all this deeply rooted and wonderfully played tension is swept a little too much at the end. Maybe I do not understand well - the sadness felt by many teenagers really disappears if they treat him (**) - maybe the movie tries to send even this message too - it's worth it be done. <br /> <br /> Does the film try to say? Children: the parents were young too, the parents too. Everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, the fight can end happily. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> That sounds simplistic, does not it? The film sometimes feels like the same but then you notice everything that is challenged and discovered. The film is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the problems themselves.
