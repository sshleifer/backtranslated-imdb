I rarely sit in front of the television especially to watch a particular program. It's even rarer when I finally enjoy the program, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells is one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A remarkable cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, and an excellent, witty and poignant storyline combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can not really say how good I thought it was, so I will not try, I will just say that if you get the chance, PLEASE SEE IT !!!! I just hope it will come out on video.
