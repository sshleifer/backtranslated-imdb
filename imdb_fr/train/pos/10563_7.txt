Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. The 30s are a decade with a lot of movies of all types that I can imagine, especially at the beginning of the conversation phase. There were films that are painfully static and bland, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there are some that do not rest, sometimes in good and other ways. It's one of the movies that does not stop for a minute, and it's both a wonder and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street", was to be the king of Era Depression's musicals, and he was probably excited about the possibilities of sound in the film world because he filled the picture. There must not be a full minute without music or people talking. This is completely crazy! I thought the film deserved a 5 (or a 6), because the pace was very poor, because it was incredibly fast and I sometimes did not know what was happening and what to think. The characters just seemed to run from place to place, talking about things that did not interest me and probably no one else. I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also played the female lead in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and that "42nd Street" was a film whose ending was the best part. And you know what? It happened the same with "Footlight Parade"! The end is absolutely amazing! It has become, without a doubt, the most impressive musical I have ever seen. The last part presents us some musical numbers and these deserve, besides, to see the rest of the film. The numbers are flawless! There are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second. Suddenly, the screen was filled with beautiful and inventive camera work, beautiful people and simple entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
