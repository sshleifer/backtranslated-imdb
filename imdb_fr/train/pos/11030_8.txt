Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic of the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as "Die Hard in a / on a." Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on a mountain" and pretty good for what it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, who are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms, Cliffhanger gives up the closed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking scenery which, in their immensity, threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts between the peoples fighting and dying between the summits. <br /> <br /> Years before other films like A Simple Plan and Cliffhanger's director, Renny Harlin, recognized the visual impact of the juxtaposition of brutal violence and hard struggles to survive in a natural environment cold and indifferent. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has already received a lot of praise. all it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and actors and simply to believe that what we are seeing is really happening. Even Harlin's plan showing the falling stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective, but still threatens to become a joke (and it repeats in Deep Blue Sea), or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face, can not mitigate the power of the sequence. <br /> <br /> The next awesome play is shooting and flying aboard the jet. As Stallone and Michael France wrote and under Harlin's direction, the public is immersed in the action by not knowing which agents are involved in the flight and which are not: the double bloody crosses are totally unexpected. As noted by Roger Ebert, the stuntman who flew between planes deserves special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists / robbers seems to fall down the wall of snow at the bottom of the mountain. As far as I know, nobody was killed during the making of this film (a small miracle, given the extreme nature of some waterfalls), so it is obvious that a manikin was used for the filming. But the picture itself is impressive, because we wonder how Harlin (or probably one of the directors of the second unit) knew exactly where to place the camera. <br /> <br /> I'll take Sly Stallone as my Action Hero, any day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars I've ever seen to be completely convincing in as a person who can bear a lot of physical and emotional pain, while actually feeling that pain. The role of Gabe Walker perfectly complements the strengths of acting: he embodies an older and more vulnerable hero, offering an incredibly discrete performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself. <br /> <br /> Unlike Stallone's Walker is an ordinary man become a hero without paranormal abilities or improved by computer. At Cliffhanger, the hero almost dies of cold, and his clothes begin to cry, while he hardly escapes one dangerous situation after another. He moans when he is touched and bleeds when he is injured, especially in the cave sequence where he takes a Rocky Fuss from one of the naughty crazy dogs. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the really despicable villains actually contributes to the effectiveness of the film: when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I was looking for the good guys to each step of the process and anticipated when another bad guy would bite the dust (or rather the ice); At one point, I was hailed as one of the bloodiest characters in the film that deserved a violent death. <br /> <br /> Lithgow's British accent is as unconvincing as the model's casual model or helicopter, but he's basically a good actor, and one of the few to be able to recite a silly dialogue perfectly : In a scene, watching his hostages Stallone and Rooker, trying to decide what tasks to give them, he actually says "You, stay! You, go get!" Even a better actor, like Anthony Hopkins, might have had problems with this line. <br /> <br /> Even if Cliffhanger sometimes casts credibility aside, he does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show. <Br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, for example, Lithgow says openly to one of his men: "Retire [Stallone] when he comes down." No real criminal brain would have made this mistake, even unconsciously: his recklessness allows Rooker to send a warning to Sly on the rock, triggering a fierce fight between Stallone and the bad guys who are trying to pull him down. the rope tied to his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could have given his order in more subtle ways, but the sequence might not have been as amusing to watch if Rooker had not had the opportunity to openly challenge him the arrogance of his captor. <br /> <br /> Much like a series of Saturday mornings or (sometimes) a Western film, Cliffhanger is built on solid foundations that allow it to resist weak elements sapped a lower quality film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned above, the weak moments include some scenes shot on inexpensive interior decks with real dummy snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem useless in a story already loaded action. Finally, Harlin's decision to shoot some scenes of death in slow motion seems futile, as the technique does not contribute anything to the scene. <br /> <br /> Too bad Stallone is now too old for action movies, because his character in this film seems so credible that I inevitably wonder what it would look like years later. But it may be better for Cliffhanger to be left alone, with no follow-up: there are already enough tired and obsolete film franchises. There was an unofficial suite called itself Vertical Limit: compared to this clinker, Cliffhanger is in the list of the top 250 IMDb records. <br /> <br /> Note: 8 (Very good, especially considering most of Stallone's other films.)
