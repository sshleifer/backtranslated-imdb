From time to time, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a film like "The Golden Child", in particular. It's a film that could play Harrison Ford, Kurt Russell or other characters. But Eddie really works. he is intelligent, he is funny, he is brave, kind, courteous, economical, clean and all that a hero should be. <br /> <br /> Have been chosen to protect a mystical child who holds the key to protect the world from everything. Diabolic (perfectly embodied by Dance), Eddie travels to California, Nepal and vice versa, while the handsome Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if he is all he says and that a mad old man (Wong , perfect as always) knows that he is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, breathtaking in places, shocking and, of course, funny. Eddie is the only action hero I know who can start a movie by making derogatory remarks behind a guy who reads a porn magazine and ending with clever remarks about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "Child": it's a "golden" discovery. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
