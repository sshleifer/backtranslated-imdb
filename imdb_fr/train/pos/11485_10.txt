Zero Day makes you think, or even ask yourself, why two boys / young men would do what they did - commit suicide by slaughtering their classmates. It captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own world / mutual through coupled destruction. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect film, but given the money / time available to the filmmaker and actors - it's a remarkable product. Explaining the motivations and actions of the two young assassins / suicides is better than "Elephant" - as a movie that runs under our "rationalist" skin, it's a much better movie than almost anything you're likely to see. <br /> <br /> Defective but honest with terrible honesty.
