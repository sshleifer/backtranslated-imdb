Wow I loved this movie! This is normal life in a small village. Hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Awesome! These are things everyone meets in life. You must do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and "what neighbors will think" more important than following their hearts. Do not let anyone's opinion stop you from realizing your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors are all very normal people, it could have been my family. No great beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the movie.
