Other commentators have detailed (or better) as much as possible the plot, the social parables and the comments, but I would like to associate myself with my admiration for this gem of a movie. He is doing well more than 50 years later in all categories - screenplay, acting, photography, scenography, sound design ... it's really a classic. It was my first experience with the "young" Alec Guinness, and from the first pictures, it was obvious that what made him so special that he was finally classified as a knight. <br /> <br /> I only give him an "8" because it is a rather light parable that examines human nature but does not really blur it; and because the intrigue is the easy solution in the end, rather than actually solving the conflict between the inventor and the millers and the millers who chase him all over the city. In addition, a few minutes of reflection reveal the fundamental flaw of the logic of the scenario: wear is almost never the determining factor for the purchase of new clothes (especially dressed clothes); children grow up, people change size, gain and lose weight, and follow the latest fashions all the time, as long as the looms have been expanded. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would make a fortune by providing indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> Still, it's a very good movie. If you have the chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should do it.
