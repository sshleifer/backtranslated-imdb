At the beginning of the film, we watch May and Toots prepare for their trip to London to visit their adult children. It can be seen that Toots is not in very good health, but he continues. When he suddenly dies, May's world begins to lose control. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Roger Michell, based on a play played on screen by Hanif Kureshi, is a study of the relationship between this maternal figure with his new status in life and his awakening in a world where she did not even know he existed until now. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban wife was probably boring. Obviously, his sex life was almost nil. We learn that she had a small extramarital affair and nothing at all. When May loses her husband, she can not go home. She remains in the care of her grandson at her daughter's house. It is in this context that May begins to covet Darren, the young and tough occasional lover of his daughter. <br /> <br /> Darren wakes up in May, a passion she has never known. May responds by transforming herself before our eyes. May, who at the beginning of the film is skinny, suddenly begins to dress, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. She ends up falling head over heels with this young man who satiates a passion she has never felt before. <br /> <br /> After experiencing a few similar cases to this story, it did not surprise me. watch the reaction of May. His own chance to have a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends up being frustrating for May, who realizes how great his sex is with Darren. We think the young man is only interested in this case and the possibility of extorting money from May. Finally, the girl, Helen, discovers what Mom did behind her back when she discovered her mother's erotic paintings. <br /> <br /> The film is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings a lot to May's role. Daniel Craig is also amazing. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also essential in the story because it is she who has to confront the mother about what is happening behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small role as Bruce, the old man of Helen's class, and he is quite efficient. <br /> <br /> The film is rewarding for those who will see it with an open mind. <br /> <br />
