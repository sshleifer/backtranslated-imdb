This game was really great and quite difficult. It has a fantastic and phantasmagorical story and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all Horror fans and it is very captivating from start to finish. The only problem with this game is that I wish I had more weapons but it's just me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br />>
