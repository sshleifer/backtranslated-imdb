"Bell Book and Candle" has been shown recently on cable. Not having seen this for a moment, we decided to take another look at this comedy. Based on James Van Druten's Broadway hit, a vehicle of Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early 1950s, the movie was adapted to the movies by Daniel Taradash. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the piece into a delightful comedy. <br /> <br /> Obviously, judging by some comments submitted by IMDb, the big problem seems to be the twinning of the two stars, who had collaborated on "Vertigo", published the same year. Spectators did not think about the difference in age when the film was released. In fact, most of the aging male stars of this period were still associated with much younger women. <br /> <br /> Filming the film in Manhattan at Christmas is a delightful comedy that has delighted viewers. Kim Novak lived up to her beauty because it was clear that the camera adored her, no matter what she was playing. As a witch who becomes human, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays Shep 'Henderson, is also at his best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows here why he was at the top. <br /> <br /> The wonderful Elsa Lanchester, playing Queenie, is a precious addition to any movie, as she proves it here. Nicky Holroyd of Jack Lemmon, Gillian's brother, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also considered the writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
