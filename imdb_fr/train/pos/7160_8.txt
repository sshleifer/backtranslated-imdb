A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be rewarded for its efforts. "Holes" does not make the same mistakes that one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teens placed in a camp. For the first time, events are not explained in detail. Backtracking scenes really serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first, the seriousness of the film shocked me a bit. But I soon realized that we had to endure these moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this film also questions some of the methods used in correctional institutions. (An example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes to create a character, as learning to read would not help that). "Holes" is a smart and beautiful movie. To watch absolutely!
