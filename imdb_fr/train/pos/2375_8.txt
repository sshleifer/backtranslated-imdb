Honestly, I think it was the best version of the war of the worlds I've ever seen. it was funny but it was also educational I learned a lot about the movie and if I could, I would do it with this movie. My favorite part was when the soldiers were killed on one robot and another came right behind. in the last world film war I think it should have been more like the first and it would have been better. but anyway, I give this movie 2 inches. <br /> <br /> and if they want to make another film like this, I'll definitely watch it. <br /> <br /> thank you
