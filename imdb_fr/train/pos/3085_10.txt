I watched the unpublished episodes online and was so sad that the show did not come back anymore. He had the best cast of mature and talented actors and incredible chemistry. It seemed that all the actors were personal friends in real life. Towards the end of the show, the show became attractive, sexy and very watchable. Of course, some stories are not realistic, so what ... All the characters are nice and you're looking for them. The show reminded me of a cross between 2 other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Congratulations to all the actors. Note to ABC Directors - Nielsen ratings reports do not show you real results. The audience of the show will record it mainly. I was very disappointed with the big networks that flooded us with reality shows or teen shows. Why have mature material, thoughtful and well played, we have to switch to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online. New broadcast media will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
