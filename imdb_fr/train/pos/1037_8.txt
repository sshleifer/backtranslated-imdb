"A thief is often a man who left something unfinished, but not always the one who did something." - The Emperor Marc Aur√®le <br /> <br /> The DVD of "Watch on the Rhine" could not have come at a better time. It restores a major game of Lillian Hellman, adapted to the screen and agitated by Dashiell Hammett (the audio commentary of the Hellman scholar Bernard F. Dick confirms his authorship). It presents a subtle performance by Bette Davis, who assumed a moderate secondary role long after she became the queen of the workhorse of the Warner Bros. lot. Equally significantly, it reminds us that the Second World War had a purpose. <br /> <br /> Of course, you say we needed that. In "Destination Tokyo" (1943), Cary Grant talked about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We have seen boots trample the living hills in "The Sound of Music" (1965). We visited a devious England occupied by Germany in "It Happened Here" (1966). Yet, to tell the truth, the message must always be broadcast. <br /> <br /> I have an 81 year old friend who regularly curses Franklin Roosevelt. He feels that FDR dragged the United States into a foreign fight that we did not need and that caused the death of his favorite cousin. He is encouraged by Patrick Buchanan to demonize Allied leaders and trivialize the Second World War. <br /> <br /> The political editorialist has just published a voluminous book containing detailed research which asserts that Adolf Hitler would have posed no other danger. in Poland, in Europe or in the world, if only the Third Reich had ceded the free city of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan argues that if these selfish Poles had not clashed with the Nazis, foolishly taking inspiration from Britain and altruistic France, a vertigo would have engulfed the West. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would have built a gas chamber to bring a final solution to the Jewish problem. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this site believe that "Watch" is sinking under the weight of stale propaganda. May be. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seems to have understood the meaning of the film: some people were wounded and killed to seize the land, property and the freedom of others; such people dominated the Axis powers and "enough" did not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he had won. He and Bette Davis put a convincing passion into their portraits of refugees fighting oppressors. They give an emotional punch to the intellectual argument that he is withdrawing from the sidelines, actively confronting torturers and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman did not like Lukas as a person since he remained apolitical. Of course, as a Hungarian, he had seen with his own eyes the bloody "dictatorship of the proletariat" Bela Kun replace an old-fashioned empire, then switch to the right-wing tyranny of Admiral Horthy. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful cameo role added In Hammett's play, Henry Daniell sardonically portrays an officer of the Wehrmacht class who disdains the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would probably be alongside Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the July 20 plot against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he pragmatically supported the Nazi cause, though he insulted Mr. Blecher "the butcher" and scorned the Romanian aristocrat Teck de Brancovis for attempting to peddle information about a clandestine ruler. <br /> <br /> Teak, a poor and a possible cuckold, wants money and a visa to return to Europe where he can take back the shreds of a life that had collapsed with the Great War tearing empire and the world's largest economic depression. He has no political conviction, no scruples about exchanging a freedom fighter for his own future. George Coulouris, a graduate of the Mercury Theater, confers on the cynicism of the old world of this exhausted business a point of desperate threat. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives a seductive vitality to the housewife of the man, a dominatrix old lady who knows her mind and takes her way - but who does not appreciate enough her children and their achievements in outside the home she controls. She and her son in the pale office belong to the American version of the privileged genre of von Ramme and Brancovis. However, this family has not seen the ruin and will never do it. They are rich people who could silently advance the evil simply by not opposing it. <br /> <br /> This mother and her son could easily make choices that reflect this complacency towards National Socialism and fascism that is flourishing today in the Buchanan pundit. "Watch on the Rhine" has a well-maintained period look. His dialogue reflects his scholarly origins on the stage rather than ringing fresh in the street. Still, Hellman and Hammett's film has a guts-based power. The public always needs to hear and consider his call to arms against the hoarders relentlessly during the march.
