Considering its budget is low, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with surprisingly satisfactory effects. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a family about to switch to solar energy. - a motor home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it destroyed - by motorcycle vandals, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, and so on. And it is only recently that the light of the explosion of a star has caused the appearance of extremely unusual auroras in the desert sky. Thus, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, is faced with strange extraterrestrial forces that have placed them in a time-space conversion chain. <br /> <br /> Mix of 2001 Elements: ODYSSÃ‰E DE ESPACE AND ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD GENRE, THE END DAY, despite its obvious flaws and uneven playing, remains interesting because of David Allen's great special effects . The scenery of the desert is perfect for close encounters of this film. and although the film can not really be compared with Kubrick or Spielberg's films, THE DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other imitations of 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. I would like to thank the director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS of 1977 was an interesting precursor for ARACHNOPHOBIA, for at least one attempt - and on that basis, I give THE DAY TIME ENDED 7.
