Wow, this movie was absolutely great. I really do not know why everyone says the pace is slow. I thought the rhythm was perfect. The film is about Michael Sullivan played with perfection by Tom Hanks, who is a kind of hit-man / killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this job but does it because Rooney paid for his house and helped him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children are not aware that it is his job and when we witness a murder in cold blood, he is placed in an uncomfortable position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and wants revenge. They steal aban√©es and much more and create a link. They are the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as well as Jude Law who plays his scary role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and shows greatly how the 1930s were.
