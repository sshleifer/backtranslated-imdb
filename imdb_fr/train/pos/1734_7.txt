I just saw this movie for the first time and I liked it. His dance was very funny. I read somewhere that she had the role in this movie because she knew how to dance. The scenery was great too. Yvonne is a woman so talented and beautiful. We laughed at scenes of stupid kisses, but that's what's great in old movies! I grew up with her in the Munsters and I like to watch her in her previous films. They may not all be the best there, but they still deserve to be watched to see her play and sing. I buy all his movies slowly and watch them while I receive them. I have a large collection of his memories.
