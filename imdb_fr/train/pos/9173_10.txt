I think it's a good version, I've been here before, to help me find the version I had to use and I went to Jane Eyre 1983, I read a comment from users and Then, I helped to get this version. I do not regret having chosen this version and you either. I tried to look at all the other versions and none corresponded, there is nothing like the book, and trust me, if you read the book, you want something that will fit that. When you are looking for something real and moving after reading the book, it's difficult because you want something that will fit that. I would say that God personally led me to this version. It points to true love for humans. I would say that God's love is greater. If there is anything better, I would like to see it. but so far there is none like that!
