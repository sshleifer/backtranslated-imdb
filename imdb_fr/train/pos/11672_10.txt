Excellent pirate entertainment! It contains all the ingredients necessary to hold the attention - a captivating story of intrigue, a fiery pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) attracted by the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) on a secret mission. of his own. They form a beautiful romantic couple on the screen - a sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is the bad guy, the bad pirate who weaves his ugly network of division and conquest. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role in the role of Mrs. MacGregor, protector of the young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> The landscape, the ships and the bay are beautifully filmed. . A lot of action also sword fights, naval battles, jumps Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). In an interview with Maureen O'Hara, the redhead herself stated that she boasted of having excellent whip control and that she could also outperform Flynn in saber fighting at the time, but that it would be useless to put it to the test here. <br /> <br /> Very nice film.
