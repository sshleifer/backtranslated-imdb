I gave him a 10 out of 10 points. I love him so much. I am a child of the 80s and totally in heavy metal for many years. These are the reasons why I love this film so much. It's so cool to see these posters in this boy's room (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted, sister ...) and his collection of vinyls (unveiling the evil Exciter, Rise of mutants from Impal and Killing, shock metal master) is my business by Megadeth). In addition, the soundtrack FASTWAY is totally incredible and fits very well in the plot. If you like metal, then TRICK OR TREAT is your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for a few seconds, watch it because the soundtrack and story will take you back to the glory of the 80s. You will not be the same person anymore.
