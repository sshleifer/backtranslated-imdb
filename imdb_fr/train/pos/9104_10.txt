Well, I do not agree with the other posted comment. Piedras is much better than Magnolia or one of the other films mentioned. <br /> <br /> Specially about non-real characters, I think someone just wrote this just because he never lived in Spanish society as I did (and I I'm not Spanish), is a very real movie with real characters, very well done by one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> about a European film as opposed to an American film, well we, different companies, personally, I do not really like modern American movies (I like classic movies and some American movies of Andy but they are very few). <br /> <br /> Is a film about the continued Constitution of a person, loved or not, we all make mistakes, but some can learn about mistakes.
