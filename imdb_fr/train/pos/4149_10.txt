While reading some of the comments on the bulletin boards here, I was expecting this movie to be a total disappointment - but when I looked at it, I could not help but laugh! It officially became my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what everyone hates, maybe because a film like this has never really existed before. I can not name another female comedy. Many comedies will have one or two actresses in mind, but there will be many male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett's brief appearance - and it worked. All the actresses have delivered very entertaining performances (especially Missi Pyle) from an original and adorable scenario. <br /> <br /> The charm of this film seems to me to be in its subtle feminist message: to accept who you are, women's success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and the breaking of gender roles. However light, each of the main characters faces a challenge as their attempts to be more "funny" are in conflict with their feminist values ​​and with whom they knew themselves. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle has proposed that this The film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and the absence of a renowned actor to get the studios behind, and I am 'agreement. All the people I recommended this film liked it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating the feminine dorkiness has not been widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open-minded movie or a love of women-centered comedy.
