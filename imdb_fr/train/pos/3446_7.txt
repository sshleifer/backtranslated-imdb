Yesterday, I attended the world premiere of "Descent" at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had a good time. It was complete and brought together all the major stars, including fellow countryman Marcus Patrick. <br /> <br /> I give the film 7.5 out of 10 possible starts. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Maya (Rosario Dawson) in college. You can imagine a typical university environment with wild parties and flirtors. The photography in this film was excellent. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they fall in love. It looks like any other relationship at the beginning. The man is in search of the attention and the affection of the woman and the woman plays with difficulty. Both played well. Flirt very innocent between the two. He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart. <br /> <br /> The apartment is very dark and dark. They end up in the basement extremely dark and lit by many candles. It actually reminded me of a dungeon. This is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her. This is a very dark and gritty rape scene. This scene is not made for young people or for the weak. The rape scene is a bit long and hard to take, but it is necessary for the rest of the film that follows. <br /> <br /> Maya is now starting to lose her soul in the face of drugs and sex. She falls into her own abyss. She starts attending the craziest parties and wakes up one morning in a room without remembering how she got there. He is told to go see Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this character is that they say, "It's the person who saves anyone who needs to be saved." He initiated Maya into drugs. They begin a relationship of dependence that comes later in the film. The club scenes at this stage of the film are photographed with extreme expertise. I thought they were well done and I noticed that the director of photography was applauded by the public at the end of the screening. <br /> <br /> Maya is back in college as a technical assistant and her class - Jared her rapist !! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya's face. What should I do?? What am I doing next ?? The gunshots of his face and his emotions are priceless. <br /> <br /> What happens next is not what happens. She is interested in Jared. She seems to be trying to revive the relationship and become darling again. I was sitting there saying that it could really happen. It was not. Nothing is further from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites him to his apartment and, of course, he introduces himself. Now, his apartment is dark and gritty. She does it completely undress. He thinks he's going to have "luck". She teases him just as any woman can. She caresses him everywhere and he gets angry. Note: For anyone thinking of watching this movie, this scene is a frontal nudity - may not be suitable for the youngest viewer. <br /> <br /> She then reverses the situation and becomes the beast and begins to rape. him. Once again, the scene is dark, sandy and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the movie and you do not want to know what's going on, skip this paragraph and go to the last one. paragraph. <br /> <br /> This is where Adrian returns to the picture. Maya asks Adrian to save her (?) By doing an extremely violent sex with Jared. She thinks it's the final revenge. Adrian continues to take all of Jared's manhood and stripped of his dignity. Marcus, like Adrian, plays this scene as believable as anyone else. He is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out on the screen. After the film, during a question-and-answer session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad. Maya thinks this revenge will save her but I do not think so. One of the final scenes has a close-up of Mays face and you see a tear roll on her cheek. It was a fabulous close-up scene and evokes the constant discussion of whoever is going to see this film. Did she have the revenge she wanted ?? Was it as good as she expected? In my opinion, this is not the case. It only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film, it will play well the role played, and I recommend it to all those who would like to see it. I would be just a little hesitant if I am under 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus must be congratulated for the job well done. Direction and photography must also be commended. It was a night that I enjoyed.
