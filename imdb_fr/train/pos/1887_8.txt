Arthur is a rich middle-aged kid who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says everything that goes through his head. He likes to brag about his wealth and knows he is a spoiled kid. He spends money on people he does not know and finds everything funny. Arthur has to marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune, but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird). <br /> <br /> It's a damn funny movie. I watched this movie because a very famous Indian movie 'Sharabee' is based on the character of Arthur. Although "Sharabee" is really inspired by "Arthur", I think they are two different movies. "Arthur" is just fun. It's very cheesy sometimes. There are so many fantastic linings in the movie. It's not a riot of laughter, but there are fantastic moments. My favorite scene is where Arthur meets his fiance's father and continues to talk about "moose". Duddley Moore certainly has a comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks about a "small" country to a couple sitting in the hotel and continues to talk to her husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud won an Oscar for this film. I do not know this actor. I do not think he did a good job, but maybe if I looked at more of his work, I might agree in the future. The film has some flat spots but not very long. can not wait to watch more.
