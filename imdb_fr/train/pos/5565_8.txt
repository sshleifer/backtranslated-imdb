I'm a fan of C & C, coming back to their records, and I love this movie. However, at one point, in the mid-1980s, on cable television in San Jose, California, it was broadcast with a secondary scenario line film. All references to marijuana have been replaced by "diamonds". The bag that "Red" drops in Chong contains diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation is still the same ("... it's worth ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a sub-plot in which clips of strangers on a ship have been added, observing C & C and discussing among themselves the obtaining of diamonds. In the end, instead of "space coke", it's something else. I do not know who created this version, but it was horrible and it was obvious that they were trying to make it compatible with family and children. It would have been better if this network had not broadcast it at all.
