THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - TV show of all time <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it would be a stupid thing that would not pass a pilot episode . The Sopranos have become a cultural phenomenon and universally recognized as one of the greatest TV shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano, the great crime leader of New Jersey, with an exceptional cast. Edie Falco is superb as a worried and loving mother of the upper middle class; Tony Sirico is great as a grizzled and superstitious consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> While the series has often been criticized for the negative stereotype of Italo-Americans as mafiosi, and to some extent, this is undeniable, I can see so many positives in the series. Representation of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; Could this be present in a rough television show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other hot topics are discussed, such as terrorism, social inequalities and injustices, homosexuality, drugs, etc. This is not a dull and boring show on the hardships and the violence. He has so much more. Most of the problems we see in the series are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing, which has been pretty good, has managed to integrate the current problems successfully and integrate them into the lives of the characters, which makes the whole thing more interesting. <br /> <br /> I have to go to David Chase, who created an excellent treasure for television, and James Gandolfini, for imagining the most complex and enigmatic character on television. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
