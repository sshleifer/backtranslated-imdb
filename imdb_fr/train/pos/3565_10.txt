Guys and Dolls is a unique character-based game. Sky Masterson <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-class player who bets on Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money to be able to <br /> <br /> perform his usual shit game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky could not take any girl to Havana, Cuba, and the "doll" he had chosen was Sarah <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons), who was in charge of a missionary. Sky finally buys <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. They end up falling in love with each other, but later she accuses him of something he did not participate in. Nathan did a bullshit at the missionary the night they left. Nathan's fianc√©e, 14-year-old Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), disapproves of Nathan's game and tries to stop him from doing so. However, when the film ends, everything ends well with a double marriage. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are just fantastic, no matter who sings it. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no singing voice at all and it's true they could have called him, but that did not matter. He did an excellent acting job (obviously since it's Brando) and interpreted his character very well. I saw some movies with Jean Simmons and I thought this movie was the weakest, she could not <br /> <br /> sing at all. However, Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye compose the song. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also part of Broadway's original <br /> <br /> production of Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like music, and even if you do not like it, I advise you to watch it.
