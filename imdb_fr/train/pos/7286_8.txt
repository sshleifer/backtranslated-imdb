I had a great time looking at this picture and was wonderfully surprised by its more erudite features. First of all, the film is undeniably made cheaply with its cardboard games, limited sets and creative scientific accessories. The actors range from very poor (the two strippers), barely professional (Herb Evers as leader), from Gothic overestimation (Leslie Daniels as assistant Kurt) to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the leading role as a headless victim living his will for the benefit of science and the lustful passions of his fiancee. The script is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk. Questions about the role of science and medicine in our lives and their limits must be many. This film is a reflection film in many ways. However, do not be fooled by his true intention. It's a shady story about a man obsessed with his medical science skills who wants to merge the head of his deceased girlfriend with the perfect body, creating the perfect woman for a man with the best body and soul. Another very brilliant aspect of the film is the saxophone music which resonates strongly each time the doctor travels the city in search of feminine beauties.
