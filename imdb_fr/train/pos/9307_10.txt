It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10. I'm a black comedy lover. With a cast including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London), the lines can not help but be dry. The distribution is almost dead. Counting minor flaws in the film: Ellen Barkin's makeup gave her face a washed-out look; Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor, two very nice cameos, are useless and the screening time of Michael J. Pollard is too short. Overall, the distribution was incredible without the egos ruining a good script. If you've seen Underworld (a crime black movie) by Larry Bishop (screenwriter, director), you'll appreciate this one. His next release (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
