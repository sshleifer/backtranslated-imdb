Yes, I loved this movie when I was a child. When I was young, I saw this film so many times that my father had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was worn out. <br /> <br /> My family received a VHS copy of this movie when we bought a new VHS system. At first, my mother was not sure if it was a suitable movie for a 10-year-old, but as we had just bought a new VHS system, she let me watch it. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie Does every little boy dream ?? The film contains a fantastic setting, big muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, big monsters and jokes you'll only meet when you get older. So, a few days ago, I inserted the video and watched the movie after a long time. At first, I was bored, then I started to think about how much I loved this movie as a kid and continued to watch. Yes, the experience was not as good as in my memories ?? The acting is pretty bad, the screenplay is pretty bad, the jokes were no longer funny, but the women were always pretty. Yes, I grew up. Even though the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it's worth 7 stars. For the good old days, you know?
