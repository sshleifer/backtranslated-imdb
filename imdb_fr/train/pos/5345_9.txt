Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I attended this moving history lesson. Spain enters again in the direction of the political confrontation. This is why this masterpiece should be presented in all Spanish high schools. This is a great lesson about the hidden crime of fascism. The American pilot involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses the democratically elected republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well highlighted in one of Uribe's most inventive scenes. The colors are beautiful. The cruelty of a war (could anyone tell me the difference between a war and a civil war?) Is used as a hope scenario when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. Cowards who begin to abuse their power even towards innocent children are active again. A film like 'El viaje de Carol' / 'Carol's Journey' tells one of the many sad stories of the twentieth century. It's a better history lesson that no book could contain. Another great job of the Iberian Peninsula!
