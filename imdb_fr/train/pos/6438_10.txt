"SÃ¥ som i me himmelen" ... as above so below ... this very special point where Divine and Human meet. I love that movie! A gem. YES thanks incredible! <br /> <br /> I was deeply moved by his HUMAN quality. I laughed and cried through a whole register, even several octaves of emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLANT like Daniel, a passionate performance of the highest order, powerful and charismatic. His inner light and exceptional talent are reflected in every scene, every interaction, every meeting. I was totally fascinated, delighted and caught up with history, which is our collective story, the story of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film also included many archetypes, messiah, wounded child, magical child, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, victim of violence, victim, bully, divine fool - ALL characters so real and so faithful to life - have awakened great affection and compassion. <br /> <br /> It's a real treat to watch a film that is as stimulating as it is entertaining and stimulating. Oh, let's not forget the celestial chorus of angels and its breathtaking sound. <br /> <br /> THANK YOU ALL - This Swedish movie will surely captivate people all over the world. BRILLIANT!
