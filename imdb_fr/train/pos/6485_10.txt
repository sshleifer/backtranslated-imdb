The World at War is one of the best documentaries on World War II. <br /> <br /> The 24 episodes deal with the war and the situation of the countries concerned. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how he was able to form one of the most powerful armies in the world. They were also interested in military actions during the war and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. You must all watch this. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
