Finally had to see this classic TV movie on an unofficial record recorded from an old VHS, it's a classic horror piece. It's a pity even more of this neglected horror corner in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the horror TV movie. Recommended for all fans of the TV movie of the 70s, a bit like a terrorist trilogy. Those interested should get the book on the subject of David Deal - Television Fright Movies of the 70's. Send me an email to have the chance to see it ..... it's fabulous to see him again. <br /> <br /> It has problems like a lot of TV movies they have to be quite inventive in the effects department and even at 70 minutes, it may seem like hanging out. We are all used to a more modern editing, but it is still a great thing and much better than many theatrical fears published today.
