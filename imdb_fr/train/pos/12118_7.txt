When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes, I thought we had problems. Condensing W. Somerset Maugham's gigantic novel into a film that lasts less than an hour and a half seemed like an imminent catastrophe. But you know, the movie is not half bad and it even manages to keep a good part of what makes the book resonates so much with its readers. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of moviegoers complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle of an actor, and it was, but I do not see anyone more apt to play the Philip Carey's role as a wet noodle, because that's certainly what Carey is. Howard plays it well, which means you want to shake him and slap him a few times, then take him out and buy him a thorn. <br /> <br /> Ah, and then there's Bette, like the girl with whom Carey obsesses and who brings his world to crumble around him. I did not know what Mildred's interest was in the book, and the film stays true to that detail. But as played by Davis, she becomes the most intriguing character in the story, and if she is nasty and improbable, she is at least the most dynamic person on the screen at any given time. Davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of action on the screen, as Brando would do nearly 20 years later, when he shouted "Stella !!" in this little known piece of Tennesee Williams, and it's not hard to understand why. Davis is intense enough to scare. She makes no effort to arouse public sympathy and she allows herself to appear ugly and less glamorous. Her appearance when Carey joins her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead from an unidentified illness (even if we do not take much care to hide the fact that it is an STD) is shocking. Of course, it is useful for this film to appear just before the coming into force of the Production Code. if it had been done a year later, you can be sure things would have been a little different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts, are left on the floor of the cutting room. and the story really becomes about Carey and Mildred and not much else. I thought it was the least interesting and the most tedious part of Maugham's novel, but it's the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the one that always attracts readers, so it's a wise decision for me. the part of the filmmakers they chose to adapt the novel as they did. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
