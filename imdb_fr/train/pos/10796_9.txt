If you are a fan of Chuck Norris & Judson Mills or both, then here is the movie to see.It contains a lot of adventure.This is an excellent follow up of Man's President.The chemistry that separates the top three stars (Chuck Norris, Jennifer Judson, Jennifer Tung) is amazing.My personal opinion.This film, as well as the original, proved so good that networks should consider turning it into a regular series.If you've seen President's Man, I recommend this film for you.If you've seen Man's President: A line in the sand but you have not seen Man's President, let me suggest you do it. You will not be disappointed with these results.
