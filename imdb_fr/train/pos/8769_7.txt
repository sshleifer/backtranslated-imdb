Gentleman Jim is another case where to print the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as an unbridled but charismatic social climber in a scathing entertainment that is barely lacking in breath. It is as pointless to look for historical precision here as in the Flynn Light Load Brigade - it's a real hokum with all the stops unveiled, filmed on a surprisingly sumptuous scale and animated by Raoul Walsh's vibrant direction. Flynn is still up to his strength (you would never guess he had a mild heart attack during production), with Alexis Smith, a gorgeous workout partner and one of our perpetual acolytes, Alan Hale , for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes on sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate galleon of Flynn's previous movies makes a cameo a bit out of place in a dockside fight! The 103 minutes pass right by.
