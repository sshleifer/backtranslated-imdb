It's a strange film, cerebral, surreal and esoteric. If the cinema of "intellectual horror" exists, it is this film. I started to be scared and I wish there was someone else watching it with me, and it barely has a plot! I will have to review this film several times before understanding it. If you're the kind of person who likes "My dinner with Andr√©" and Godard's movies, or if you take a lot of psychotropic drugs, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Sensational.
