This, and "the hidden fortress" are the Kurosawa that are dearest to me. I do not give candy to the 10, but it deserved it, if so. Although he is quite long (as are all Kurosawa), he has confirmed the problem that bothers me in most of his films; The scenario is often too vague and evolves slowly. It contains unnecessary scenes or simply too long, without any real use for the scenario or description of the character. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience as for example "The hidden fortress"; Despite its length, there was not a minute to cut. <br /> <br /> It's also a very unusual film about Kurosawa, he has no script, but a lot of small independent stories that are based more on the description of the character than the story, unlike anything another Kurosawa movie I've seen so far. He also relies heavily on dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between father and son planning their "new home"). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, what makes this a masterpiece is the way the subject, tragic as it is, manages to be described with such humanity and sympathy, without pointing fingers at anyone. From beginning to end, he offers the whole emotional range of laughter to tears in perfect balance.
