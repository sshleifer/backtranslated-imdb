It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG character and turns him into a secret service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! It's a solid political thriller that left me guessing. The detail work to show the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady was also intriguing. All tracks were good, but I could not accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. While Jodie Foster just made you pause your belief and really think she was the FBI Starling agent in "Silence of the Lambs", you do not feel the same way with Longoria. Nevertheless, it's a fun movie, an escape entertainment with the Beltway in the background.
