I have always loved this great baseball movie! He has a good cast including two great actors and two of my favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey are also in this movie! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has excellent special effects and plays all the actors of the film! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music of the composer Randy Edelman is very good and it goes very well to the film! Some of the actors who reminded me of the personalities of baseball. Ray Mitchell's character from Stoney Jackson reminded me of Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Sanders' commentator in My opinion was very much like Al Hrabosky's current appearance. This is a fantastic movie for non-amateurs and baseball fans and I highly recommend it!
