So neighbor was killing neighbor. It reminds me of Iraq. Looking at the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) Trailed behind the horse, I realized why burning this piece of red, white and blue does not upset me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Charter of Rights. I am a southern man and I must have some historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watch Tobey McGuire's character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave while observing the scalp of blacks and Germans (his ethnic background)) be bet to a game of poker ..... was interesting. Many twists in this movie. The wife, who is forced to marry, shows both desire and desire, characteristics that we are not used to seeing in "respectable beautiful South Victorian homes". <br /> <br /> The madman from the south who abandoned me is renegade deserved a glimpse of why my cousin, head of Gang Inc., a horse-robber company from Copeland, Mississippi, has Suspended at this time Bands of homeless men wandered in the countryside, armed. Remind you of Iraq? And how similar are we under the facade of religion and ethnicity? And why are Southerners ALWAYS fighting this civil war today? <br /> <br /> Too bad, we can not use the same knowledge to manage the country we have just invaded and occupied, causing a civil war everywhere. It is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, which has had the misfortune to sit on oil. The Missouri-eyed killers, attacking Lawrence, Kansas, might as well be the insurgents we fight without success. <br /> <br /> The father's homage to the Yankees who settle at Lawrence and stand there is another anomaly. a school "even before they erect a church, and for that reason they will win." Hey ????? I was taught history in Birmingham, Al, and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer ... that's why they won. Of course, they also literally had God at their side. As you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he is about to release his mother, sold as a slave in Texas. My God, what a horrible legacy slavery has left us. <br /> <br /> By doing pretty well, a lot of blood and self-control as the warriors happily get into the battle (but do not hear the screams of the rebels, remember Alabama soccer games ). You also understand how stupid the war was, as bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. They lost sight of why they are fighting, and so are we. An even more insane massacre. <br /> <br /> You are also made aware of the children without members coming back from Iraq, while the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) has an arm cut, to try to save him, then amputated him and then die. So much suffering for such a stupid cause. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to go back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this film was written by a Gore Vidal, because the spoken language is of a type that you would associate at that time, if you knew History. The dialogue is definitely stimulating. Not your ordinary cold-blooded war movie, by all means. You see the wounded soldiers but still on active service, still fighting because they have nothing else to do. You see the looters from the south, living off the land, flying without distinction. Yet at first you saw the battle stop so that women could be evacuated from danger. As I read the growing number of women and children dying in Iraq, I say, "Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?" I forgot why I was looking for this movie and I bought it after 20 years, but some books rented it somewhere. With reason. Tobey at his best, before Spideyman. Buy the DVD or rent it. And tell me why others praise that, not just the Liberals, it's me.
