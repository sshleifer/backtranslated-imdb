The most moving and revealing documentary ever created. I cried all the way from start to finish. As you watch the show, you are immediately captivated by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life that we take for granted. The first time I heard the title, I was almost scared to see the program. It was difficult for me to understand that I lived in agony every day of every year of my life. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny takes his coffin. Could you imagine doing that? Moreover, even though he was suffering from excruciating and unbearable pain, he still opened his own charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people to deserve respect and admiration, he's defining a role model, what a true and undeniable hero he was!
