"Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first film, was one of the most interesting and delicate ideas I've ever seen talking about movies. They only had a set, a group of actors and a plot. So what made it so special was all the effective direction, great dialogues and a weird condition that the characters had to treat like rats in a maze. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), was entirely devoted to his story, but "Cube" was not so good but here are the characters who are again tested as rats. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and makes Vincenzo return to his Cube era, locking up the characters again in a very different space without ever playing again with characters like playing with rats in an experiment room. But instead of a sci-fi thriller (even some promotional teasers and errant trailers seemed like that), "Nothing" is a light and light comedy that can certainly be described as a modern satire of our society and the world. intolerant people. we live. Once again, Vicenzo surprises us with a brilliant idea in a kind of thing so small. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario, that's all you have most of the time and you do not need more than that. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" is confusing, "Nothing" is the opposite but at the same time desperate. <br /> <br /> This film proves once again that an intelligent idea means more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the film sometimes fails, but its primary idea is very important and compensates for the flaws. There is nothing more to say about this film because everything is a brilliant surprise and an experience totally different from the one I've had in movies since "Cube".
