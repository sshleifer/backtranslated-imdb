If you want to watch a movie and you feel comfortable watching it, Tigerland is the movie for you. I like this film from top to bottom. The perfect scenes of this film look so real; it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama. Damn, I tell you ... The real dramas "they really fought" in one of the scenes (get the DVD listen to the comment, it's not obvious). I see this film as a group of desperate young men trying to escape an unhappy destiny. After watching Saving Private Ryan, I have an idea of ​​what an "unfortunate fate" is and I know exactly how the men in the movie feel. . I see this film as a cross between "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they find themselves in a "difficult" situation in real life? Some men go crazy, some men cry, some men wrists, others take drugs, some sleep randomly with prostitutes who try ruthlessly to eliminate the sense of love in their lives, some try to drink the pain, some jump buildings or bridges, others feel guilty and others feel so much pain that it makes them so sick that they collapse - physically. This film has all these desperate emotions in one bullet. But do not get me wrong, his film is not depressing, it's realistic, it's a very very humorous film, Bozz (Collin's character), insolent and funny, enlightens everything, and on top of that, he there are about 5 actresses in the film; I will let you discover what's inside! With the dialogue, the war / action sequences, describe perfect scenes with appropriate music; this film has everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not understand why Tigerland is heavily under-credited. The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover, it is written in big bold print: "The best movie of the year" and it does absolutely nothing less. Keep the rare jewels coming Hollywood, 10/10.
