If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or if you have any interest in seeing the true non-American side of caricature, then Riding Giants will touch deeper than anything you've seen before. <br /> <br /> This film is "unreal", an easy term if one existed, but quite appropriate if you can draw any literal meaning from it - it's a 100% factual documentary, but With all the drama of an opera, and the utterly apparent sense of love, expertise and knowledge instilled by the direction and narration of Stacy Peralta, this film expertly takes you from swell to big wave, while leaving you totally fascinated by everything that gives you the privilege to see. <br /> This film is a symphony, as well as Beethovens 9th, beginning magnificently by its prelude to Hawaii, drawing deep into human emotion in Santa Cruz and ending with a tumult, a triumph and a crescendo during the festivities of Laird Hamiltons, in Hawaii. br /> <br /> Like classical music; like Beethoven's 9th, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Believe me.
