Why can not this type of compact and entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century? This allows the viewer to think and guess the whole way. The cast is an excellent ensemble. William Powell has a real star quality. Who knows - maybe he was rehearsing for his future as Nick Charles. It is a joy to watch. We can also understand why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 films. He is an excellent character actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun to watch. Mary Astor works above average in a not very fleshy role. All other hands help make this a very pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtiz led the ball. Bravo!
