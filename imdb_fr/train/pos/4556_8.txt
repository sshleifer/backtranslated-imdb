I watched this film in a fierce joy. <br /> <br /> This is perhaps one of the best movies of all time. It has a timeless value, you can draw so much that it's amazing. Some parts are moving, fun and just great. <br /> <br /> All aspects are on site, the description of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% authentic, even small Irish subtleties have been covered. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high shots gives two superb views of Cristy (watch out for that). <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible. I have never seen an actor do that, ever. It's really unbelievable. <br /> <br /> And it's great to watch, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing you can get from real life. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you should see it. Do not doubt, there is something for everyone.
