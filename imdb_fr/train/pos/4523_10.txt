When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was slipping into this movie, my expectations of the entire movie were low. The only reasons I gave it a chance were the beautiful Julie Walters and a friend's recommendation. <br /> <br /> What I thought was a farce like "Mrs. Doubtfire" turned out to be a sweet joke and insightful comedy. Pasdar is quite credible and empathetic as an ambitious businessman who has to free the feminine part of his being by disguising himself on occasion. It conveys these needs to the public in a very credible way. Julie Walters is beautiful, is her habit, as the owner who teaches her unconditional love.
