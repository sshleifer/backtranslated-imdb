This film has it all: action, fighting, dancing, bull dance, music, pretty girls. This film is an authentic look at Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. A lot of money in oil, a lot of women and a lot of tonks. Too bad they're all gone now. The film is essentially that another boy meets a girl, a boy loses a girl, the boy gets a girl, but it is bought by actors and music. There is absolutely no movie with better music than this movie, including American Graffiti. It's a film that I watch over and over again and that I do not get tired of. Whenever I look at it, I'm still young and it's time to come out honky tonking. The only reason I only gave him a 9 is because you can not rate a movie from scratch, I do not think you should rate one.
