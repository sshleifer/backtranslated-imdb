"the day is over" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it's better than "close encounters of the third type". (I prefer independent cheese films to big-budget shows.) The special effects are cheese-based, but that's a big part of the fun. Jim Davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he's ever had in a feature film. the score is very good. history does not make sense. BUT THAT MAKES ONLY THE MOST INTRIGUANT. like many of the best works of art, "the day ends" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "The Finished Day" may be an independent, low-budget film, but it's no exaggeration to compare it to the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were independent small budget productions themselves.)
