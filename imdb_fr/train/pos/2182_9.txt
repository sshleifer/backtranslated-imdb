This awesome movie draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are perfectly at home in this story apparently provided by Billy Wilder. We would like to know more about all he has to do, because it is an exceptionally intelligent variant of the sterile master / servant fertile tale - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry, run by dry numskulls, but transformed into a world of living art and games played by an exploited subgroup of people and non-WASP. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and movies in the United States, it's hard not to see the underlying ideas of this film as prophetic.
