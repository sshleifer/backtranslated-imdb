You will notice by the stars that I gave to this BIG film that "... before seeing it for the first time" is implied. I had never heard of this movie and I had never seen it just because this week (and the last one) was a very slow rental experience (not really great to come). I do not know how this film went before me. I like Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is very good too. Yet this is the case. <br /> <br /> This film is a great example of what you can do if you do not have a big budget. There was just enough intrigue and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The film as a whole is you (the viewer) trying to understand the intrigues of many twists and turns. I would have given this movie 10/10, but some of the shots were pretty fake. I do not really approve of this film, but I do not think it deserves a perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she is quite underrated as a serious talent. Despite her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and does not trust her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotions. And it can seem cold and even lifeless if needed. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam does well in the beginning, at first, as a completely geeky corporate rat, ready to go through any labyrinth to prove himself. However, as it changes throughout the film, it feels like day and night. I know that some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law or other hopes of becoming the next James Bond will hate me for that, but Northam would / could / should meet that requirement. It is sweet and cultivated. He has an excellent posture and an excellent voice. I think he too can be cold if the situation requires it, and rather down-to-earth as well. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie and this movie enthusiast strongly recommend it to be seen at least once if you like corporate spy movies.
