I can understand why this film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Short Film because it was brilliantly built. Even if you do not particularly like blues (although it sounds much more like jazz), you can easily enjoy this movie. It's just very well done, but for my life, I do not see why the director Gjon Mili had to make only one film - this one. In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director has had no kind of dynamism in his career. Regarding black artists, I could understand that this does not lead to careers in their careers, because unfortunately most whites have an indifference (or worse) towards blacks or "that kind of music". <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you do not particularly like the previous part, go to about 5:50 - where it takes a lot longer. When the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise, the pace improved slightly.
