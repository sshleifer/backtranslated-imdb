I watched it a few years ago. I remembered it as a very mysterious situation and a mixture of melancholic things, such as Dorothy's destiny and Bogdanovich's personal future. <br /> <br /> I'm watching my VHS copy, then I'm looking at it more and more. Today, I'm waiting for the DVD version at any price, please! <br /> <br /> Country music and easy listening is very well chosen from the first second, a little bluish but also happy. <BR/> <br /> All the characters are great for me, with fun situations, fantastic acting and many dialogues that made this movie a cult movie for me and for many people that I I met on the internet or at movie clubs. It may not be fatal. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope for life! You must be happy and laugh as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I know that this may be a special comment for the film, but the fact is that I like it a lot, I think this film has marked me and I will never forget it.
