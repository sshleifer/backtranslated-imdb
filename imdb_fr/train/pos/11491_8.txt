The Unborn is a very, very different movie. James Karen and Brooke Adams are in the movie and they played very well. this film is built solidly and allows you to continue. Although I think you have to be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot. There is a brief nudity-free sex scene that could have been left out and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me in the movie and think that this kind of thing ruins a good movie, but that 'is all. There's a scene where Adams's character goes crazy and kills a cat, but you can say it's not real. The music is very different but very good. The Unborn in my opinion is a really scary movie, superbly unpredictable and quite strange! I recommend all horror fans to this movie!
