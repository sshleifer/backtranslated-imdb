I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are at the very end of the '80s and' 90s. I first watched Groove Tube in 2001, when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found it hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, for all who think that something "dated" can not be funny 30 years later ... think again! It's funny even if you do not know what the 70s looked like, and the thought of the bell pants makes you shudder. Who can argue with a Bozo the Clown guy who reads adult literature? There is something to laugh about. The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.
