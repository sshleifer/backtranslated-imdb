This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known group dEUS, will not be favored by everyone. For the simple reason that there is not a clear story or even a plot. This film shows only 24 hours in "a city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and really enjoy dialogues, staging, humor (Dario !, the Bruno osteopath! .. .) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) characters. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: the Windman on the beach, the dancing party at the end, the KISS fan, Windman visits the osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Clearly, some other viewers did not understand what is beautiful and interesting in this film. They complain that this film has no history, etc. But it's the atmosphere that prevents you from looking and that will take you inside. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched it yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary, as is Tom Barman and his group of US. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht hey." (do not tell anyone)
