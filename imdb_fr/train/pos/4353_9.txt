We had the chance to see this fantastic movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Upon entering the theater, we received a small opinion card that would be used for our personal film rating. Looking at the map, I turned to my wife and told her, "How many movies in your life do you think you can call great? Only about 5 for me." But then looking at the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while watching the spectacular scenery in the movie set in New York State, I slowly start raising the film in one category at a time. It was certainly good, but the totally natural repertoire of actors and the award-winning performance of a man who will unfortunately be remembered for his raincoat wearing the inspector rather than this film, the film has reached an excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there were only a few dry eyes in the house and my heart usually stoic and hard melted, like the Grinch, and I ended up give him a superb show. <br /> <br /> This image is a must for anyone with parents. No violence or nudity but strong language.
