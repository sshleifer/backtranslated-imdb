Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I read books all the time but if there is a movie with Will Smith, I'll watch it. He has the rare gift to train you in the film and to stick to it. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I watched it on Saturday and still can not get it out of my head. Incredible and sad at the same time. Thanks again, Will. You have to watch this movie from beginning to end to understand each part of the film. You can not miss anything. Make sure you have a lot of Kleenex and your man / woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle. WELL Worth the money you pay to watch it .. do not wait for it to come on TV.
