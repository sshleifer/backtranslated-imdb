... in our house. Like everyone who commented on this film, my brothers (10 and 4 at the time) and myself (10) watched this movie again and again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always go back because of great songs and adventure. We all loved the camel and sang loudly with him during his song. There are some slow moments (the time spent with King Koo-Koo in his yard) and we usually get bored after The Knight's song ("The reason I have {sound effect} is because I'm 'love too much'), but we loved the trip to save Babbette and the end and were all a bit panicked by the image of King Koo-Koo floating there towering over the horizon, manic laughing at the end. I still sing so far "Hooray for me!" Gay Paris Babbette! around my friends (I am now 33 years old) who look at me as if I had lost my head; However, when I sing, I'm 10 years old and I remember the wonderful year of Star Wars.
