As soon as I started to look at it, I realized that I was looking at quality production. So I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and produced by Sue Birtwhistle. They both brought us the excellent production of Pride and Prejudice from 1995! My only complaint is that Emma did not record 3 or 4 or even 6 episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was superb, I think the Prunella scales are excellent like Miss Bates, but I liked Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much. The language is a delight to listen to. Can you imagine having the right to attack someone without saying a word? Samantha Morton was excellent with Miss Smith, in fact, the casting was about the same as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! Thanks again to the BBC for another quality TV show. I saw the Paltrow version and everything is fine, but I think the BBC version is far superior. An excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD!
