And a movie made for TV too, this movie was good. the game in it and the plot was so great. It's one of the only movies I've seen that has upset my mind because after seeing it, I was afraid Reaper would come and kill me through the screen of my computer. There were some minor issues in this movie, but it was very easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr played an excellent role in this film with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. this movie has so much suspense and it made me want to have more because I never thought that a low budget TV movie could be so powerful. After watching this, I read the novel on which this movie was based (four times) and the kick was great. If you ever see this movie go on TV, I'll watch it. The effects in this movie were pretty well done, honestly, I really do not know what a human being would look like, but with the way the FX team made this movie, I was impressed and all this shows is that all these bad movies are made for TV out there with small budgets should not be afraid so badly. <br /> <br /> watch it. It's really good, not really, it is!
