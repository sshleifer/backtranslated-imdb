If you are under 13 or over 13 and you are intoxicated, you will enjoy D-war. If you're an avid fan of all kinds of brain-free action movies, you'll love D-war. Otherwise, do not bother! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and it made me feel good. Once the film was finished, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> The GC is good. Playing and directing are horrible. The scenario is extremely simple. But since half of the audience was children, they screamed, screamed, and applauded whenever the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the viewing experience much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to take your kids, but except for the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing. I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the children liked it so much.
