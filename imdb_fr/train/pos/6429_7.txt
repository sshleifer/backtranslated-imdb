If one believes the movies, the Chinese ghosts are much prettier and more mischievous than their Western counterparts. The scripts of the three films of "Chinese Ghost" are largely identical, but the orientation is excellent, the details and the colors are such that the problem does not arise enormously. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied of course many assaults. For those who have not yet encountered the trilogy "Chinese GhostStory", this film offers an interesting departure from the Western genre of horror / ghost; for those who have it, another fun adventure in the Chinese ghost world.
