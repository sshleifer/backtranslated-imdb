Okay, the first few seasons have taken a long time to go to special effects, but from the beginning, Hidden Frontier has always given good scenarios and good performances, and has always been ready to commit the mistakes they have made. They advise people to see the new episodes first, so they can see how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. The actors have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of guest actors who mark the show and who, with the fans, also testifies to the show, because the scenarios are reinforced. The series has pushed back the obstacles with its different stories - depression, addiction and homosexuality - and they may have rubbed a few people, but that's what Star Trek is and has always been. He describes these lines in an intelligent and emotional way, treating them subtly and gently. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some characters from Trek's story, but they did them justice - characters like Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, largely underused in the series, experienced a rebirth in the books of New Frontier, but they lost their breath after a while, when Peter David turned more to wild fantasy than in serious science fiction, and HF shows these characters in a completely different light , which serves them better. <br /> <br /> The site also allows fans to interact with forums and forums and get to know the people involved. They publish bloopers for each episode, so that fans can see what a laugh they have, because they are people who do it in their spare time, with a dedication that would thrill many professional actors in shock! <br /> <br /> What this series, which is now coming to an end after 7 years, accomplished with such limited resources is not surprising: bringing people together, inspiring others to even. HF will live long after its end, as long as people will always appreciate the reason it was created.
