From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless pickpocket (RICHARD WIDMARK) steals a woman's bag (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is ruthless to watch. This is partly because the acting is consistently strong throughout the cast, that the black and white photography is sharp and adds to the sharpness of the story and characters, and because the direction of Samuel Fuller puts him in the same category as the big ones like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as the movie Huston about a robbery that goes wrong - but the gain is not as strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is excellent as the girl with the hardness described by Widmark as being "reversed a lot". She gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role as a not-so-bright woman carrying a micro-film in her bag for her boyfriend (RICHARD KILEY), something the FBI already knows. They are on his trail when the flight occurs. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called "Moe" who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life. She is particularly touching in her last scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> It will hold your attention for an hour and twenty minutes. Good black Fox and remarkable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
