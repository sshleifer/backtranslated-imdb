Gandhi, the Great: <br /> <br /> Greatness in the world is associated with people like Alexanader the Great, Ashoka the Great for his greatness was glorified as greater than the human. Gandhi is called awesome not to be a Grand but to be more human, because I always believe that to bring out humanity in us is the greatest of human lies. Gandhi was a human with humanity and struggling for a humanity willing to sacrifice itself. in the battle for humanity but not his enemies. Now let's go to the film review. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi, my father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father is a film that does not talk about Gandhi, but about his son Harilal Gandhi.By telling the story The film manages to tell the story of a son of a deceitful father who led a nation to greatness. The film manages to tell the story. a criticism of Gandhi's failure as his son's father, I would rather say that this is a sacrifice that Gandhi had made as a father of a son to do justice as father of a nation. <br /> <br /> I wish the essence of this film prevails not only in India, in the Gandhian land, but in the hearts of all the inhabitants of this world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, the real human. Jaihind.
