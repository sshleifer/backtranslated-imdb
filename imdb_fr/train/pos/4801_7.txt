I watched this with my whole family at the age of 9 in 1964 on our black and white TV. I remember my father remarking that "that's how it could have been, Adam and Eve". I remember very well the scene where Adam found Eve, her eyes were blackened. I asked my father why his eyes were blackened and he said it because she was tired and hungry. Having not seen this episode for 45 years, I still remember it very well - TV shows come and go with the original planet, shelling scenes shaking the headquarters, the last scene of the two people s' away, Adam carrying his bag and Eve next. . It may not have been a theatrical work, but it certainly left an intense impression on me all those years.
