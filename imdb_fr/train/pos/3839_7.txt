Most people know that Paul Verhoeven is the director of many good (and bad) sci-fi movies in Hollywood. But long before that, he produced generic thrillers in his homeland. The story is a basic premise of femme fatale, nothing new or exciting. Verhoeven thinks he can improve things by adding a series of dream sequences that, instead of defining our main character and his situation, simply serve to advance the predictable plot. The scenario was solid, the dialogue helping to mitigate the effects of the bland story. What really made the movie less good is a fantastic action game. Jereone Krabbe was amazing as a "tortured artist" and the fans were also very good. In addition, Jan De Bont's cinematography adds at least a bit of life to the film, helping Verhoeven to appear at least as a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
