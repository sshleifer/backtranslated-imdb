Two sailors are on leave: the man with the women, Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and the shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and fall in love with her. There are more, but you have probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for a 1940s musical) is ridiculous and everything is so beautiful and so healthy - quickly annoying. Also this film is much too long. It's 140 minutes and it's way too much for such a stupid story. Jose Iturbi and his orchestra also published boring figures. It is still worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances or Sinatra or Grayson sing, it becomes magical. None of the songs are particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you would not mind. It was shot in rich Technicolor with all the brilliance that MGM had. The acting game is OK - Kelly is fine (although seeing him as a lady is pushing him) and Sinatra is just awesome (although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing him too!). Grayson has nothing to do, but she is incredibly beautiful to watch. Some shots of her literally took my breath away! There are many strong points here: the great dance and song number of Sinatra and Kelly; Sinatra singing anything; Grayson's two songs and the well-known animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom is also doing a funny cameo. There is also little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene in which he is. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot just does not fit, but it's still worth catching. It was a huge success in his day.
