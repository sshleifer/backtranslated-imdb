Fascinating film, based on a true story, about an Australian, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), accused of killing her little girl. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus around the case, how the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynchic pop mentality that eventually led to the conviction. of the woman, based on hardly tangible evidence. I love movies that question the media, as well as those who take a critical look at how people are driven by the justice system. I always thought that we had to show the jurors 12 angry men before they did their jobs. It is not, as has often been said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we interpret, as human beings, events based on our prejudices and our desire for vengeance. A cry in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi takes care not to make a film at all melodramatic. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I have found it attractive.
