Halloween is the story of a boy misunderstood child. He discusses his problems with his older sister, whom he murdered at the beginning of the film. This is just the beginning of Michael Myers things to come. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays the role of the doctor who has been studying Myers for years. He knows something different in him, mysteriously bad. This evil will not be controlled and it can not be stopped. <br /> <br /> After escaping from an institution, Myers finds his younger sister. If he kills her, the troubles of this misunderstood boy may well stop. But he seems to have a hard time finishing his sister while other people get in his way. He manages to get them out while looking for the girl he needs. <br /> <br /> There have been many of these horror movies featuring teenagers being destroyed in pieces by a masked or macabre murderer. But this one started all, sort of. If you think about it, most of these horror movies we all remember are those in which Freddy Kruger or Jason run after a half-naked girl. Well, without Halloween, these characters would not have haunted our dreams when we were kids. <br /> <br /> Halloween director John Carpenter has taken full advantage of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew in a film that scared a lot of people in the end This film solidifies him as a director to watch and also begins the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl hunted by the masked killer. <br /> <br /> This film may seem clich√© today, but at that time it was not much like that. It has been copied and ripped off, but Halloween will always be the ultimate horror movie for teenagers. It always gives you chills as you listen to the thrilling music of Carpenter while we see another victim being chased by this shadowy Michael Myers.
