EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A very bad actor doing very well. Richard Gere has always held a rather odd position on the American stage in Hollywood, without any dramatic talent, and has always bet on leading roles that retain a notable presence today. But nowadays, he seems to have turned more towards these kind of roles directly on DVD / limited versions and so seems perhaps more determined in his strong now. <br /> <br /> He has to rely on a serious question here. Earl Babbage, a cynical and hardened social worker, has been assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of ​​the United States and, with his new protégé, Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes), must seize his latest case, diving into the abduction of a young woman who was trying to forgive herself for an affair he had failed long ago. <br /> <br /> It's a dive into the darkest side of humanity, walking on material that is definitely not for the freaked or for those looking for visualization light. And as such, it's a pretty strong, convincing, no-frills film that is not constrained by its direct budget for DVDs. The only thing that really holds him back is the hectic, fast-paced camera sequences used in the most dramatic moments that look a little tacky after a while. But it's still the strongest material in which I've seen Gere, getting darker and more and more uncertain. ***
