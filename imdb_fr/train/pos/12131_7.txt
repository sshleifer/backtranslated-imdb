The film is about Philip (Leslie Howard). He is a serious but handicapped medical student. He falls in love with a heartless and predatory waitress called Mildred (Bette Davis). Meanwhile, he has a romance with another suitor (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee) but she returns to a mutually destructive affair. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and the first of many film versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis as a cruel cockney waitress winning another magnificent rendition with a seductive and thirsty performance, absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the final. Davis rose to fame with his performance. The domineering woman will be repeated several times in the posterior ones. Leslie Howard as a fundamentally good and honest student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholy performance. He was a brilliant actor (Gone with the wind) alongside the producer and writer and died in a plane crash during the Second World War. Both will play again in "Petrified Forest" (1936). The mood film is painstakingly reconstructed in the studio RKO (Radio Picture Inc) and is quite convincing. Revised in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The film will appeal to classic moviegoers. Note: Very good but a little dated.
