To get in touch with the beauty of this film, be very careful about the soundtrack, not just about the music, but how all the sounds help to weave the images. How beautiful the opening scene that led to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity! Note the way the music introduces the characters as we are led into Giovanna's wedding. Do not expect to find much here about the political life of Italy in 1943. This is not what it is. On the other hand, if you are sensitive to the music of images and sounds, you will be drawn into a word that goes beyond neo-realism. At the end of the film, there are moments that resemble an Antonioni landscape that have more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
