I only saw it once. It happened in 1952, I was seven, the movie 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I kept in mind, forever, the highlights of the sacrifice of Gunga. <br /> <br /> I realized how hard it was for a people to be subjected to and used by a foreign country. In these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a sort of unfamiliar friendship, one that is formed between people who share daily life, who see each other, who know each other, are called but belong to different worlds, can only bring out. Then, in the most critical moments, a troubling question arises: "Who are we, in the first place, supposed to be loyal?", What people, family, fatherland, the person you know close to you? You do not have time to give a perfect answer, the urgency is there and it's for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer by sacrificing himself. Somehow, in a confused way, a problem remains unresolved, emotion grows with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities that we can see today, because this death, this unique disappearance the life I lived it, I shared with my child the unconditional friendship. It was lived by the viewer that I was. That day, I lose Gunga-Din forever. Leaving behind me, later, my childhood, many worlds in which I lived. I left all this for good and these lines are today a short visit that I did not expect to do this morning when I get up.
