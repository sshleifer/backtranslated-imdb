I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it's so difficult to present the entire book as it should, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they did a very good performance with Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I could see Lady Dedlock's pain, even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Dedlock ... I do not know who could have created a better Jarndyce, but I agree with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long books of Dickens - Oliver Twist would be easier - it's long, and if you do not care about all the legal situations, you might get bored or bored. I think this presentation is fun enough to not be boring. I just liked Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There's always a child - Jo's going to break your heart here ... I think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that I I loved the show. Maybe if I re-read the book, as I usually do, after seeing the movie, maybe I could be more critical. In the meantime, I think the presentation is good.
