* I mark where there are spoilers! General Comments: If you can take a serious movie, go see that. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater because you are confused as to what is going on! The film fits well in the second half. I will take my mother to see him again when the film officially opens. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see this during a screening a few weeks ago, when Will was promoting the film. He was great - spent a lot of time with the fans. Thanks for the photo Will! About Will's performance: Often, when you see a movie with a truly famous actor for another movie / show, you always think about them in their current performance, just as you think about their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this film. I had not imagined the Fresh Prince (lol) when I watched this movie. He was completely convincing in this very serious role. He has grown enormously as an actor. I think he will have at least one sign of oscar for this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very confrontational and tormented. He's sad ... guilty ... very determined, but very scared. Very faithful to himself. His character has a lot of depth ... and one way or another, Will has managed to bring that to life. <br /> <br /> About Emily (Rosario): Rosario did a great job representing Emily, a woman very late on her. the taxes. Will may not be the shining star, Will is in this film, but she was very convincing. I think his character just does not have as much work with Will's. <br /> <br /> About the plot (no telling): I admit that I did not like the movie before the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the movie, and nothing made sense until the second part or so. But when things end up going together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's an extremely intense film that is really important to you. <br /> <br /> You need a lot of time to watch it. In the theater where I was, most people were crying, even adult men. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment ... <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS Minors ***** That's why he's very difficult to talk about the plot without giving big things. I feel too much to know about this movie really ruins it. There was however a lot of symbolism in the film that I enjoyed. I will mention a few here (without trying to reveal a lot). <br /> <br /> - The fish Ben kept in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense. There was a lot of chatter in the movie theater when people understood the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> -I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. In the end, I loved and hated him. That's how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was a fool for Ezra, a blind man who was just trying to make his way around the world. The reason he treated Ezra that way became very clear later in the film. Wait anyway. Everything in this movie: wait. <br /> <br /> -Ben is a fundamentally good person who has made a big mistake for which he will not forgive himself. I still do not know if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to get rid of his own guilt or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a bit of both ... I think he wanted to help people but also get rid of his past. I love his character You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is not surprising. You hate him because of what he does (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Good job Will.
