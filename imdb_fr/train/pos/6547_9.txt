I took my 10 year old daughter to see Nancy Drew at the weekend and had a great time. First of all, it was clean, and I mean by my standards. Today, the majority of children's films are filled with raw humor and crude jokes to elicit cheap laughter among pre-teens. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, though, and the humor is subtle and clever. <br /> <br /> The title role is played with refreshing vivacity by Emma Roberts, who is playful and polite without ever becoming boring. Unlike Brady Bunch, where anachronistic characters are ridiculed and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great moment when the shop owner fires the Los Angeles "style-conscious" girls with their Paris Hilton street outfit, while Nancy, in her loafers and her homemade Butterick patterned dress, is kissed. This film avoids the temptation we need to enlighten this healthy girl that so many Hollywood movies take. Nancy remains true to herself and her values ​​throughout her life. <br /> <br /> The mystery is just tense enough at times to spark commitment. There were several suspenseful moments when my daughter nervously took my arm, but there were no free shock scenes. Everything is based on tension and mood and is very fun. The cast is good, especially Marshall Bell as a scary guardian. Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis are excellent cameos and many moments will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This film deserves better reviews than those that some have given it. Not only am I happy not to be dragged into another computer animation movie where talking animals drool and go gas everywhere, but I was also very entertained. If I had been there without children, I would have enjoyed the movie. This is a DVD that will be named after my daughter under the Christmas tree.
