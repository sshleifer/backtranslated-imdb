This show was fabulous. It was complex and well written and all the characters were friendly without being horribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake the boyfriend Philandering was friendly. As our waves are filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not too much of a soap opera. It was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance. It's really annoying that we finally have a series that makes you think a little and is projected because of a mysterious number that most of us do not even pay attention. Some of us are not sheep. This show may not be missed by many people but rather loyal fans.
