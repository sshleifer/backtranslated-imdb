Seeing this movie, I was a bit skeptical, because fantastic movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I did not know that I would do a trick through cinematic magic. Everything in the film, from intrigue to dialogues to effects, was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like the star of the movie. From beginning to end, you fall more and more in love with this character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening as a perverse witch wanting to capture the star for her eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is an adorable character who brings to the public the greatest comic relief as the film gains ground towards the climax. <br /> <br /> It's a film that, on the whole, surprised me and delighted me as a film buff. Stardust is the way to go if you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie that will appeal to both children and adults.
