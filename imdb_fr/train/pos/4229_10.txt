Do not waste time reading my opinion. Check out this amazingly good episode, which could be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly chosen as the mysterious and mysterious mysterious writer who assassinates her son-in-law to avenge the murder of her daughter. Columbo is his usual crumpled character, troubled and much smarter than he seems to be, and this episode in particular presents a fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, it was not written by the creators Levinson or Link, but it is perhaps Columbo's most dense, original and loaded scenario ever. Completely satisfying in almost every department and bursting with fun and spiritual dialogue and reflection. The truly unexpected and inventive climax dominates all. 10/10 ... look for this one on Netflix!
