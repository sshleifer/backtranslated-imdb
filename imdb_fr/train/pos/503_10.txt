After 7 years of watching this appalling absurdity called Star Trek Voyager, I felt rather numb. Next Gen and DS9 were good things and Voyager ruined TV Trek. This opened with probably the best driver at a Trek show. The crew was really good, as was the choice of actors for the roles. Scott Bakula played a typical captain for the first time in deep spaces and his unapologetic way of doing things was a refreshing change from the captains who already knew everything. The rest of the team was very friendly in their roles and I think he had a good first season. When the show was canceled prematurely, I was really disappointed. In A Darkly Mirror showed us what casting was capable of. Too bad a movie or TV movie was never considered. So much about the history and foundation of the federation remains to be told, including the beginning of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
