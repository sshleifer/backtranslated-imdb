I watched this French horror movie last night and I liked it. The entire film takes place in a prison cell with three prisoners who find a newspaper handwritten on a wall of a serial killer who escaped from prison 20 years earlier, without leaving his cell . While browsing through the newspaper, they discover that he immerses himself in black art and commands that could allow them to leave the cell and go to freedom. What they discover is something completely different and horrible to say the least. I like low-budget horror movies, which deliver the products in a fairly qualitative way and tell a good story. That's what this movie does, although it took a while to get going. The result and the horror they trigger interest me a lot, and I enjoyed the ride. Not a lot of gore, but it would not be appropriate, even if the gore is pretty good.
