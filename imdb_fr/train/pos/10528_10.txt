I was so impressed by the cinematic version of Jane Austen's novel, "Emma" by Doug McGrath, and I liked Rachel Portman's score so much that when I went to the video store one day, I discovered that the two had gathered for "Nicholas Nickleby" I immediately rented it without further consideration. <br /> <br /> I read the book, and for the fans who are too critical of Jane Austen's adaptation, I do not know what McGrath could have done to capture the spirit and Major elements of the plot of Miss Austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two-hour film (some of which complained of being too long!). And as for Gwen Paltrow's accent, I must confess that I did not know her too well when I saw her at the theater, and that I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress! <br /> <I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush landscapes. This is one of the things I love and I hope to see in period pieces set in the English countryside. The beautiful backgrounds of the film make a decisive contribution to its attractiveness and success. If your idea of ​​the Escape Tariff is something darker, then you should perhaps praise something like "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> The English country sets are as appealing and charming as the cast, and combine with the story and soundtrack for the entertainment that does not tire you of repeated viewing. McGrath is a marvel in the choreography of the combination of subtle expressions that are so essential to convey the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie could also be an example of the enjoyable quality of a movie. less sex, violence or even a naughty antagonist. The story is often fun, endearing and sometimes very touching. <br /> <br /> I've seen many adaptations of Jane Austen's competent books, but that's definitely my favorite.
