When I heard that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch. It took me weeks to understand that I had seen the original and loved it. So I have more reasons to watch. Well, I looked. It was actually better than most TV movie suites. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and I did not like most of the characters, including Brian's. But the film needed nerdy, annoying and imitative characters to shine Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) once more. In the end, I encouraged Stanley and his own happy ending. If you like the original version of Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror movies without the blood, I suggest you look at this.
