May 2004, Wonderland is relatively new to the UK. Shiny movie of a brutal real story. If you know LA since the early 80s, you will understand how captured she is. The use of the elements that make up his cinematographic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the spectator closer to his presence. The use of a disjointed Pulp Fiction timeline makes it possible to explore the uncertainty about what really happened, while the direction and performance of the distribution is attracting attention, particularly Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I distributed them.
