I remember seeing this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I would love to see him again - does anyone know how to get a copy? If I remember correctly, it was a particularly powerful film. In particular, we see horses wearing gas masks. Apart from that, I really do not remember the story - that's why I want to see it again! I've been on the web, but I can not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - maybe there's no DVD or VHS on the market. I would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this subject. Thank you very much in advance for your help. Sincerely, Albany234@googlemail.com
