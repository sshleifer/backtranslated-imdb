Ever wanted to know how Hollywood could get by before the Hayes Code is officially put into effect? Well, unfortunately, "Convention City" is lost, so just look at "Tarzan and his mate" to find out. For 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual insinuations and even exposed flesh. Just watch Jane's nude swim. Although Tarzan is often considered a b-adventure movie made for young boys and for no one else, this photo proves that the series was originally very adult. More than seventy years later, he is still as sexy as when he was released. <br /> <br /> In addition to the taboo nature that grows, it's a superb and exciting adventure story. I've always loved the jungle movies produced by Hollywood in the '30s and' 40s, but few of those I would call big movies. "Tarzan and his companion" is by far the best film of this long gone subgenus. The sequences of attacks on safari by monkeys or natives still manage to create tensions today. In addition, the animals are too cool (especially the monkeys who throw rocks). The acting game will not win a major award shortly, but is certainly more than enough for this type of film. The film is once again stolen by Cheetah, the most intelligent monkey in the jungle. One of the most fun examples of Hollywood pre-code on the market.
