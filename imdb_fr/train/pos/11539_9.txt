THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous piece about a television journalist, Felix Unger, a thirst-crazed maniac, who settles with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, sports and slob journalist , following his wife. Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets him from the moment he does it. Neil Simon's classic comedy arrived for the first time on Broadway with Art Carney with Felix and Walter Matthau with Oscar. Jack Lemmon succeeds Carney in the film version with a memorable performance performed by Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but also so real that it brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure Felix Unger. Fortunately, Matthau was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar, a unique comic performance gem that provides constant laughter. This team of Lemmon and Matthau proved to be a gold comic that has been revisited in nine other films. With these two actors who are no longer among us, the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious. Simon's play was enlarged for the screen with a silent prologue recounting FÃ©lix's depressed suicide attempt. Secondary actors include Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as poker buddies for Oscar, and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Piedgon sisters, the blind dates of Oscar and Felix. Of course, he later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but nothing looks like the original. A joy from the beginning to the end.
