Shakespeare said we are actors in a big stage. But when this stage is Israel, the work that we interpret is multiplied by ten and all our actions are marked by harshness. Dan Katzir manages to paint a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but Katzir also manages to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people, and these people, far from being mere personalities, speak to us with their hearts. . Katzir's film allows Israel to escape the dark source of information in which they live, and this marvelous land appears in the light like a beautiful bird born from its ashes. This is very good for me because the reality of the State of Israel, which Europeans only know about news papers or newspapers, appears as an intimate and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people seeking its place, exploring the entire state, all culture for the sole purpose of feeling that it is part of it. Katzir builds an absolutely wonderful documentary and he shows that when a man films with passion, the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank you Dan for opening your eyes and offering us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most beautiful countries in the world.
