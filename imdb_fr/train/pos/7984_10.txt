Man on Fire is certainly one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. Despite slow beginnings, the story is so complex and sensitive that it unites rather well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, in which he plays a bodyguard, called Creasy, tormented by his past and alcoholic but who never abandons his duty to save his last protégé, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very intelligent and enthusiastic girl who loves so much and acts very convincingly. She has a great future ahead of her. As I said, the story is a bit complicated. To understand it perfectly, you have to look at it several times. <br /> <br /> This film is composed of two parts, there is the first hour, where everyone is happy. , nothing is wrong, everyone lives his life happy until the kidnapping of Pita and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there is the second part, the rest of the film, where everything becomes suddenly complicated and somewhat macabre and disturbing, when Creasy recovers from his serious injury and starts to pursue and kill the many criminals and "La Hermamdad" who were responsible for the planning and execution of the Pita kidnapping. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his latest acting skills alongside many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It's a shame that this film was not quite recognized, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, just like Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects that were of very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like thrillers excellent, slightly disturbed, suspenseful, this is the one to see. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this movie are based on a real story and real characters! 10/10
