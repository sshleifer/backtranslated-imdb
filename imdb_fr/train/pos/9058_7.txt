I read the book in grade 5 and a few years later I saw the movie. There are some differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days and not 10 in a day at 7 pm. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is supposed to get $ 30 after eating all the worms. In the movie after Billy has eaten all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is supposed to simulate some of the verses but in the movie he does not do it at all. <br /> <br /> Even if there are changes, this movie will always be appreciated by children.
