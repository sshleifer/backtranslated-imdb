This documentary (now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary citizens to overcome injustice. Everyone must see it. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected by an overwhelming vote in 1998. His program was to divert the fantastic oil wealth of the 20% of the middle class to 80% of the poor. It has banned foreign driftnet fishing in Venezuelan waters. He has sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the shantytowns to treat the sick free of charge. It eliminated illiteracy and created new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it's his 30% tax on profits of oil companies that has put him in trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, as Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain interviewed Chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs, a CIA-backed coup was launched. As the cameras turned, Chavez was captured and taken out of the country. It was announced on national television that he had "resigned". <br /> <br /> But the poor of Venezuela did not believe the media. They went to the palace by the millions and demanded that Chavez be fired. Faced with so many, the army turned against the coup leaders and the conspirators fled to the United States. Chavez was saved by a military helicopter and regained his joie de vivre.
