Barbarians may not be the best movie any of us have seen, but really ???? ... It's so funny ...... I can not say how much I laughed. When I saw it for the first time, the director really wanted to make a serious adventure movie, but it's as bad as that ... so bad that it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen I've never seen ..... So my advice is that you should see it ..... and if you've already done it, review it !!!!!!!
