by saying that, I mean it's not a well done film, but it's a very good version of the real event and the best representation to date. And if you're a fan of WW2, then it's a treat for you, because there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie. It's at best a theater, but it's always like before a semi-documentary. <br /> <br /> Personally, I am an unconditional fan of our almost superhuman heroes of the Second World War, and there should be hundreds of them. If these children do not read books, they watch movies. <br /> <br /> So, if you want an extravagant adventure, rent Private Ryan is the truth about persistent pain, outrageous stamina and the will to fight when everything seems lost.
