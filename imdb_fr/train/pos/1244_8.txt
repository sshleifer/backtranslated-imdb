I saw this film for the first time on television a few years ago and, frankly, I liked it. Charles Dance is one of the most terrifying villains we can imagine. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast with the cruelly good hero. I have never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, but I find his irritating portrait here a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley through the mirror". Charlotte Lewis is, to use a worn but only applicable phrase, wonderfully bright. Some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation. Through all this, Murphy is the modern man suddenly fallen into an oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his whimsical oriental fantasy. Like this film, we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, as short as they are, even enhance the quality of Derek. Since 1955, Hong has defined the supporting actor, the "class group" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is silly; it's not perfect; but it has so many editorial features that it is a fun and fun fantasy that deserves to be watched. After four years, I saw "The Golden Child"; I enjoyed it even more! It's really very funny.
