Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay from the 1940s and previous years. And I mean that positively, since I'm definitely not a hater. His films are simply high quality entertainment, just like Raoul Walsh's films in his day. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is a quality entertainment. In addition to a first-class director, the film also features a first-class cast, starring Errol Flynn, lead actor of Raoul Walsh, in the lead role. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was the quality of boxing matches. They used a very dynamic camera work, which also made the boxing matches edifying and exciting to watch, with the final fight against John L. Sullivan in the final title. <br /> <br /> The biographies of the 1940s and earlier were obviously still very different from today's biographies. Modern biographies often glorify the main subject and show his life, from birth to death, through all aspects, mainly emotional. "Old" biographies were just like movies that were not based on real characters, which also means that filmmakers would often use a lot of creative freedom with the character's personality and events in his film. /his life. This film is not only a biography of a boxing legend, it is also a faithful portrait of the period during which illegal naked fights have entered the modern era of boxing. Errol Flynn does a great job representing the real life famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Jim Gentleman. Not many people knew it, but Flynn did very good jobs in the 1940s, including this movie. Fysicaly, he also looks in great shape. He also looks quite different besides, without his characteristic little mustache in this movie. The film also features very good actors and a good acting game. <br /> <br /> A great and entertaining film that still resists today. <br /> 8/10
