The visual art of Tsui Hark is at its peak in this film. Unfortunately, the terrible acting of Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the need to strangle her by looking at her, it's so bad :), it was difficult to watch from time to time . <br /> <br /> This film is a real breakthrough. in the visual department. When I saw this for the first time, my jaw dropped several times and I thought I had never seen anything like it, but that's how it should be done to fully justice to the mythical world of historical novels of kung fu in China. ! This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful historical epics of Chinese kung fu ever made. <br /> <br /> But alas, Tsui Hark has not improved much at the editorial level, and the story and dialogue are rather juvenile (his apparent obsession with the stupid and long description of the wicked n did not help either). To make matters worse, this movie is very badly shot. They decided to use the "popular" idols of Hong Kong as main characters, but unfortunately, Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung are totally unsuited to the historical dramas of kung fu because they lack the nobility and the mystique that such characters are supposed to embody. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better. <br /> <br /> I wish that one day, Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark could join forces and produce a film presenting the artistic talent of Tsui but with the maturity and the narrative poetry of Zhang ...
