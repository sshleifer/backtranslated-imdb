Private Lessons II is without a doubt the biggest movie I have ever seen. A Japanese import (poorly) translated into English is a joy to watch. It does not make much sense, but it does not matter. It's the biggest comedy in the world without ever being intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> The film is rare and not available on video, but I caught it a bit later, late on a pay-TV. My recorded copy has been viewed dozens and dozens of times as I slowly introduce, person by person, this gem of the film to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays Ken's guardian / lover, our hero. (Apparently, she was just working for her check.) Ken is portrayed by Goro Inagaki, from the Japanese group SMAP, who gives the best of himself and has great hair during the film. Stacy Edwards, from "In the Company of Men", also appears in the film and is probably happy that she has found other film works afterwards. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three views to determine what is intriguing. By repeating the viewing, you can enjoy such items as the unusual amount of vases that Ken has at home (at least 50) or that Ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered corn husks in the film's finale. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable, but highly quotable. My friends and I are reconstructing whole scenes. Yes, it looks like we are lame losers and we are ... but we are lame losers who have seen "Private Lessons II". Be one of only ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You'll thank me for that.
