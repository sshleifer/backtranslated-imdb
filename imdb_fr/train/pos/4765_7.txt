A priest who has abandoned his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained. <br /> <br /> This film deals with the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post-war France, there is also talk of the mortal aspect of faith itself. <br /> <br /> It may not be the film of a lifetime, but it is a sin to let it fall into oblivion. Besides, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
