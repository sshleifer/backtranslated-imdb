I really like watching this movie because of all the scary scenes on raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are those where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the movie of Friday the 13th with the girl who eats the banana. <br /> <br /> I really like to watch a lot of this film because the computer graphics seem a bit wrong, but it's okay because once in the film, we barely notice what's going on and I think that it ends well even if I did not really understand what was happening in my film. The first two views, I have understood over time and this is the important part. The other important element is the fear of dinosaurs if you look at it for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST FILM.
