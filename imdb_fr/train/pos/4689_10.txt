I totally agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most extraordinary and informative I have ever seen. As stated before, I remember that I started looking, thinking it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the history of the colony incredible, but I remember that music was an integral part of its appeal. If I remember correctly, they were Native American pipes (which resembled the music of the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I too was looking for a copy. This should be necessary to monitor anyone, but especially schools. It should be reissued.
