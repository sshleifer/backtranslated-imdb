I've had tears in my eyes a few times when I watch a movie. And there was only one time I really cried and that's when I saw this movie. This film has some kliches but I do not care. I'm crying as I write this and it's been a long time since I've seen it. It is perfectly fine and all the production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know it in our hearts, but it's not always easy to remember that the only thing that really counts in life is LOVE in all its forms. It's only when we love that we are really alive. I know how sentimental I look and I promise you I'm not that way. I am pretty cynical. This film has given me more feelings of grief and happiness than any other film and it will probably always be the first film I recommend to others to see.
