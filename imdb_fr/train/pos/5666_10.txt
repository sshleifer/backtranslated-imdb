I loved this show when it was broadcast on TV and I was upset when I discovered that someone somewhere had decided that it did not deserve to be pursued! For years, I hooked to my copies of this show, those that I had recorded or that someone had recorded me. It's up to now. The powers in place have finally decided to publish this wonderful series on DVD and I finally could put my small enthusiastic hands on the complete set. Which brings me to this part; The part about this show is all about it. <br /> <br /> American Gothic is about good towards evil, essentially a fight between Lucas Buck (who is Buck, with a B). He is a malignant sheriff from a small town in South Carolina who manages things as he sees fit and will stop at nothing to get his way. I thought the series was wonderfully written and staged. there is still a lot of life to live. I really hated it when it was canceled, but that's how it feels for me when I finally find something interesting to watch on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole did a great job as sheriff Lucas Buck, he just has what it takes to be successful. The other actors have also done a great job, so I guess you could say, even the cast was a hit with me.
