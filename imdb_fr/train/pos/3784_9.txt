One of the most underrated movies I've seen in a long time, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is Bill S. Preston Esq's hilarious second adventure. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch this movie: First, you see a stupid dialogue, a wacky intrigue, a youthful idea. OR .. You see stupidly understated idiots who find themselves again in a situation too big for their brains. Throw a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar in this plot and it becomes a big hit movie. Bill and Ted go down in history with the same level of sincerity, with the exception of Bill and Ted. It's a delicate barrier to balance, but when you watch the movie, it's not a ball comedy, but an adventure involving two guys who have nothing to do with the adventure, it becomes so much more.
