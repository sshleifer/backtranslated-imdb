I loved the movie. I loved the two families crossing each other in history. The only question that arises is whether Sam is killed, how is his family's lineage continuing? He is the son of Mrs. Zeroni and Zero is supposed to be related but no mention of other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Have you never mentioned any other child or wife before he talks to the teacher and falls in love? Maybe she had a child before becoming the Kate Bandit kiss? Even with the errors in the film. Just loved. The game was great. I do not know where Mr. Sir's story was, Marion is a woman at the end, but makes her character even more funny. The other "counselor" seemed worried about the kids, but maybe not so much. The poor guardian had to have a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up.
