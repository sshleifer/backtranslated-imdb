Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. It's not only a fun and completely entertaining comedy, but it's also a cinematic look back at a bygone era, with attitudes and scenarios sadly more than a memory of British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway interprets Arthur Pemberton, a resident of Pimlico who, after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb, discovers a wealth of medieval treasures belonging to the 14th century Duke of Burgundy, buried under the small suburban street in the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> Treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which has never been officially canceled) and declaring that this London street had been declared Burgundy Land, which means that in the eyes of international law, Pemberton and the other local residents are no longer British subjects, but inhabitants of Burgundy and their little street, a country in its own right and a law in its own right. <br /> <br /> This sets the tone for peace and poverty. They feel well placed because they believe they are outside the law and the English jurisdiction. So, in a drunken act of defiance, they burn their ration books, destroy and ignore their clothing coupons, flagrantly flout the British licensing laws, say Britain. <br /> <br /> However, what happens then is always a bargain, the black market and the dishonest scammer follow suit and cross the "border" in Burgundy as a refuge against the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dubious goods and half of London consumers follow them to dodge the ration, creating their peaceful and quiet haven, den of thieves and a rather crowded place. <br /> <br /> Call for help from Whitehall, they are Due to the evolution of the situation, it is "now a foreign policy issue, to which His Majesty's Government is not inclined to get involved ", which leaves the inhabitants doing nothing. They say, however, that the area is a legal border and, as such, set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road, mainly to control contraband only to guarantee the safety of the inhabitants of Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The border is completely closed, resulting in a major siege, with people in Bugundian slowly lacking water and food, but still fighting in the purest British style. As a resident of Bugundian says, "We are English and we have always been English, because we are English that we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians". <br /> <br /> A feeling that quickly echoed through when the rest of London learns that the poor Bugundians are in a difficult situation, they all feel obliged to help and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockade. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, who fought so that the invaders through the centuries are finally put on their knees by this new group of foreigners, especially since they are English !!! ! <br /> <br /> Great tale, and very entertaining all along. Do not miss.
