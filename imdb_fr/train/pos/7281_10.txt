I saw this film for the first time on a local channel during the horror show on Sunday afternoon, around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was just a little kid at the time, but I loved it and I was not really scared of it. I thought his screenplay was so original and original. Looking back, I am always surprised that it was broadcast during the day on uncut T.V. those years. I've been looking for this movie since, I live it again and again and I've always loved it. One would think that John Waters would have idolized this film. This film must be not only scary, but also one of the most dubious and trashy films ever made at this time. And, surprisingly, we do not hear about it by worship following a film like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" acquired over the years. He has a cult, but he really should have become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, this came out a little before the release of Blood Feast, making it probably one of the first true "gore" movies. In fact, this film contains elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a bit of Russ Meyer for more precision. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who loves trash, sordid and black and white horror movies early 60s (I think the date at the end of the one it was 1960).
