* First of all, although many say it's the worst of the series, I do not think that's true, because it reflects the mentality of 21st century teenagers. It offers perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remember the good teenager. moments where you would have liked to have the same pleasure as the characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree that this is a teen movie but that comedy movies are not meant to be for teenagers? ... cinemas are especially the place where teenagers find themselves; Plus, seeing such a movie during a slumber party or something like that is fine for a great time. <br /> <br /> * Many comments on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... become true ... does not this reflect the thoughts of teenage boys like those of the movie? What would you like to see ... smart books, romantic stuff? it's not at all what these teenagers would have in mind ... <br /> <br /> * To conclude, I think that if you're a teenager, you absolutely must see the movie, and even if You are a real man or an adult woman, you should see if you always have an adolescent mind or if you often think about how it was adolescence, or things like that. Thanks for reading!
