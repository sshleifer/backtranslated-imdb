I gave this movie 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for Amadeus and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire more recently. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge such films without understanding the life, the mentality and a Balkan soul that Kusturica presents masterfully. To understand it, you really have to be part of the Balkans. It's an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary with his previous films, which are boring right now, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie. I love humor (humor of the Balkans), photography is an art in itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, do not remember it, but remember reading to a girl who is going to sleep a similar story.
