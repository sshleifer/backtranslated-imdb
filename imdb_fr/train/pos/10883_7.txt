It's surprisingly above the average slasher, it's nice and well done, with a little decent gore !. All the characters are correct and the story is pretty fun. Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch very well. I bought it in a pawn shop for $ 1, and it was worth it. The special effects were pretty good for the budget. Plus, I loved the mask the killer wore, because it was a little scary. The final was really cool, I loved the way they defeated the killer, and the predictable ending was very fun too, and all the characters except Ringwald were surprisingly friendly! It was written and done decently, and I thought it was pretty creative and original sometimes, and some scenes of death were very impressive. This killer did not mess around, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) should really love this movie. In addition, the film was really mean, with the shooting of the film! It's a surprisingly above-average slasher, it's nice, and well done, with a little decent gore, and I say it's well worth the watch! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall is good! Work here with a solid camera work, with a scary setting, good angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace. The acting game is solid! Molly Ringwald plays the dog extremely well, and I had a hard time feeling sorry for her. After all, she was supposed to be the heroine, she did better at the end, but not much, I'm surprised she decided to make this movie. despite everything, she did a great job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as a killer, he is threatening, scary and has a mask of hell, and this guy did not have fun, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and does very well as the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall, it's worth a look! *** out of 5
