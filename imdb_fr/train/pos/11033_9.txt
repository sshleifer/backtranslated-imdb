I do not think I'll ever understand Renny Harlin's hate. 'Die Hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most impressive action movies of all time. That's right, little punks, Cliffhanger rules, and we all know that. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former lifeguard climber who "visits" just his old town when asked to help an old friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), participate in a rescue on a mountain top. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stuck people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. they lost a lot of money that they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rockies and they would like to get it back ... <br /> <br /> Essentially, Cliffhanger is another clone of "Die Hard". Simply trade within the boundaries of Nakatomi Plaza with the mountain ranges of the Rockies, with scenes created to highlight the weaknesses of our hero and keep him deadly. Naturally, this configuration is completely destroyed, because Stallone's character easily avoids a large number of bullets and slams the face first in several walls without apparent side effects. After all, is not that the action movies? <br /> <br /> "Cliffhanger" is one of the most exciting action movies of the moment. A showcase of big scenes and waterfalls. One of the first stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie is not better than it was in the beginning, it still retains its sense of purpose. The main villain of John Lithgow is fun, and a bad guy. It is very likely that one of the meanest villains of all time. <br /> <br /> "Cliffhanger" is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, undoubtedly the best effort of Renny Harlin, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
