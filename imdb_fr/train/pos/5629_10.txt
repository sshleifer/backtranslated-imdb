I loved this great movie. Farrah Fawcett played the role phenomenally and with a good heart. She plays a woman who is pushed to the extreme to protect herself and her friends from being attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she realizes she is alone. <br /> <br /> Then one day, alone at home, the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again. Not being on the point of calling the police or taking him out, she is forced to spray it in the eyes and lock her in the fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think it is necessary to awaken the laws of the earth. They are too easy with these criminals. It is time to punish more severely.
