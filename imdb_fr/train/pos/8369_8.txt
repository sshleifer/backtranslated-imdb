Hrm-I think this sentence comes from old movie posters. <br /> <br /> It's a silly movie that seems to have been translated into a language totally unknown to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and has the text "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they must explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "in the future ..." means that instead of fighting, the nations have men Giant robots and are trying to determine, well, this is never very clear, but it's probably something very important. There are good guys (obviously the capitalists, that is "we") and bad guys (Commies!) And there are big stop-motion robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the budget for the effects was rather thin, so we do not do it. Do not see a lot of big robots. There are a lot of cheap indoor scenes, and then a big space fight towards the end. The fight in space is particularly enjoyable because it serves no purpose other than the blow to the rest of the effects budget. <br /> <br /> With this money now spent, the decisive battle degenerates into (and I do not do this high) two guys hit each other with sticks. I can still laugh in a bar by replaying the final scene, with one last line ensuring that the audience is scratching their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's stupid. That's why I bought the band.
