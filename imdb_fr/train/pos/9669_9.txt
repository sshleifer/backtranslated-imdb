After reading the original piece, I thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donal McCann achieves an exceptional performance as an audience, the repressed antagonist who is openly shown on the screen by his extroverted (but invisible to others) alterverti. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "ball game" whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched by Gar. <br /> <br /> It is really worth to rent if you can find it. (Probably not available outside of Ireland and the United Kingdom)
