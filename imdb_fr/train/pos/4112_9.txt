The title is onomatopoeia, the sound of a tram slamming on the rails. It's metaphorical for all the people who live in the dump can not have. The passing tram reflects the misery of these people and represents the relatively difficult life of the middle class. The pathos of the little boy and his beloved but sadly crazy father is very touching. This is the first color film of Kurosawa. He uses wonderfully shocking hues, colors that are only seen in dreams. The film is surreal and surpasses in beauty. Compassion for humanity is the underlying strength, but as always, Kurosawa is committed to capturing the beauty of the film. It's a masterpiece of a film genius.
