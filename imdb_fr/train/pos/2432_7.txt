I remember Casper comics, but not cartoons. Maybe they were not memorable. I do not know, but in my old age, I look at this very early animated Casper very early yesterday. Then I was shocked to read the user comments here. Have people missed the end? <br /> <br /> I have to re-learn once again that Casper does not look like other ghosts, who like going out every night and scare everyone. "He sees no future in that," according to the narrator. Instead, one night, he goes to the rural part of the city, inadvertently scares some animals and finds no friends. This brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him howling and befriends him. Both become friends but soon, the fox runs to save his life. A fox hunt is in progress. <br /> <br /> Other critics all mentioned what was going on, so I'll talk about it too. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is in tears for having lost "the only friend I ever had". But no one mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie", the fox becomes a spiritual figure like Casper, jumps on his thighs, licks his face and the narrator comments "they lived happily ever after". Both characters look delighted. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about this? It's a beautiful story with a happy ending.
