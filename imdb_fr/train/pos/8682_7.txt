I am sad to say that I do not agree with other people on this episode of Columbo. Death Take a Hand is frankly a kind of boring Columbo. After a few times, I get bored and change channels. I still like Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires her to investigate his pretty young wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she has an affair. In return, the character of Culp blackmail the woman unfaithful who plans to expose his ploy to her husband, which would ruin his career. In anger, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and placing the body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I did not care at all. Of course, Columbo understands it in the end. It's just the question of how.
