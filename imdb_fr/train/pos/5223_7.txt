It does not seem that this film managed to please many people. First, few people seem to have seen it in the first place (I stumbled by chance), and judging by the comments and ratings, those who have had a lot have not benefited much . <br /> <br /> Well, I did it. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and charm, and even though I do not consider him a great actor, I know he can be very foolish (I liked his Mr. Jones). But this performance is different. He is not pretty in this one, and he is not charming. His character is completely different from anything I've seen of him until then - old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, who for me is his best performance so far, is doing very well. I guess it's a sign of the quality of an actor doing his job if you can not imagine anyone else doing it instead - think of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day. That's how good Gere was here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was good for me too. I guess I would not have chosen to play the Danes in this role, mainly because I think she is too good for that. But she's really doing a great job, staying well with a fit Gere, which is not an easy task. Strickland offers easily the best act of support, in a part that requires a considerable scope. In fact, I think she has the key scene with Gere and Danes and it's quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> So what about the rest of the film, apart from some excellent actors? The story may not be surprisingly surprising, but it adds the story of "veterans to rookie" to who-dunnit, and adds (like Silence of the Lambs) a sense of urgency in trying to save the girl and the imminent retirement of Gere's character. All this serves as a backdrop to the development of the two main characters, who help each other to settle in their respective new stations. It's a lot to do in 100 minutes, but it's done well, and you end up taking care of the characters and what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The staging and the photography were sufficient. I could have done without modern video and video camera movements and cut-outs, but I'm an old curmudgeon, and it was not really that bad, actually, I think it contributed to the atmosphere of the movie, might have guessed, but overall, it's not a happiness. <br /> <br /> To see.
