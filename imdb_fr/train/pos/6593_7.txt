I have watched this movie twice now and I think it's good enough for the limited equipment used to create it. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory on the migration of South American pre-Cuban Indians to the islands of Polynesia through a massive fall of tall balsa trees. This documentary follows Dr. Heyerdahl and his team when they choose balsa at Equidor and float with them to the Pacific to assemble them in Peru. They embark on a 101-day maritime adventure, testing the strength of their original raft and surviving only by the means available to the natives of that time. See for yourself, a real adventure!
