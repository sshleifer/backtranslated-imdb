After seeing all the movies of Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers, etc. in the 50s, it is quite moving to see this film with a new perspective of director Ang Lee. The scene of Lawrence's attack in Kansas is awesome. The love affair between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is remarkable as a villain. All the time, this movie makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive in the next hours. Well worth a visit.
