I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best suites of all time, as if it was the best of the three Lion King movies! In the film, Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they come from and have trouble integrating, like Timon, who has trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa go in search of their dream place and find it quickly. They must also choose Simba they are raising, but they must soon choose between their dream place or help Simba to face his uncle Scar and proclaim his right as King Lion of Pride. Rock! Filled with wonderful new characters like Ma de Timon (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funny and the comedian Jerry Stiller, Ben Stiller's father, doubled it. Disney was smart to play Stiller in this role! Filled with characters, animations, stories and great music, Lion King 1 1/2 is, in my opinion, the best of any sequel and better than Simba's Pride even if I admit that I really liked that -there too! The Lion King 1 1/2 is a superb Disney suite that the whole family can enjoy! He has a good story and is very funney! 10 of 10!
