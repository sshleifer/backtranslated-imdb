No Strings Attached features Carlos Mencia standing up, which makes us laugh and think. Not only does it make fun of racial issues (as many enemies claim), but it also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally ... why Americans are crazier than Arab terrorists ... why no one needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes to do in paradise ... a theory of the birth of Easter traditions Watch movie The passion of Christ - and his sub-sequential quarrel with a woman to know if he is affected by Jesus or not ... how society should treat the physically disabled ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not . <br /> <br /> In addition, he never stops remembering that each of us has a voice. We should use it to tell the truth, to say what we think and not to be afraid of others being offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
