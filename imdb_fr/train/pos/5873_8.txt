It would have been a fire classic if they had chosen almost everyone for John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Be it comedy, drama, tearfulness, etc. He smells bad. Priyadarshan realized that too at one point and made him jump like a monkey to make his solo scenes a little funny. <br /> <br /> It's the only noticeable drawback (there is a more annoying couple) of an ABSOLUTELY hilarious film otherwise. Best comedy in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a comedy of the situation carried by a brilliant scenario and of course by Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance so far. He had better be the best actor at each ceremony. AK has always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. Body language, facial expressions and how it delivers each line. It's a genius performance. The crowded theater had gone crazy for pretty much the entire length of the film and I do not think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the United States. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala does not have a "main" heroine. It features 3 incredibly hot + beautiful girls who, I think, have done a pretty good job. I am sure they are all starting out. Paresh Rawal is solid, as usual, although his routine wears off after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his boring self (fed up with his ridiculous number in all the movies). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's really worth it. I would say it's MORE FUN than No Entry, and that says a lot. It could have been better if they had chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
