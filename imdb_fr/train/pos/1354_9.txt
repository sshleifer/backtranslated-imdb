For those interested in business and the corporate world, this show is simply the best of the best. As one of the program's former participants wrote on his blog, "Business people have finally had an audience. The whole idea is perfect. have a group of businessmen compete with each other for business-related tasks, located in the best place in the world, in New York. Donald Trump is perfect as a boss, even if his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity. It also makes a lot of questionable decisions about who to send back, which is one of the negative aspects of the series. <br /> <br /> Season 1: Great season overall, the best season of the "normal" season. This season has been the most focused on business skills. Later, the series almost drowned in marketing-related tasks with far too many product placements. Great and interesting competitors overall, with the most likeable character in this series: Troy. I know I'm not the only person to suspect that the Trump World Tower episode, where he was fired, has been resolved so that Amy and Nick win this particular task. <br /> <br /> Season 2: Also a great season. The tasks were still pretty good and there were a lot of interesting candidates. Jen M was terrible and should never have made it to the finals, IMO. Also, this season has had the worst shot ever (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: Terrible. In fact, I liked the concept of smart book against the street, but the cast was so terrible (it turned out that Trump also hated the cast) that the whole season was a total disaster. The best moments were the second episode (motel renovation), with the dismissal of PM Brian, a guy who adds only large amounts of comic value. <br /> <br /> Season 4: A great season, a lot because of the interesting content and entertaining competitors this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the total disaster named Toral). The episode "Take me to the conference room" is one of the absolute classics of this show, which ends with the famous quadruple firing. Unfortunately, I think we were stolen for the Randall vs. Final. Alla. I think Trump was afraid that she could have won, and prevented that from happening. <br /> <br /> Season 5: A boring season with nothing really special. Brent was only an embarrassment and obviously only to create drama. The tasks were terrible overall (how does creating a jingle have anything to do with business?). I guess the best man won, but personally, I do not care. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I understand why they wanted to try Los Angeles as the new location of the show. a mistake. New York will always be the perfect place for that. This season has added a lot of new, mostly terrible things (like losing the team that has to sleep outside in tents, win a PM continues to be a PM, for example). The tasks were terrible and Trump also chose the wrong winner. James deserved it without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity Edition. Best season of all time. Totally different rules (like using rolodexes), but all fun and entertaining. The biggest problem was that many competitors were not real celebrities, especially women where everyone was unknown to me, with the exception of Omarosa, who is a complete shame for all that she is involved in. It seemed to be Gene Simmon's season, but after completely ridiculing himself during the Kodak task, another man emerged from the shadows: Piers Morgan. Never has anyone dominated a season like he did. He crushed his opponents and also appeared as a guy with a great sense of humor (although some tense Americans (not all Americans, of course, do not understand me badly) unfortunately do not have the social skills to understand it). To go to PIERS !! <br /> <br /> For fans of this, I highly recommend the British version starring Sir Alan Sugar as the boss. In fact, the British version is much better, and it says something since the American (and its original) is really a big show. One thing about the British version is that candidates generally tend to behave like decent human beings in the conference room, unlike the constant screaming and rude behavior of the American version.
