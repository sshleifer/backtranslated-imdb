I first saw this when they showed it around Easter 1993/93 and did not think much about it at that time. I bought it on DVD last summer, when I started to get into Michael Jackson (I loved his music before) and I enjoyed it more now. I am older. It's a good movie but it will not be a classic movie like The Sound Of Music, The West Side Story, The Wizard Of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and the other members of the cast too. There were disturbing scenes, like that of little girl Katie being slapped by gangster Frankie Lideo played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song on the movie was Smooth Criminal, I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.
