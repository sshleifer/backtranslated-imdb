I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt to launch "The Dawn". Was a good look at how strangers try to go inside to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was well prepared and organized in an interesting way for the film to flow well. Well worth a look. My only complaint is that there did not seem to be any closure. Maybe that's part of the question. We are waiting for it, but in reality, it's not what happened (or usually happens). <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personality outside of their Canadian television show. You can see a bit of what's left to come. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see the pope's hunt.
