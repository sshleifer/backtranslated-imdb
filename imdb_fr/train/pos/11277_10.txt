Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men come looking for ivory and bring Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> It's a rarity - a sequel that's better than the original version. "Tarzan, the monkey man" of 1932 was good but had terrible special effects and dragged somehow. This one has MUCH better effects and is much more adult. There's tons of blatant racism (a black guy is shot dead - no one really cares), but it was in 1934. There was also a lot of blood, cold blood and violence (for one 1934 film) and uncut prints that Jane was doing a long, totally nude underwater swim! There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane carry almost nothing and (implicitly) they sleep together and have sex - without being married. It would not bother anyone today, but in 1934 it was pretty extreme. <br /> <br /> That aside, the film is well done, very fast, full of adventures and thrills. See Weissmuller in this lean-skinny cloth is certainly a feast for the eyes and Jane's outfit is also quite revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everyone is OK. <br /> <br /> It's easily the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan. Good to see but not for children!
