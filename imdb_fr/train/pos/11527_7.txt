Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in this biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter dating from 1940 which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley in Lou Payne and a fine selection of support players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains offer magnificent performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter. Rains is great because the flamboyant and selfish producer / screenwriter / actor / impresario, David Belasco, one of the big names in theater. <br /> <br /> Although Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, was the advisor for this film, it is a poor representation of the real events in Carter's life. Admittedly, there had been a highly publicized and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly considered a scandalous character for her and to become an actress. However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no battle for custody. Once she broke with Belasco, she did not return. In fact, she started working in vaudeville and actually shot movies towards the end of her life. She married Lou and became his main character in many productions. <br /> <br /> Ms. Carter's driving force at the beginning of this film was to regain control of her son, but she finally realized that far from him, he is intimately related to his father. In the film too (and I do not know if it was true in real life), she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical hostel, which gives the film an interesting and additional atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a representation of the greatness of Carter or Belasco. One of Carter's most famous moments was The Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot braids. Outside the stage, fans shaved her hair as she hung above the stage, gripping the center of a bell to keep it from ringing. All a visual.
