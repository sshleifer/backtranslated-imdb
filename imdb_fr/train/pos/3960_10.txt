According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It's a bit difficult to take Mats Helge's films seriously as most of his films are shot on a very tight budget. Almost no USD at all. But it is fascinating to establish that Mats Helge finally ends something that can be called an action movie. The mission Ninja is - I think - the best among all the films made by him. Some special effects are very nice. This is not a movie "B" or "C". It's a movie "Z" - but a movie "Z" nice and fun!
