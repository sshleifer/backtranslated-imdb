For me, low-budget science fiction has something so appealing and nostalgic. Like a child in the 50's that's all there was. In 1957, I saw "The first man in space" in a movie theater with my father. There was Marshall Thompson in the main role and another poor slob who had the lead role. It's also a space mission that went awry and the astronaut turns into a grizzly bear killer. I was afraid of good and abundance. The memory of these heebie-jeebies still lives in me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a re-make only in glorious colors ... this is where the scenes are well lit. I just have to like it for what it is ...... a little over an hour of dark scenes, disgusting noises and that strange music. Bravo!
