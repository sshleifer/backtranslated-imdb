This film stars Jay Leno as a Detroit policeman, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo policeman sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen car engine prototype. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit in the hope of selling him to a fast-growing car company run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him, the men who were supposed to negotiate the agreement killed him and took the prototype. Derek Jarryd, angry, tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras, who led the two men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none and threatens Jarryd to force him to continue his partnership. Meanwhile, in the same shipyard where the Japanese had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend was watching the scrap yard. <br /> <br /> Tony goes in search of the murderer against the order of his superior. Tony is on the flight while it is obvious that the homicide should investigate the case. While Tony investigates the crime, he clashes with the Japanese policeman and stops him by mistake. Eventually, they end up working together on the case. They make a strange pair and present really funny scenes as well as ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and hitting through the windshield of a moving car and striking Madras in the head. But it ends up being a nice movie between friends, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is nice in the role and Pat Morita is also good. Yet they make one of the most unlikely police mates duo in an action movie. If you like boyfriend buddy movies, nerdy 1980s movies or if you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
