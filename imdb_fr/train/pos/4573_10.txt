Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he gets into each of the characters he plays to make them real. <br /> <br /> I remember, many years ago, we organized a party at our place - friends came, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, laughing - enjoy. The television was on - there was a movie we did not pay much attention to. Then, all of a sudden, we all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not flap, the forks did not move, the food became cold on the plates. We could not leave the eyes of the big screen where the crippled young man, whose whole body was against him and who only controlled his left foot, had picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and what seemed like an eternity was trying to write a word on the floor. When he finished writing this word, we all knew that we had not witnessed one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit, the triumph of the cinema that was able to capture such a moment on the film, and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character. <br /> <br /> "My left foot" by Jim Sheridan is a captivating and unenthusiastic bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man born of cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and who found the love of his life. <br /> <br /> I like all the performances of Day Lewis (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY) but I think his biggest role was Christy Brown in "My left foot"
