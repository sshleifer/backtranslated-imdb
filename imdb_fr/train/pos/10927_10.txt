This is one of my favorite kungfu movies and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers of the late '70s. The plot is interesting and winding, the characters are nice, everyone with his own style - toad, snake, lizard, etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies displaying different characters. I recommend this film to those who think that all of Shaw Brothers' films, especially those of Chang Cheh, are identical, with most of his films generally focusing on the 10 tigers and the Shaolin vs. Manchu conflicts. This film is a breath of fresh air in comparison.
