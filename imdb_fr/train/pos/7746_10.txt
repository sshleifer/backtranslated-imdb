Those of you who know the group know US singer Tom Barman. He made this film a bit like he was creating music, it's a mix of everything. It's a comedy, although mostly absurd and cynical, a drama, none of the main characters have a happy life to say the least, and it does not really have a purpose. <br /> <br /> The film begins on a Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes from several people, some having nothing in common, they meet day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that no one reads, a morbid young researcher of death and his sister, a gallerist, two young men constantly in contact with the law, a man who works in a movie theater and two young women. Throughout the film walks a man who has something to do with the wind. All the characters have problems, with their family, their friends or just with life itself. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in Antwerp and presents several beautiful shots of the city and the port. The events of the day are not easy to explain, I advise to watch the film, there is simply too much to tell. But I can say that Barman uses the camera very well and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock) to create an atmosphere, especially the party is filled with excellent music. <br /> <br /> This film is an experience in itself, it will not leave you wiser in life, maybe only that you have to live it and not waste it, or have no false moral truths . <br /> <br /> In short, to see it, it's really worth it!
