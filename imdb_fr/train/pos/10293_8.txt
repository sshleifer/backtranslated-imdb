"Bruce Almighty" will sweep the Oscars with a record 14 wins on an Oscar! It will surpass Titanic as the most profitable movie of all time! Jim Carrey will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the White House playoffs in 2004. Almighty then! These fantasies of greatness would only materialize if the filmmakers (including Carrey) possessed the powers of God. This same principle is the key ingredient in Carrey's new emotion: "Bruce Almighty". Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television journalist who is so obsessed with the main anchor that he blames God for his total guilt for his own mishap. God, embodied by Morgan Freeman in Heaven, bestows on Bruce the "Gift of God" (His powers) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Clearly, Bruce lets himself be dragged along with his new blessed faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his usual all-powerful comic form in "Bruce Almighty." Jennifer Aniston was not "bad" as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my congratulations to the Prime Minister go to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for second place and showing us the hilariest bathroom scene of all time! "Bruce Almighty" is not Carrey's most in-depth film, but it's still an all-powerful, chuckling exhibition of "Carreyism"! **** Well
