A very promising director's debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller / who-really-does it recommend by Stephen King. This is a strong and well-crafted horror tale about a pious but insane man in Thurman, Texas, who embarks on a murderous madness after receiving God's command to eliminate the demons who are trying to control humanity. Some twists and a disturbing finale are worth it. Most acts of violence that you do not really see, but are still enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays the crooked man who will be called the killer of God's hand. Matthew McConaughey is just as impressive as the eldest son of the madman who tells this story to a Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Suspensory white punch! Highly recommended.
