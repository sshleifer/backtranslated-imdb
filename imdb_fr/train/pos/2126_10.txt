You can learn a lot about love and life by looking at people at the shop around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this charming film. With a sparkling dialogue (courtesy of long-time collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and marvelous performances of an extremely talented cast of actors, he created a truly memorable film. Always convinced to play with the intelligence of his viewers and privilege the refinement in slapstick, the director has concocted a scintillating film meal seasoned with this elusive and enigmatic quality known as the "Lubitsch touch". <br /> <br /> the story takes place in Budapest (and there is a tangle of accents among players), it does not matter. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any big city or small American city could easily be the place of action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are wonderful because employees love romance and then with each other. other - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so skillfully managed that it seems quite natural - perfectly reflects their confusion and despair as they search for soulmates. This is one of the classic love stories of cinema. <br /> <br /> The cherub Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose ephemeral importance in his small world has broken when he is a cuckold. An accomplished stage thief, he lets no emotion escape. In addition, Morgan gives the film its happiest moments - towards the end of the film - when it determines that the last employee of his shop, a poor young man, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds another living representation to his list of representations on the screen, this time that of a sycophanic Lothario, a scout, who deserves the punishment he finally suffered. Sweet Felix Bressart has his best role in the movies as a father who can not really afford to get involved in store intrigue, while remaining a staunch friend of Stewart. <br /> <br /> Sara Haden honors the small role of a salesman. . William Tracy is hilarious as an ambitious racing boy who takes advantage of unplanned developments to make his mark in the sales force. <br /> <br /> In small roles, Charles Halton plays the role of a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell is pompous. doctor. The film legends will recognize Mary Carr and Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their unique scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother and aunt.
