The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because few movies, in my opinion, are perfect. This small image B is a tense story, well told. Alexander Knox has always intrigued me, but I have seen very few films. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without an ounce of remorse. This performance is one of the scariest I have ever seen. Since the Second World War, actors who have played Nazis or other evil types in movies have been nominated for Oscars at times. I imagine that since it was done during the war, the Academy felt like honoring such a performance would have been like honoring the evil. But Knox offers this kind of performance: a man so bitter and so surrounded that he does not think to hurt others. I still can not overcome the problem. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays Filbert's gibbet or the social butterfly, is playing the counter-strike probably the best performance I've ever seen. Maybe not worthy of Oscars, but the best of his career. Nothing against her; I appreciated her in these "light" roles that she often played. But here she proves that she is up to a heavier tragedy. <br /> <br /> If you love stories of human drama, or those about the fate of those who have suffered from the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this beautiful little movie.
