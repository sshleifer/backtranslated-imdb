I saw this film for the first time when I was about seven and I was completely thrilled by it, but I could not find the name of the film for years. now I'm twenty-one and I stumbled upon the film about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the movie was a little blurry, I was never disappointed by what I saw. the animation of this film is superb, evoking a world so credible and so animated that you are attracted to the film by this one. But this film also has a plot that will delight and entertain adults and children. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-constructed love story, this movie will not let you down I would recommend this movie to anyone.
