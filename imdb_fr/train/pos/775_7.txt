It's a strange and impressive story about love. Personally, I never had to tell a story so diverted in real life. But, I can imagine it. <br /> <br /> It's a story that promises to be "sick" of the title. But after looking at it, I did not feel the sense of "illness" that I would surely have with the rules of society. It's something beautiful in this film ... something impressive ... that I can not contradict any moral or social rule. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, evolves and finally ends. You feel the moment when this love blooms, the first murmurs, the touching. You feel the connection. And no moment, I think it's immoral. You even hope it will not break in the end ... it can not break ... it's not ok. You feel the pain of being hurt in the end ... <br /> <br /> But I must also add a negative twist to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not in some way so * showed * to give the feeling that these relations are sick only by form, but not by content. You do not have the whole story, only fragments. When the movie started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, no clue to the nature of the relationship. You only feel a tension between them ... a struggle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line from Kiki to Sandu says it all: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do what I ask you". <br /> <br /> This film will probably raise questions about what is love and what has to be moral ... and where is the line between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love overcomes everything ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how and where". But in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason that it makes you think ...
