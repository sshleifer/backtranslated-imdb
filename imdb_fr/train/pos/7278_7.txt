Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that grab you and do not let you down until the end, especially when you see it as a kid. Seeing the film as an adult, it must be admitted that it is not so scary that everything, but the story is very fascinating and contains many large mysterious scenes (especially those with the scary mummy) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes of the film is undoubtedly the scene with grandfather and grandmother in their new RV; the scene with the rocks is very exciting and quite scary. Also, the scenes where the main character discovers her mother's secret are quite frightening. <br /> <br /> Okay, the game in the movie is not so great and the movie sometimes seems a little boring, but overall The ghosts that still work are fun. Too bad that only a few people have seen this film, this film really deserves better. I just want to say: Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all of you, Hollywood producers; If you want to redo a movie, redo this one!
