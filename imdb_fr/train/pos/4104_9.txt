It helps if you understand Czech and you can see it in the original language and understand the obsession of the Czechs with "Professionals", but otherwise, "Jedna ruka netlaska" is yet another great Czech film. It's funny, dark and extremely pleasant. The biggest compliment I can make is that you never know what's going to happen next and you keep that feeling right down to the second and third screenings. <br /> <br /> For a small country, the Czech Republic has an incredible amount of world-class films and literature, ranging from Hrabal to Hasek and Kundera to films by Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor, by its very nature, is dark and often uncompromising, but often with a na√Øve and warm feeling. This film is just that, it is nasty and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings, but below all that, there is a beautiful story full of promise, good intention and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. and most other projects involving Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy it, it's a film made for this reason. Anyway, it's as close as the Czechs will manage to write a really happy ending ...
