As others have mentioned, all the nude women in this movie are for the most part absolutely gorgeous. The plot shows very well the hypocrisy of the female libido. When the men are around, they want to be pursued, but when no "man" is there, they become the pursuers of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a very fast man (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then takes the courage to pursue his true love.
