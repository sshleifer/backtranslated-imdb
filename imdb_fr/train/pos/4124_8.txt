Lloyd Bridges like Mike Nelson and his boat were all stars of this series. What made me so good when I looked at it was the real sensation of going underwater. The show features a youth energy energy for underwater exploration that is contagious. <br /> <br /> The show was educational and also showed things about scuba diving from someone who seemed to be an accomplished professional, Mike Nelson. There were excellent shows and the program always seemed well produced. Certainly, the drama in the scripts sometimes hits the same notes in more than one episode, but each show has its own characteristics with any other show produced at that time, the childhood of American television.
