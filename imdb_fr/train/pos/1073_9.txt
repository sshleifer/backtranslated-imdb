It took us some episodes to "get into" Dark Angel as a story and a series, since we were making the transition from The Sopranos, a very different mentality setting. But once we understood the essence of the series, we were quickly hooked. It's unfortunate that the series ends at the very moment when it was in the excellent category: Dark Angel was much more than your average television series. It moves your ass and it hits as much as the action, but the characters' interactions and society's reactions to the "mutants" remind us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. The fact that the story unfolds in the future maintains the surrealist atmosphere and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed in our face (thus not spoiling the "pleasure" of those who do not like to be commented on an entertainment), but each event and the interaction man / society remains relevant for the present. We all make judgments, face our own prejudices, but in the end, the question of who you are is: do you stand back and close your mind, or do you stand up and do yourself some thing? For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series reinforces them. For those who have never had to face the question, this series "sneaks" into this message under the pretense of pure action entertainment. It is much more well done and well written than most television series; I am very disappointed that this ends before it really gets to the next level.
