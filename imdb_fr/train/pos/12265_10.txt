"Tintin and I" at first seemed like a documentary masterpiece. Photography and editing are really breathtaking (almost anti-dogma). <br /> <br /> We follow the life of the designer Tintin Hergé through an open interview of 1971. The series Tintin was drawn in the background of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these, Hergé has his own demons with whom to fight, and much of his drawing activity seems to be an attempt to tame them and escape into a world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of Tintin albums drawings, reconstructions and readings of album passages, the story of Hergé is told entirely through interviews and archival documents, and never by reconstructions. <br /> <br /> Hergé lived the tumultuous life of a true suffering artist. But the fantasy world from his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again.
