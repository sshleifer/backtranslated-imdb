Whenever I see Nicole, I love her more. I like a movie like this. A woman you just will not give up on, but she continues to break your heart. I remember that the first film like this was Of Human Bondage, Kim Novak's version - Laurence Harvey. The nonsense about the accuracy of the Russian spoken in this film is petty, it was good enough to deceive me or someone who does not speak Russian, I'm sure. It's funny how people miss the point. The non-goodnik Russians were also well chosen. Finally, I must salute Ben Chaplin, as someone said, he plays the sap with great dignity and there was really heat between him and Nicole. To think, guys are paid for it, mind-blowing.
