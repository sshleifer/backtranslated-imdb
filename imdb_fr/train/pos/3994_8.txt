I went to this film only because I was dragged there and I would have left immediately because the audience was mostly elderly and I felt out of place. However, the film was quite fascinating and far from meant for the elderly. The characters were all very real and believable and I found myself discussing the film, the characters and the screenplay for hours. There are some pretty captivating scenes, but they are necessary and help you better understand the situation. Overall, it's a great and valuable film - a bit out of the mainstream, but that does not mean that people who prefer the general public can not enjoy it. It's an exciting and interesting movie experience.
