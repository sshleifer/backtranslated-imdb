The hard-hitting film of four city-dwellers in crisis in the Appalachians has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of the four businessmen is confronted with his darkest fears when it comes to a difficult white-water journey on a river about to be replaced by a dam. When the inhabitants of the country decide to "fend for themselves" with the intruders, this results in many deaths and many traumas for the survivors. Each of the travelers is remarkable, although Voight gives the lead and the best performance. The landscape and rural culture are well captured, including the breathtaking sequence of banjos. I saw this at a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). I kind of remember that dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already established. This is not the kind of movie you could watch every week, but it has a big impact and is beautifully filmed.
