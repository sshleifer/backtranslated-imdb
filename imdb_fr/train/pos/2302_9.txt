The first release of Reese Witherspoon on the big screen was memorable. She appears as a fresh and slightly pinched face, but undeniably Reese. <br /> <br /> I have always loved her as an actress and I did not know she had started so young with her career. In fact, I gained Reese's respect for who she was so early. I say that because every time I watched her play, the characters so far, in every performance, she also seemed to have her own personality that lived with that character, very well actually. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first The movie with Reese was the parody of Little Red Riding Hood that Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, but I thought it was his first time "at the bat". Not so good, bravo Reese
