Imagine that I was about to miss this great cultural event on Swedish television last night, and it was only because my girlfriend absolutely wanted the TV to stay on (so she could fall asleep more easily! ) I had already seen an advertisement for this, but of course I had forgotten it and I was looking forward to an "advanced night" ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway - it must surely be a rather unusual idea - to found a documentary film about an interview with the sound there is only more than 30 years. But with animated films and other documentaries, this is a very good and insightful portrait of one of the most beloved literary artists of the twentieth century - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> <br /> I will definitely read my Tintin albums with a different eye after watching this movie, which makes it easier to connect variations of style and content with the different periods of Hergé's life (and I can tell you that I will immediately get the little that I do not know to have). Of course, my perception of albums has changed for more than 25 years now that I read them, as well as my vision of albums that I prefer, but it adds (at least) an extra dimension.
