Ten of the 11 short films in this film are masterpieces (I found it disappointing that the Egyptian one). Although the Mexican director has chosen to describe the problems of individuals or groups in relation to September 11: Afghan refugees, deaf, Palestinians, widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and bath ensuing bloodshed, suicide bombings in Israel, paranoid American Muslims persecuted by the state in the United States, elderly people living alone and the aftermath of the Second World War in the hearts of Asian soldiers. It can say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both directions: the filmmakers might think that Americans ignore the pain of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they do the same with their short films. Surprised myself, I found Sean Penn's piece among the best in the collection, and *** SPOILER AHEAD ***, I'm also guessing his portrait of Ernest Borgnine as a crazy half-mad old man vegetating a New York apartment knowing the happiest moment of his widow's life, when the sun shines through his window after the WTC "collapsed in the dark", I guess it could also be one of the most shocking to the American public.
