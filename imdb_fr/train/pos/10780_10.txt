Far from my second favorite cartoon, Spielberg did it after Animaniacs. Even though the odds were low, so I always liked and loved it, it was so funny and I love the casting, wow, Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and were fantastic, the whole cast was brilliant, in especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this caricature again, it was great and the jokes were great. Also, I remember the hilarious moment when Brain appeared in the cameos, we heard his voice and he played the theme of PATB, it was fantastic, I love in these cartoons where cameos appear. I wish this cartoon and Animanacs come back, I loved them
