Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a sequel, I love Jaq and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was inspired. I like to write stories myself and I hope it will encourage children. The three stories are cute and fun, although the songs have been forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also liked to see Lucifer, Bruno, the choir of the mouse and all the rest. Pom Pom was Lucifer's perfect companion and I liked the housekeeper. A suite well done to change. My rating 8/10.
