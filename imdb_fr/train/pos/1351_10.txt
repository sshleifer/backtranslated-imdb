Lively and irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unexpected happiness to the life of an isolated senior sister and brother of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved novel comes to life in this wonderful film. Excellent production values, a literate script and first-class performance give the story the quality touch it deserves. <br /> <br /> Taking her professional name from the character she has portrayed, actress Anne Shirley is a joy led by a 14-year-old orphan who completely changes the lives of her new guardians. Completely reassured in her lead role, Miss Shirley is a delight, entertaining the viewer with Anne's boundless imagination, keen temper, and not so secret sorrows. <br /> <br /> Play the old girl who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also completely controls her role; the spectator will be pleased to see this woman with a sharp tongue slowly detach herself from Anne's affection and childlike innocence. Australian actor OP Heggie performs one of his best roles as Westley's timid and kind brother who welcomes Anne into his heart from the moment he picks her up at the station. <br /> Tom Brown plays pleasantly with the schoolboy who quickly catches Anne's attention. Sara Haden is neatly piquant like a curious neighbor. Charley Grapewin takes full advantage of his few moments as Avonlea's doctor.
