I'm not aware of "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a graphic novel?), But I must admit that when I hear about an agent / hero movie, I was expecting something different than I actually had. <br /> <br /> While it was surprising to see this at first, it was good to watch this move. You can never really know where this is going to go (some twists are predictable, but in general you can never really say, if it will eventually go). A more than stellar performance from the main actor and a very good support cast make it a nice watch. Not as excited as some people expect or expect for such a movie, but a really good mix.
