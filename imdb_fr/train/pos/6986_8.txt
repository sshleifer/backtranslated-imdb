If you are looking for facts about UFOs, then this video is very important. The "meat" of the video are the comments of Buzz Aldrin. It is without a doubt the best of America. Trained to be objective, honest and factual in his reports. Many American astronauts from all ages have reported some kind of UFO contact or observance and videos of some of these missions. At the very least, something has happened that requires new objective and ongoing investigations. I think this testimony by Buzz Aldrin shows that other worlds may be interested in our progress. Like any supposed documentary video, it may be skewed, but it contains additional information and opinions from an accomplished American hero. These do not come every day. Therefore, the fact that some people are not interested in details should not prevent you from viewing this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I recommend you to look with an open mind.
