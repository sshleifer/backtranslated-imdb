Warning: light spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith is an incredible - and even moving - episode in American history and religious history around the world. This film describes the events of Joseph Smith's life, which Mormons venerate as the prophet of the re-establishment of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. I have already seen the film twice during its first month of public screening. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith is the first to be shown the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. The operation, carried out without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. The scene showed the cohesion of the Smith family and the bonds that unite the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> The religious confusion of Joseph and the prayers that followed resulted in what Mormons call The First Vision was presented in an interesting way. . The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the undeniable marks of the nails in his hands. The rejection of Joseph and Emma by Joseph's marriage softened at least the rejection of religious leaders and many members of his small community in New York. <br /> <br /> This film does not clearly describe the events in the history of the Mormon Church. stage to stage. This is not a criticism, it is simply a note on the style. <br /> <br /> The practice of tar and feathers is shown, and it is particularly dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon on the Savior's love with a marked face after being recently attacked. <br /> <br /> The film brilliantly portrays the joy and growth of Mormonism as an emerging church, while opposing an increasingly deep opposition that spreads to the heights of local governments. The film features many scenes from Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments illustrating his relationship with Emma. We try to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his endless love for children, his spirit, his courage in the face of dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings and his compassion. <br /> <br /> While Joseph and Hyrum travel to Carthage without ever returning home alive, most of the characters in the entire film, whose lives had been touched by Joseph, are shown throughout the journey, which helps to reinforce already seen but the final scene is more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is described and the spectators are left to the spectator to meditate on the events they have just witnessed. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie for the first time, I assumed it was done by the church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I do not think it's the case anymore, although I hope the film can do it. As an insider, I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and remarkably reinforces the good things we already know about him. I'm curious to see how foreigners will see the film - if they will just see it as a propaganda, an epic story of an American religious or something else. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully shot, ideal for families. , moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that the events described are really happening in these United States of America in light of many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and (usually) respect for the law - that we moderns take for granted.
