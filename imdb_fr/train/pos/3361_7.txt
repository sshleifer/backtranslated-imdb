I intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of Marcello Mastroianni with many unvisited films I own on VHS; However, given my light Christmas marathon, I had to settle for this one! It happens to be one of his best performances - and he was rightly nominated for the Oscars (the film itself being also honored). It was also one of 14 collaborations with this other famous Italian star, Sophia Loren; incidentally, both play against the guy here - she's a homely housewife and he's a homosexual! <br /> <br /> By the way, the title of the film has a double meaning: the main characters are gathered on the historic day when Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself being presented in long archive footage). , but it refers more specifically to the "brief encounter" of stars in which they share moments of friendship, revelation and, briefly, passion - although everyone knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable, which leads to the abrupt and sweet end of the film. It's practically a two-handed game (with all the other characters - with the exception of the intrepid concierge of the building in which the story unfolds in its entirety - which includes the gruff and fiercely patriotic husband of Loren, played surprisingly by John Vernon, appears only at the beginning and ending sequences); However, the cramped framework does not dissuade the director Scola (for information, this is the seventh film I saw and I still have 3 others on VHS) and the director of photography Pasqualino De Santis, so that the result The key - is far from stagnant: the camera is allowed to roam the different sections of the tall building, observing the procedure in an intimate or impartial manner as needed, but always fiercely. <br /> <br /> The story, of course, depends entirely on the performance of the two stars to be convincing, and they both deliver (their chemical composition on the screen is quite incomparable); It is interesting to note, however, that while Loren won the prizes at home, he is a moving but unenthusiastic outsider to Mastroianni (the film, somewhat dubiously, seems to equate his sexual deviance with anti-fascism!) which has generally impressed the international audience!
