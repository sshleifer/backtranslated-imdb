In Brazil, in the 1950s, the age restrictions for films were as follows: no restrictions, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Westerns were usually allowed to stay at the age of 10, when they had a little more violence, they were 14 years old, but it was rare to see a restricted western for under 18s. Winchester 73 is one of them, which explains very well how this film was considered different from the average. The hero, James Stewart, was fighting his own brother who had killed their father. He sought revenge and seemed rather traumatized, far from the good guy. Anthony Mann has tried variants of this type of character in his upcoming films with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the main woman was far from virtuous, she followed closely the man who remained with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those big bad guys that will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the rifle, is one of the best suited to a western. It had to be turned into a film by Fritz Lang, which was not revealed. When he was offered to Mann, he made a point of starting from scratch and taking nothing for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different western style, while maintaining his traditions. Winchester is always a good movie to review again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression he made to those who saw it when it was released.
