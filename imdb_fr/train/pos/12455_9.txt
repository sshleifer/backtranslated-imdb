I watched this show when I was a little girl. Although I do not remember much, I must say it was a very good show. Moreover, I do not think I have seen all the episodes. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I vaguely remember the theme song. Everyone was ideally thrown, the costume was awesome. The performances were also excellent. I just hope some networks will bring this series back one day so I can see all the episodes. Before closing, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory, even though I do not think I have seen all the episodes. In conclusion, when and if this show is put back on the air, I hope you catch it one day before its final disappearance of the show.
