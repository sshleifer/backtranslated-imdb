"Deliverance" is one of the best-selling movies of this wonderful decade of the '70s, which saw so many other films of exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of friends leaving for a canoe trip on a river in the south and they are the target of many people trying to ruin their lives. It's awesome. <br /> <br /> We are treated for anal rape, vicious beatings, bow and arrow killings, shootings, broken bones, etc. A bit like "1974 Chainsaw Massacre", to say that "Deliverance" is credible would be immature. This would never happen and could never happen, even in the dark era of 1972. <br /> <br /> "Rescue" is a very entertaining hike and full of activities. It is one of the many films of exploitation of the beginning of the 70's. It is (undoubtedly) above this pile of films with an excellent interpretation, a superb cinematography and an excellent writing. <br /> 8 out of 10, kids.
