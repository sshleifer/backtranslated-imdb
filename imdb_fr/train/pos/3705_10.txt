I do not understand the low rating of 5.7 attributed to this film. It is a delight for people who like suspenseful intrigues and dark atmospheres. The tone is reminiscent of Midnight in the garden of good and evil, to the surrounding area (Savannah). The acting is strong and I was surprised by the likelihood of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is efficient in a small part and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Great scene completely naked of her too. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly classic but effectively executed.
