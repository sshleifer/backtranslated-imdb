I'm not going to lie, it's a good movie. I saw it about 4 months ago in my local theater. I saw it a second time and I was a little bored in the slow scenes. Sid (laziness) is not very flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is remarkable and the story ends in a touching way. It's worth taking children 10 and under, but teens would probably find it a little boring. In addition, the uniqueness of the characters is so interesting. As I said, it's a very good movie, but I would say more "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek". 8/10
