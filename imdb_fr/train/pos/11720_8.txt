I was not expecting much and, to be honest, I did not like this movie the first time but I watched it again and realized it was pretty cool. Of course, it's a movie of a joke but it's a funny gag. <br /> <br /> Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. I think this movie had the potential to be a My cousin Vinny nightmare. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, it's a missed opportunity. With just a little more writing, this could be a classic. Children are underutilized, there is no reason for them to focus on Elvira. Apart from the obvious reasons. It would have been great to see their relationship flourish. I know it's a comedy, but these are small differences that separate good movies from brilliant ones. <br /> <br /> Elvira herself is always fun and engaging. Not to mention flirty. Every time she smiles, you too. It's hard to hit a movie when the main character is so charming. And that's really her charm, do not let her seem to deceive you into believing she's some sort of pie. Well she is. But she's a nice guy. The kind of person you would leave with your children. I would not let her cook for them, however ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend trying it. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> She is more than a beautiful set of tits. She is also an amazing pair of legs.
