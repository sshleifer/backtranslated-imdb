I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that strikes you is the refreshing format, which, although similar to many other reality TV shows at the base, is still very entertaining. Donald Trump is as wonderful as the host and the main judge in the series. The cast shot with smart people having a beautiful appearance being chosen as candidates is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is in New York. Mark Burnett may have done a lot of nonsense in his day, but his management of the cinematography is excellent because it gives New York the character of a full-fledged character. The jazz tunes associated with exceptional photographic work give New York a spectacular appearance. <br /> <br /> The apprentice will always make my top 3 reality TV shows of all time (The Amazing Race is No. 1, however). But just like the incredible race, this show is always better watched in moderation. If you continue to watch for a moment, the originality of the series will dissipate quickly (the same case as for TAR). Star World, the broadcasters of this country, have done a remarkable job in presenting the series. The first three seasons followed one another and after two years the two following seasons kept the concept alive. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first two seasons. However, if you continue to watch the show continuously, its charm will be attenuated and FAST.
