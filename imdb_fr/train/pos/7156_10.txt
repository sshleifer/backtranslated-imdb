Holes is a great movie. I like it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. This is one of the few films produced by Disney that is not nerdy. Holes is usually a very cool movie. I wish Disney made more pictures like that. Holes is indeed a rare species of Disney flicker shows that is cool. Do not make a bad idea, I do not mean to say bad word to Disney, but most of these things are for kids and that's OK. Kids deserve to have their entertainment too. But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teenage audience, which usually fails. But not with holes. This is the type of movie that anyone, no matter how old, can watch and enjoy and do not think about it once. Really, this is the kind of movie that even a lot of young moviegoers can appreciate because it contains characters with whom they can relate. <br /> <br /> Holes does a good job being a mix of good family fun but not being too nerdy and living a little on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy movies like this one.
