Not only does this movie have one of the biggest movie titles, but it is also animated by the third team of 70's children's actors, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. I remember this movie aired Halloween week in 1978 against Linda Blair in Stranger in our House. I missed it in the first round by choosing to see the other movie. Later, I repeated that I had made the right choice. The film is not really bad, but really lacks chills or surprises. Although I liked the scene where Richard Crenna pulls on the family dog ​​in vain.
