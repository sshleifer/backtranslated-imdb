I do not understand what fans like that did not like in this movie. It was really fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with the critics and voters of the IMDB, but not this time. I waited until the video arrived at home, which, in my opinion, was another reason why I would not appreciate the movie. I think the special effects films have to be seen on the big screen, but again, that was not the case. For me, the film requires a comparison with two films that came out at about the same time. Blair Witch and the mummy. The two films that I found terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The mother made lots of money and it was purely chaotic. People liked it for its special effects. Movies like The Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, but look more like fun rides. Well, with this analogy, the mummy was a B-ticket for the Haunting's e-ticket.
