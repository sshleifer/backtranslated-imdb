If you like CB4, you have no idea what you are missing if you have not seen this movie yet. This film is completely hilarious and incorporates much more on the hip-hop industry than any other parody film ... It is unfortunate that this film was not released on DVD because it is a film with which everyone I l I have never seen loved and wanted a copy. If you really want to laugh and you like hip hop and you know a little old artists, rent this movie. There are not many video rental locations that have copies, but if you encounter one, you will not be disappointed.
