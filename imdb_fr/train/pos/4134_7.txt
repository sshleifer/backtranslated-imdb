Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes play in "The Divorce of Lady X", a 1938 comedy based on a play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, while the London fog is too dense for guests to go to a costume ball can go home. The next day, his friend, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) has spent the night with another man in the same hotel and wants to divorce. Believing that the woman was Oberon, Olivier panicked. Oberon, a single and granddaughter of judge, claims to be the lady in question, Lady Mere, while she is actually Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We've seen this plot or variants of it dozens of times. With this cast, it's delicious. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, this great team at Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is terribly handsome and does a great job with comedy as he represents the nervous and tense advocate. Oberon gives his role the right light touch. She looks extremely young here, wider in front, with Jean Harlow's eyebrows and a very different hairstyle for her. She wears beautiful city clothes, although her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and in a dress she tries, with this headdress, she is ready to play Snow White. Binnie Barnes is lovely as a true Mother Lady. <br /> <br /> The color is a mess and, as others have mentioned, it could really require a restoration. Well worth a visit.
