Brutal, without emotion, Michael Myers stabbed his sister at the age of six on Halloween night in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escaped from a psychiatric institution and instituted a new reign of terror in his home town of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is being pursued all the time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows how perverse this young man is. <br /> <br /> It starts with brilliance and introduces a truly atmospheric and suspense cooler that is truly superior. to the many slasher images she inspired. It is subtle compared to the unpleasant blood baths of many of these later films; subtle and scary. It retains the ability to blow me up even after repeated viewing. How many films are there really that can continue to scare even after seeing them? Not very many. <br /> <br /> Pleasure is great in what was probably the definitive role of her career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her film debut, became a true queen of scream after playing in "Halloween" as well as in some other slasher images. She is therefore a victim who deserves to be encouraged. <br /> <br /> Co writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of dark shadows and skies; notice how much the film takes place after dark. With this picture, he and his former associate, Debra Hill, created a franchise that spawned seven sequels, many imitators and an imminent "re-imagining". <br /> <br /> This is very remarkable - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis Speech (Pleasence) in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, reputed actor of the repertoire in several previous works of Carpenter)? <br /> <br /> It's fantastic and deserves to be discovered. It's my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time. <br /> <br /> It's not totally foolproof - there are holes in the scripts, after all - but overall, it produces a solid impact. <br /> <br /> 9 / ten
