The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here, Mia visits her parent for her father's birthday, which sometimes still has a kind of tragedy. The question is what will it be this year and you will be surprised ... It is an extremely well composed film, with a story that has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You are happy, you hurt yourself and, basically, everything else. Finally, you can not help but fall in love with Mia (if you're a boy (the lead actress)). She is an extremely well-chosen actress, as are many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
