I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so arresting and terrifying ... just like the second part of the pilot ... I will definitely continue to watch this show! It's the real survivor! I watched some of the other comments and I can see that after one or two episodes already, the morons scream wolf ... Sorry if this is not another reality show, children! Once upon a time there was ... now get ready! Real TV shows! And this one is actually good unlike most crappy sitcoms today or the tenth carbon copy of a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI series that they distribute ... Look at this yourself to make your own opinion, do not do it Do not take one of the bones here!
