A beautiful postcard of New York. What I liked most was being able to watch this with all my family and not wait until the stupid humor of the toilet appeared. It never did. My teenagers loved it too. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and that everyone was enjoying something. This film tells a story that seems comfortable but is neither old nor finished. The end came with a twist that we all loved too. If you're not just a cynical person and you're ready to let a story unfold, it's for you. As a guy, it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did it. I recommend it and we need more of these movies to watch.
