The world of dragon hunters is a world challenged by 3D gravity. Planetoids, pieces of buildings and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling can not be found. It's a world that has nothing to envy to Neverending Story, when nothing has come to eat away at the world. <br /> <br /> Funny enough, the bad guy here is also the Global Gobbler. This time, it's a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. The heroes are a great taciturn warrior, a troublesome and greedy companion managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal. They are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who, to my great sorrow, did not die of a horrible death, painful and, hopefully, early. <br /> <br /> The animation is fantastic. Voices and sounds are top quality. Too bad the story is as simple as you can imagine. They will stop the World Gobbler, they reach it almost immediately, they undo it. The end. No real development of the character or twists. Not even those I would expect from a movie with such intrigue. <br /> <br /> In summary: it's a cute thing to watch, kids would probably appreciate it, but that's about it. No depth for this world (pun intended).
