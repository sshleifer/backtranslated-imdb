Listen, I do not care what people say because Cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie. Cypher is not, I repeat, a movie B. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say that I am a connoisseur of the best spy movies in the world and this film is nothing less than theft of luxury. I can not emphasize enough the phenomenal nature of this film. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever designed and ever made. The technology in this film is on the horizon of space-time. In fact, I must admit that Cypher surprised me completely. In fact, I recommended this film to my colleagues more than any other film. Other critics, some of whom have downplayed the film, have no idea what they are talking about. Do not listen to enemies. And in fact, for the most part, Cypher's critics have been largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie, but also a fantastic movie. Cypher is the kind of film that is so advanced and beautifully crafted that it goes beyond the minds of most critics and cynics. There is nothing wrong with Cypher, nor cheap. Again, the cinematography, the backgrounds, the technology, the scenario and the acting are all 100% better. Naturally, I will not give anything. This is not a spoiler. And although some critics claim that Cypher should have been in theaters, I think quite the opposite. Cypher is a movie that seems to have been perfect for DVD only, not in a negative way. Cypher must be the biggest underground spy movie ever. Blade Runner, 1984, Brave New World, Total Recall, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... attention! Cypher also deserves the distinction of being placed in the Hall of Fame of the 5-star Eternal Spy Film by AONN Multimedia Research. Cypher is the best counterintelligence. Hands down and hat down. Nothing is what it seems and the truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now.
