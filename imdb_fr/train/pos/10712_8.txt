This film is better described or comparable to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton's movie). But it's a less glamorous tale and more in your face. And of course here it's not the father, but his grandfather telling the stories. <br /> <br /> The narrative of the film comes and goes (the summary of the story here, at IMDb, could tell you more than you would like.) to read before watching the film). It's quite fun and engaging, even if you go from one story to another and you also have dramatic moments. It also surprises you here and there, with unexpected things. A nice little movie then, that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! : o)
