Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie. She has an incredible talent for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film in general. I really felt for her when Lindy was persecuted. She was also realistic. She became grumpy, upset and uncomfortable as the media and the government continued their relentless witch hunt. At first, I did not expect much from the film, but I was really interested in it and the film is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than expected. Sam Neill was also remarkable. it's the best job I've seen of him, and I really liked it in other movies (The Piano, for example). I gave a 7 to the film, but if I could only rate the acting, I would give him a 9.5 and a perfect 10 for Streep.
