This film was my first contact with Mr. Sica, so I really did not know what to expect. But what I saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way. <br /> <br /> The plot is not complex and shows us a life of orphaned boy found and in particular its relationship with the community of the poor who build themselves a hood of simple sheet metal houses.

But as the title of the film indicates, there is a miracle. Our character receives a wonder from his dead mother. What will he do to protect his friends and the whole built city? <br /> <br /> It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy.
