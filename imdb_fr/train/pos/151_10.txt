The film is designed to reach the audience and this film left me speechless. Beautifully photographed and well acted with a dialogue that addresses poetry, the film involves covetousness, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception. This weaves an intense canvas that made me unable to leave the screen of the eyes until the closing credits. The story is radical. Since the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War, the spectators have found themselves in front of the human rubble. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who control the screen. The support players are perfectly chosen and give a real sense of authenticity. The sets, lighting, landscapes and cinematography are wonderful. I love photography.
