This captivating story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to read on DVD years after it was released on PBS, with a sharper image and cleaner sound. My only reservations are that the plot has some improbable moments and that some of Manchester's strongest accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even missing a word here and there will not spoil the fun: the main actors are ideally interpreted. Robson Green brings to his role as a young surgeon an enigmatic smile, an unusual temperament and athletic physical appearance. He falls in love with his boss's wife at the hospital where he just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most outstanding women of 50 years imaginable. his game rivals his beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than the words how much the age difference matters to them!) Each of the secondary characters is clearly drawn and perfectly represented. The mixture of pithy dialogue and passionate excesses makes it a delicious miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you can not be improved morally by looking at "Carefree" - but you will have a lot of fun. (The sequel, which is part of the DVD package, provides a wild but satisfying two-hour ending - you will not want to miss it if you liked what happened before.)
