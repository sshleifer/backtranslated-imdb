This film is an interesting reminder of how easy it is for many to be caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing. As a people of African descent, we need to change this cycle of "absolute discourse and lack of action" and begin to understand that in order to effect change, we need to talk less and act more. It is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people on small issues and our inability to recognize the bigger picture and the need to unite to make a difference ... Despite its reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message that this film seeks to portray.
