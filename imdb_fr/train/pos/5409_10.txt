I love this movie so much! The animation is great (for a pokemon movie), the CGI looks awesome. I like the music in the movie. So good, they kept the Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for history, it's great. There is a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokemon. Ash is really great in this movie and I love his friendship with Sam. The only thing I did not like was the appearance of Suicune, he comes suddenly, helps a little Ash & co and goes away. They could have done their part in the film a little bigger. <br /> <br /> But overall, awesome movie! I can not wait to get the USA version on DVD!
