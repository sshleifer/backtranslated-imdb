This film is a true masterpiece, it really is. It's rare for you to come across such a comforting movie, full of fun, laughter, sorrow and a little drama to keep you on your guard. <br /> <br /> A true family film, Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave domestic animals who have been crossing the Rockies to try to find their owners, following the changes they have undergone and the obstacles they encounter along the way. One of the truly amazing things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the dubbing is also good. Shadow is a wonderful, old, wise and brave character, and watching him try to save Sassy in the river has been a very powerful moment. Chance - who would not like a dog like Chance? He must be the most mischievous and adorable puppy ever presented on the big screen. And Sassy is very witty for a cat - she held me in her arms when she made fun of the guardian; 'Here kitty pussy kitty ... not in your life, chubby. "<br /> <br /> There were also a lot of well-prepared emotional scenes, such as Sassy flying over the waterfall (I was really scared for her), Shadow falling in the ditch (almost in tears) and the fantastic ending, when the three animals return home ... including the good old Shadow! <br /> <br /> A favorite for all times - those who do not like this movie just do not have to love animals, rent it or buy it now, and it will leave you with good memories that will last a lifetime.
