I would just say that, no matter the budget, the film must be shown all over the world at the heart of these films. We do not read much, people want to see movies. The release of this series on DVD made me want to read the whole series, and I want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. Please, do not change any of the characters either, it will spoil the effect. Because I learned to love the actors who played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now the movies are here to represent. We do not have enough. SUPER JOB !!!
