WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Hilary Duff, Marisa Tomei, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergej Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, (voice of: Montel Williams) <br /> <br /> A "risky" 21st century "STRANGELOVE" <br /> <br /> John Cusack ?? who co-wrote the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Pikser ?? Brand Hauser, exhausted but dead, decides to perform a final mission by entrusting a Middle East Oil Minister named Omar Sharif (yes, it is not Omar Sharif but you get the tone of this failure to laugh) requisitioned by the former vice president of the United States (Aykroyd, former teammate of Cusack's "Grosse Pointe Blank", making a nasty Dick Cheney miss here), engaging Brand to do what was going on under the guise of a trade show producer in mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan) for the private American company Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> During his briefing, Brand is confronted with a moment of clarity when he falls on the intrepid journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and ends up falling in love with her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of the East-European teenage sensation Yonica Babyyeah (a surprisingly honest Duff singing with her tongue for her celebrity) and the idiotic son of the country's leader. <br /> <br /> The following is a bold attempt for a twenty-first-century black comedy at the "DR. STRANGELOVE", but for all purposes and all purposes, there are unfortunately more failures than tubes in this attempt to laugh in the middle of a political message (an unjust war). outsourcing by American capitalism, check!) <br /> <br /> While Cusack riffs his Martin Blank from the aforementioned "Tip", he adds some nice touches to his man in black (he takes sauce shots Tabasco to take the rest of the cast is catching up (with the exception of Sister Joan who is a riot as an extremely tense camp aide for Hauser and who has one of the funniest laugh lines in the movie: "My mass communication skills end up paying") for the most part. <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the war in Iraq earlier this year as part of the "Grace Is Gone" at 180 degrees and it allows Here his political views are on his sleeve Although the film is admirable, its pace and rhythms do not fit in the first participation of the director Joshua Seftel here (and this is remarkable), with the exception of -being well choreographed fight that Hauser is involved with in the stupid entourage of Babyyeah's fianc√©e. <br /> <br /> A nice attempt but an unfortunate failure; maybe next time, Cusack will not try so hard and let the stupidity of the war speak for itself instead of doing most of the work on its own.
