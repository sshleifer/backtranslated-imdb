I thought this movie was LOL funny. It's fun, not to be taken seriously, a movie about a man's twisted vision about life, love and ... well, ladies "from the skank bus station to humble beginners .. skank bus station ". Tim meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps) who was raised in a Playboy style home by a paternal figure of Hugh Hefner, constantly surrounded by beautiful porn actresses and models. When his "father" puts him out, he must learn to defend himself with nothing but the chauvinistic vision of life that his youth taught him ... that and a level of unfathomable charm, almost mystical and dumb . And so begins the hijinx! If you have not seen this movie and you love a story of love and light comedy and almost insane, I highly recommend renting "The Ladies' Man".
