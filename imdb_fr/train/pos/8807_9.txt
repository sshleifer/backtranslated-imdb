It is a collection of documentaries with a duration of 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 image made by artists from around the world. Documentaries are varied and deal with all kinds of concepts. Only the theme of September 11 is shared (very minor in some cases). Some of the segments are weak while others are very strong. some are political, others not; some only concern September 11, others simply use September 11 as a theme to address human feelings, emotions and universal tragedies; some are public while others are abstract and artistic). This movie has not been censored in any way by anyone, so the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial movie, especially for conservative Americans. I think that two segments could check the right (Egypt, where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber return from the point of view of spirit morale), the other from the United Kingdom reporting the overthrow of Chile supported by the United States on September 11, 1973, which had over 50,000 dead and horrific atrocities). The segment of Mexico was the most powerful, telling the fall of the towers and the resulting death in a living way (it must be seen to believe it). <br /> <br /> Even if the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost "useless", I recommend it anyway. It is very difficult to classify this film because the segments vary from one place to another (some weak, others very powerful;). I give it a score of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments are excellent and cover issues that are generally censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
