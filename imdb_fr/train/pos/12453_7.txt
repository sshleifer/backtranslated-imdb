Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equate a low budget with a bad one. No matter what this film would need, more budget is not part of it. Large sets and many special effects would have transformed into another film by Lara Croft. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> The almost unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as an enigmatic Modesty, and it's essential for this movie to work. His wise little smiles and his scholarly airs are formidable and you find yourself wishing the camera does not leave his face. It is therefore feasible that the villain Nikolai, played by an actor as little known (in the United States at least), Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau may be interested in an unusual way to his brain, which Modesty can exploit. She is able to hijack her rape with just a push and spitting out "stop wasting my time!" then running between his heavily armed but suddenly shy handmen. Making a scene like the plausible one does not happen by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with Staden, very skinny, who plays Modesty is that it's not very credible for her to go along. with an athletic and muscular guy looking like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She's not just a Peta Wilson or a swollen actress like Hilary Swank who can give a convincing punch. Coaster-Waldau being dominated by Staden, it looks like he's just being abused with his little sister. <br /> <br /> Regarding an action movie, it's not a big mistake. I just hope they do better if and when they make up.
