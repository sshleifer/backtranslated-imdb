I really like this movie, I saw it last week after about 3 years. This film is perfect, good acting, beautiful story, superb staging / work-camera / music. It's a gift to show it to someone you love. pity that jaco van dormael did not make any more movies after this one. Top 5 works. Really !! <br /> <br /> Today is 3 years and 3 days later than the comment above. it was never posted because it did not count more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw "the eighth day" yesterday. This is definitely in my top 3 of the movie with "Cinema Paradiso" which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I'm really curious about the new movie "jaco von dormael". I hope the film will complete my top 3. If you see this movie, praise it. Or even better. Buy it. Because you will want to see him again.
