This is not a love song. <br /> <br /> My one-word summary of this movie would be "Excellent". <br /> <br /> It will probably not please the general public who is watching the mass film ?? <br /> <br /> it's a movie that requires you to participate. You observe, think and question. <br /> <br /> Comparisons could be made with Deliverance (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br /> perhaps with the Blair Witch project for a global shooting style. <Br /> <br /> However, this film is one of a kind. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic effects (solarization, still image, blur, etc.) have already been seen, but they are the most used effectively in this film <br /> <br /> to reinforce the natural tension of the story. <br /> <br /> Play is brutal, threatening and quite believable. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the film is about friendship; the title really gives <br /> <br /> the game away. This is probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or would like to live. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
