I saw this film for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival this year and, being a teenager myself, I found the film rather appealing. these children are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a film of this scale, but with the good dialogue and the garbage, they made this film a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others but I strongly recommend to publish it and watch it. it's a mix of witty commentary and hilarious reality. capturing the essence of high school, the high school record is at the top of my list of favorites and I hope to have a chance to be released in the theaters. I sincerely thank all the children who worked so hard to make this film, it helped me to cry with laughter.
