It's a good film about a person's dreams and the desire to achieve them. It's a beautiful and inspiring film. Why do some people have to try to criticize every film that comes out, especially the good ones. Dennis Quaid gives a solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher and baseball coach, who is being pushed by his team to try another professional career in baseball. With an excellent support cast, including Brian Cox, as an old Navy officer who had let so many exploits go by without his support. It was good to see him as something other than a villain in a movie. If I can only complain about this film, I'll never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to the handful of great baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural". He notes a big congratulations and a big "well done".
