Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is quite predictable, just like the dukes of Hazzard, the hunter, the team, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This show is just a good clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite amusing. They often beat each other several times per episode, which adds a lot of humor to the series. It contains several car chases in almost every episode, but who does not like a good car chase? Especially with the Coyote! <br /> <br /> I only wish that they make a clean television like this one today. I highly recommend it!
