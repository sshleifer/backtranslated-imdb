I love that movie. My friend Marcus and I were traveling around Hastings because we wanted to praise something we had never seen before and we came across this beautiful movie. We had no idea what was going to happen, but it turned out spectacular. 2 bravo. I liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny. If you're looking for a fun movie that makes you think so, I strongly suggest that you quickly go to your local video store and find this movie. I will tell you some of my favorite parts but it might ruin the movie for you, so I will not do it. This film is definitely on my list of the 10 best films. Do you really think nothing is dynamic?
