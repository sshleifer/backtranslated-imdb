Natalia's Emily Watson is absolutely the most loving and romantic main character I've ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film without a doubt. Or is it transmuted to the king? The internal weaving of chess games and the struggles of families for control, power and victory are stunning. As the chess masters do in the film, the director simultaneously plays with our mind at many simultaneous games, but all weave major or minor patterns. The period, the costumes and the images of the lacustrine district of Italy at the beginning of the 20th century are beautifully captured. Not a single square of space is lost. <br /> <br /> So many brilliant scenes abound that I can not tell them all. I recommend allowing enough time to watch this movie twice, perhaps a week apart, as it is impossible to capture all the poetry in a multi-dimensional and square frame of 64 squares. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakov's book, but to try an analogy of my own, what I'm reading makes me think of another triumphant romantic poetry film, Barry Levinson's The Natural. This totally rejected the discouraging end of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a purely American romantic impressionism. Well, the director did better by harmoniously mixing Russian and Italian morals and customs as a backdrop to enlightenment. The true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both competitors draw lots. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by these constraints and conventions of life, to the extent that we let others break our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, as personified by Emily Watson's Natalia, can transcend and allow everyone to be enriched simultaneously by her gifts. Only the barriers erected by our fears can separate us from them. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie (10/10).
