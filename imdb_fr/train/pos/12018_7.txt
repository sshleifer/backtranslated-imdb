*** SPOILERS *** Brimming with hatred and revenge, the Zach Provo half-race, James Coburn, had spent the last 11 years in a band planning his escape. What Provo wants more than freedom is to balance the accounts with the man who captured him and, during a savage shootout, killed his wife, the Navajos: former Sheriff Sam Pima County Burgade, Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Escaping after killing two prison guards, Provo heads to Yuma knowing that it's not only here that Burgade lives, but also where his young daughter Susan, Barbara Hershey lives. . Using his escaped companions to lure Burgade into the vast Arizona desert, promising them $ 30,000 in gold coins that he buried, Provo plans to take revenge on Burgade. But only after seeing him witness the brutal rape of his daughter by his condemned comrades or not be with a woman for years, horny as a rabbit during the period of love! <br /> <br /> A brutal and very effective western western updates the 1956 John Wayne classic "The Searchers" with a father looking for his kidnapped daughter in a dangerous Indian territory. Charlton Heston in the role of Sam Burgade, accused of guilt, of having killed Provo's wife and having to face the same scenario, can also happen to her daughter. Susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff. Charles Coburn, Zach Provo, vengeful half-breed, is also at his best as a convict escaped hatred and murder. <br /> <br /> The man who escaped with Provo is really not interested in his personal belongings, in that he knows the territory as his pocket, but to accompany him. It's only the thought they encounter Susan, when Provo gives them the green light, and the $ 30,000 gold coins that keep them from separating and acting as they please. <br /> <br /> Susan Hal Brickman's friend, Chris Mitchum, accompanies Burgade and proves he's as good as Burgade. He felt that he did not have it in him, both to track down the escaped criminals and to have used common sense, which is missing in Burgade in this case. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS **** The incredibly brutal and bloody confrontation between Burgade and Provo is almost too difficult to hold. Provo, who hates Burgada, has come close to the righteous madness and wanted him to suffer a slow and agonizing death. It is this hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and which, after taking half a dozen bullets, ended up putting the madman and blood thirsty, as well as the stupid, the fool for good!
