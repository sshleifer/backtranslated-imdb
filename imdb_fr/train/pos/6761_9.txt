Otto Preminger's cycle of black films by Dana Andrews is one of the largely unknown gems of the genre. Because they lack paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they seemed perhaps displaced at the time, but the clear images, the complex game with the identity, the masculinity and the representation, the subversion of the psychological principles Traditional, the austere and geometric style looks surprisingly modern today, and very similar to Melville. The lucid ironies of this film are so loaded, brutal and ironic that the happy end is one of the cruelest in Hollywood history. Brilliant at the level of the entertaining thriller too, tense and stuffed with double-edged dialogues.
