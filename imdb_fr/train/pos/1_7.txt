If you like adult cartoons, like South Park, it's an almost similar format about the little adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explosive candies and behaved like dogs, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also little stories with the teachers of the school. There is the main idiot, Mr. Bip, the professor of nervous mathematics and many others. The cast is also fantastic, Gina Yashere by Lenny Henry, Chrissie Watts by EastEnders, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Doon Mackichan by Smack The Pony, Mark Perry by Dead Ringers and Nina Conti by Blunder. I did not know it was from Canada, but that's fine. Very well!
