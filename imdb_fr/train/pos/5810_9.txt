Mr. Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short films, that is, his music videos, are simply the best. I do not care about receiving a science-fiction feature film from this man, but I want to get a mix of his crazy dances, howling screams, cool choreography, and some computer-generated images. 'animation. There should also be some uninterrupted videos. All I mentioned is here. A stupid plot and an excessive "vanity fair" are not a problem when I witness the action of Mr. Michael Jackson. For me, he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not "the king of pop", which sounds ridiculous, especially for us, Russians, because "pop" sounds like the Russian word for "donkeys" and that MJ is definitely not "the king of music" donkeys. ") I can re-watch his best music videos (of artistic beauty) and I never tire of it. <br /> <br /> My first impression of this movie was "What is it ...?" (Excerpts of different videos, drawn pictures, disturbing jumps from one theme to another, the absence of consistent plot, kids having fun, etc.) but I watched until the end, I could say it was awesome and really nothing like anything else on TV nowadays What I like here too is that it never shows shameful content and can be watched easily by children. <br /> <br /> Without Mr Michael Jackson, the world of video clips would be rather p Even the best classical videos of other artists can not get close to the energy hyperbole of musical madness and the artistic quality of MJ. He knew how to attract audiences of different ages and remain a man with moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I see a good DVD coming out with Mr. Michael Jackson's videos, I know he deserves to be bought. even if some clips have already appeared in another previous version. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are all excellent, although only "Moonwalker" looks more like a movie (with a solid "Smooth Criminal" theme, a "paparazzi" topic and some weird quirks). <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of MJ, I can still give this "movie ... not like the others" a solid 9 out of 10 (I was hit by "Smooth Criminal" and the The main complaints are: the initial segments of the film could have been abandoned while the main "anti-drug campaign" had received more "astronomical madness and stress" and there should have been more "moonwalk" it -even ). Thank you for your attention.
