This film is one of the most risky black and white films of this era in the early 1930s, before the application of the Hoyts Code. This is the story of a beautiful young woman who settles in New York and rises to the top of the hierarchy using her body as a way to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers who does a pretty good job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and goes into the business world sleeping with all men. Stanwyck makes a remarkable performance as a strong woman who uses men as unique contracts, feeling no emotion about them, playing them as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who has no love in mind, but power and money. <br /> <br /> I found this film a bit different from the one I saw because there is hardly any background music. heard. I think it's only because that's when people were introduced to sound and dialogue between film actors. The rare times when music is heard is at the beginning, we are shown how it progresses in the chain. The shooting and the different scenes were fantastic! The director of this film made the right angles and the good turns by realizing this film full of realism. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was a good movie. The end of this movie was not so good. as it should have been, but it did not completely ruin it. Throughout the film, Baby Face has had scenes of slow movements, and perhaps some predictable parts, like the one she is going to sleep with. But it's an adorable movie that can be watched more than once, and suggested to some people and friends.
