At the end of the first hour, my jaw was comfortably nestled between my feet. The film never lets go, and I mean never, lets the action go. It may be a light action, but it's action. Once again, all cast members fit in perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the pursuit scenes were feasible and the fights were incredible. Matt Damon will be Jason Bourne forever. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and that's no exception. The action, the stakes, the plot. How they do it, I'll never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screen games to each of these films. Because if he had not done such a good job with the first movie, we would not have that one to talk about. <br /> <br /> Then do not see him in the theaters, go see him in cinemas if it's still where you live, but otherwise December 11, Bourne comes home!
