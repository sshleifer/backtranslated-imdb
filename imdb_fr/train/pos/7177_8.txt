This insightful documentary really amused me and I waited a long time before it all went through the pipes (my local video channel), and it was worth the wait. I like a good documentary / topic of special interest, but it was really a heart, honest and nostalgic, if you will, think back to teenage life. The imagination of a child is fascinating and that's where a beautiful story begins. Rent it or buy it if you like a good fun and humorous documentary. Mr. Stein and his company have certainly come a long way since the local productions of video camcorders of bank robbers and gay rings that make homosexual people at a glance. They all seem rather prosperous in their respectful fields, and it was good to know that they are still good friends. The DVD contains a few additional trailers for other great documentaries, as well as a number of Darren's most notable productions, including Crazy News.
