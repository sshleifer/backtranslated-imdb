I must say that this is the first quality of romantic comedy I have ever seen. there was depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to meet, there was still nostalgia and anticipation. the thought that maybe they will not meet ... it's an independent film after all. this film was well written, directed and played. the dance on the side of the road was beautiful.
