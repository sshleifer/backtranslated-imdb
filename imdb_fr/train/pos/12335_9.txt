Warning: contains a spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but others, including Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are extremely woody. Ney is lying in bed, dying of poisoning with arsenic, each hair in place. Yet the film is so juicy and so suspensive. More faithful to the book than most movies of his time. Making Joan Fontaine a poisoner (and adultery, which was just as shocking at the time - I'm not kidding, children) was a master stroke. She's just her usual Joan Fontainey. As the murderers were supposed to do it, she died by falling "the most important feet in the ground, in an empty space".
