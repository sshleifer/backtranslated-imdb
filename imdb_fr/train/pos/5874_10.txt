this move was friggin hilarious !!! Funniest I've seen for a while, Akshay and John kick ass as always, and the girls are hot too. The story is great, there are many good jokes and the one who read this before me is an idiot. For him, I say that you are not of Indian origin, so you would not understand the humor. do not write down movies you do not understand. what did you watch, the subtitled version where the majority of the jokes are lost in translation? That's what I thought Jackass. <br /> <br /> akshay kumar is the best actor of all time and proves once again his versatility. He knows how to play action, but also comedy. He is excellent in this field. John has also proven himself: this is his first role in comedy and he has also excelled in this field.
