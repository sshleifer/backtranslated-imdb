Nora is a single mother of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, just like her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The philosophy of "free love" is not quite out of the system? and Nora did not expect to fall in love, especially with a junkie. Hazlehurst won the first of two AFI Awards in four years for her astonishing rendition of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing for her kids, but falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner ?? who would then costar in movies such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET ?? is well represented as pre-pubescent girl of Nora and Caton (perhaps ready to assume her role of animator of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000 ???) appears as a beard painter. The first efforts of the director Cameron are winners. he then directed the award-winning mini-series MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it's Hazlehurst's superb performance that brings to life an intelligent and inspired script inspired by Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
