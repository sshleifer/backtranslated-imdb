This film is not for everyone. You are either bright enough to get it, or you are not. Fans of sci-fi movies that do not take themselves too seriously will appreciate this movie. I recommend this film to those who can enjoy parodies and parodies. Everyone I recommended this movie liked it. If you like Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, this one will certainly please you. The vocal characterizations are done with a tongue-in-cheek and the monolines fly fast and furiously.
