A comforting film. The beautiful comedy usual John Thaw, recently deceased. A man who was always so modest. He was certainly one of the 10 best English actors of my time. <br /> <br /> He will be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. Like Jack Regan in the 1970s, he was featured in the television series Sweeney and as a lawyer in Kavanah, Quebec. A must for the whole family and an excellent DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back memories to those who remember Great Britain during the war and certainly to those who were evacuated from London to escape the German bombing. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and the boy William was really well played and faithful to Michelle Magorian's book.
