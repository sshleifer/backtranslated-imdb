This is actually a trilogy of 3 stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is The Verger, which lasts about 15 minutes and is very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is fired from church work because he can not read or write. So, what is he doing? Open a tobacco, of course! <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. All Know, which was actually a story I read for school 6 years ago and that I instantly forgot, until I 'hear the familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes, and also very good. It worked better for a movie than for a book, but maybe it was because I was only 14, the last time. <br /> <br /> The third is almost a disappointment. Almost an hour in length, he simply hangs out. It's not so bad, but not as fast and fast as the last two. thing! <br /> <br /> Overall, I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
