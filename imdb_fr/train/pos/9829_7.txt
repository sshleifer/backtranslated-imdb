This movie is awesome at so many levels ... and none of them is the level it was meant to be great on. <br /> <br /> Remember this: When you watch Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... whether good or bad ... THIS is the formula they use. That's the quality of zombie movies. <br /> <br /> And the story behind the film is better than the quality. A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> Overall, this does not linger. There is never a moment when you say to yourself: "go ahead, move on" ... it moves quickly and it turns out well. Here is the small number of sports zombies Italian. <br /> <br /> So horrible, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends a lot of time on your cheek ... praise it, buy it, adore it. <br /> <br /> General note: if you watch it on DVD, you will notice that there are sound effects in the menu screen, under the musical score ... Well ... it's is because the music was raised directly from the trailer ... which is probably the only working copy of this music that still exists, namely long enough to make a loop.
