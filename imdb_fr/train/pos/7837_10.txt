After listening to the music of the CD several times, I knew that I wanted this film, that I had it for Christmas and that I was amazed. Marc Bolan had such a charisma, I can not describe it. I had heard of him that way, but I did not understand what people were talking about before I was in the company of these images. He was amazing. Excerpts from Wembley's concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches, such as nuns gorging themselves on a garden party while Marc Bolan plays Acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I still learn the titles of the songs). George Claydon, the little photographer of the Magical Mystery Tour, plays the role of a driver who jumps from a car and eats one of the mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe this would spoil everything, even if I put the disclaimer on the spoilers in this notice, so you would just need to see it yourself. He avoids the description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and I was curious to see Ringo directing a rock documentary - it was 35 years ago - now I discover that he is on DVD for 2 years but that's finally home. It's an amazing visual experience - even exciting. <br /> <br /> The DVD is now delivered with hidden extras.
