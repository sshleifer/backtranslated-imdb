I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with LA Weekly reviews and decided to get a ticket for this movie. the film features molly parker (from my favorite TV show, Deadwood) and Lukas haas - which I suspect we will see more in the very near future. The film is funny, comforting, presents an excellent acting and beautiful photographs. I do not know if the film is distributed, but I hope it will be - or will be - soon. it is destined to be a real independent jewel. he even has music from my favorite band the Silver Jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker was not there during the screening. Even without it, it was the best film I saw at the festival.
