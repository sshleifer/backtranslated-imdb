Cheech and Chong live stories of drugs, singing, drugs, driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, strangers, petrol, linens, comedy comedies, especially drugs and SPACE COKE !!. It's not as coherent and plausible as Up in Smoke but it's still incredibly funny, without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are classic scenes, including the opening scene, where they receive petrol for their car and their commute to work. The Cheech song (Mexican-American) and the Chong follow-up song are also fun. Another notable scene is the well-being office with Jones (Human noise machine), the Police Academy series, and the laughing old man. All in all, it's a good follow up of Up in Smoke and is quite visible to watch when it's sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
