New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven shorts, each segment lasts about 10 minutes. Shorts do not relate exactly, but they all have something in common, love. Each short film aims to find love, whether it's a couple or two strangers chatting. The film stars a set, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan. Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Christie Julie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such a brilliant cast and such an interesting concept, I was expecting a great movie. the problem is that New York, I love you does not count. It remains the sum of its parts. Some segments are fun, original and interesting, but others are so insignificant (segments Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q) that it's appalling. The film is really uneven and has a very experimental tone. In terms of history, it seems that some film students could gather their knowledge. That said, the film also has great moments, one of the best being the segment devoted to an old couple played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman on their 67th wedding anniversary in Brooklyn. And it's moments like this that made me a spectator and I wanted the film to be more coherent, because there is a lot of potential here. But, as unsatisfactory as the whole story ends up being, for me, the cinematography and the soundtrack have saved everything. The editing was perfect, the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack could not be more suitable. In the end, New York I Love You looks like an experimental film and, as in most experiments, there are ups and downs. It's the way we look at the film as a whole that will determine whether he likes it or not. It could be worth it for some and a waste of time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
