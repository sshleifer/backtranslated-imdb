This film deserves a 10 for its brilliant representation of the world lived in the spirit of a playboy. While I found this world morally repugnant, the film did better what the narrative has to do, that is to say we live an experience we would never have experienced otherwise. Tim Meadows portrays Leon Phelps so convincingly, and the story plunged me into Leon's reckless world that I forgot for a moment that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt obliged to rebel. This is where the film breaks down because its great and daring success story is at the price of its own success. Understanding that the vast majority of moviegoers will react only to the story of this film and that she rejects this story, I hesitate to make a mistake and admit that I loved it. I loved him not only for his fascinating ideas about the playboy's troubled spirit, not only for his amusing portrayal of the idiocy of the sexual drive, but also for his courage to explore without fear what is in the world. shadow of heterosexuality. Besides, it's just funny.
