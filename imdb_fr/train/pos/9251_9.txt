What can I say ?, Mrs. Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl, and as an Italian American, first fan of female beauty, I can not forget this movie. <br /> <br /> you know I really do not do it. Do not remember much about intrigue, situations or other actors. I only remember the super-beautiful Erika and that in this film it looks better than ever, I do not care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I do not care only the beautiful moments where I I was a teenager in Brooklyn I'm just contemplating the beauty of Erika. <br /> <br /> Well, to conclude, if you're a fan of the beauty of Erika Eleniak like me, this movie is for you.
