I rented this movie at Netflix for two reasons: I was in the mood for what I thought was a sci-fi idiot of the '50s and because it's Superman's first feature film. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes, I found myself completely engaged and very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> An experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is closing its doors. Lois and Clark show up for the scoop, but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled is no longer in operation. A day later, strange events at the well make a story more appropriate for Superman than Clark Kent. It appears that the radioactive Mole Men have invaded their six-mile deep home near the center of the Earth. <br /> <br /> Supermen and the Mole Men is a piece of simplistic but well-made social realism. Published in 1951, featuring a leading actor who served during the Second World War, the moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anyone. Reeves even accuses the band of lynches who chase the Mole Men to be "Nazis" at some point. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s, the science behind this film was: nonexistent. Six miles of drilling in the continental crust would not have even entered the upper mantle, let alone the "hollow center of the earth" - which, in any case, does not exist. Unforgettable - remember that this movie is based on a cartoon of the golden age. <br /> <br /> The film is a little irregularly rhythmic. Although the Molemen are interesting, a little scary and beautifully portrayed, there are several scenes that look like Cormans and spend too much time redundantly showing us their strange behavior. The script is smart and economical. According to the current standards, the costumes are mediocre, but for his time, the special effects and the costumes of this film were rather good. Cinematography is also generally very good and the acting is much better than you would expect. I was particularly impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
