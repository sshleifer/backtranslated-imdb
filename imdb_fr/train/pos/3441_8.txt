This film is incredibly realistic and I think it's very fair to do justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience. The many people who think they can understand what is happening in a victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I think Dawson did a fantastic job in his role as Maya. I agree it's an incredibly brave film. This presents the rape from a different angle, more realistic than any other film I've seen on the subject. The end has been long, but I know that many victims imagine this type of justice, because the chances of an attacker being sent to prison for his crime are about 1%. It's good to see a movie that is closer to reality than most people would dare.
