The film begins with Vincent Price about to begin his performance as a magician. However, halfway through the very successful show, the police came and closed it. It seems that his former boss had cheated on him tips that Price had created - even those he had created at home. As a result, Price rightly kills the bad guy. The problem is, if the viewer understood why Price was killed and probably thought it was a good thing, because Price was a bit crazy, he just could not stop there (kind of like eating potato chips Lay). <br /> <br /> The movie was full of creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and a crematorium for shows), great twists and thrilling action scenes. One thing you can not say about this movie is that it is dull. Although far from subtle, it is fun and worth the detour. <br /> <br /> If I had never seen Vincent Price's version of HOUSE OF WAX, I probably would have liked THE MAD MAGICIAN. and it scored an 8 or 9. That's because although THE MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful movie, it is a strong reminder of the movie that preceded it (HOUSE OF WAX). In the end, since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula was repeated in the follow-up movie. Both were made in 3D, both have a plot where Price has every reason to kill but he can not stop once he has committed the first and both are very fun to watch. The biggest differences, and there are few, are that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and more like a horror movie and THE MAD MAGICIAN was certainly more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this movie AND HOUSE OF WAX (only in the Price version). They are both great horror movies of the 1950s.
