This movie was one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen. great for the whole family to watch. the ideas may be a bit far-fetched, but it's a good comedy and the acting is great. love the little boy, j.p. Academy Award winner Adrien Brody may have been very short, but very memorable. highly recommended.
