A long time ago, I watched this middle movie on the cable. I then had a crush on Mary Moronov. I saw her again in Eating Raoul. I was convinced she was the sexiest woman on the screen. <br /> <br /> I may have a bias for this movie. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I have on the soundtrack.
