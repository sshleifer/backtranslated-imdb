One of the best drama movies I have ever seen. We do a lot of things in the church and it is a resource that can be used as a resource that showcases all the good things that the actors can do in their work. I highly recommend this one, especially for those who have an interest in acting, as a "must see". There are several note scenes. First, the scene of the cemetery where Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows this scene by going to elementary school) and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was great - I guess it's a Shakespeare testament more than anything else. For a second, I really enjoyed the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams discussed the upcoming duel.
