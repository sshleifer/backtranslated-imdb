As long-haired young men who are extremely interested in this Graf's silent speeches know, in the summer aristocrats like to go to exclusive and distinguished places to avoid the heat and hordes of rudimentary people taking their comfort. . Such strange journeys around the world also take place in "Three Ages", a charming and elegant work performed by old hands, namely Mr. Buster Keaton and Mr. Eddie Cline. <br /> <br /> Of course, this German Earl liked the first segment more about the Stone Age because of the affinity that this aristocrat feels with this ancient era. preferring this one to the second segment that takes place during the glory of Rome (he should have included the cause of the fall of the Roman empire, that is to say barbarians, or the same thing, of the Germans).
