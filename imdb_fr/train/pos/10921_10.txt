After reading tons of good reviews on this movie, I decided to take it for a spin (I bought it on DVD, hence the pun on "spin" ... I'm a dork). The beginning was all I hoped for, a perfect editing (with some quotes I heard on several Wu-Tang albums) for what should have been a good movie. But the plot I heard was so great, so predictable. Whenever I saw a character (except the lizard), I guessed what venom he was. In addition, the only cool character is killed in the middle of the film. Ok, so the plot was not very good but at least there was good kung-fu no? False. The fighting was very short and rare. Admittedly, the different styles were all pretty cool, but I wish the fights are longer. I was hoping to see the lizard run and splurge on the walls but that never happened. I was hoping to see the centipede make some fast but that never happened. I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 minutes in total, but it never happened. In short, not much is happening. The fights are all a nice routine. Do not be fooled, because this film has a plot, it does not mean that it is good.
