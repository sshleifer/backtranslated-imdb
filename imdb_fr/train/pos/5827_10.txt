This film of three accomplices is on par with my other favorite movie, "Disorder in the Court". It's a tumult of laughter for any fan of the Trois Stooges. <br /> <br /> The boys are concierges in a recording studio when they hear the lovely Christine McIntyre sing a superb version of "Voices of Spring". She will be offered a registration contract, but she must be honest with her father about her career choice and prove herself as a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the guys decide to have a little fun, play her record and dress Curly in Christine. The contract worker who can make the career of Christine sees Curly, takes it for him and invites him to sing for his evening. Of course, there's a man they've upset who's at the party and they're destroying his solo in front of the crowd, so he'll find a way to get revenge on them. <br /> <br /> What a great Flo Flo, this should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
