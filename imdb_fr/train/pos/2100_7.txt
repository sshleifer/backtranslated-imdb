Before going into politics or the public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best British film actresses. This film shows his talent despite his role in a brilliant cast including Julie Christie as Kitty, wife of a British royal captain who has lost the memory of his last 20 years, and Jenny played by the American Ann-Margret in almost unrecognizable role as adorable sister. Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from a memory loss caused by the shock of the shell during the First World War. Sir Ian Holm plays a lesser role as a doctor who treats him. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not help but watch Glenda play a frumpy housewife and the first true love of the captain, but they come from different classes. It's not the best movie, but it's nice to see Glenda's incredible talent. She is always a fantastic actress, a comedy or a drama. She makes Margaret Gray a nice person and you see why a royal captain fell in love with her.
