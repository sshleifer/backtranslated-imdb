I do not know how or why this movie has a low rating on IMDb. This film, accompanied by "I am Curious: Blue", is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will let you down in this film is that if you do not like the film process, do not like psychology or expect to be caught pornographic deprived. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you will want to watch to relax; It's a film you'd like to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. SUMMARY ******, MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO **************************************************************************** film, but it does so that sometimes you forget that the fictions are not real. <br /> <br /> The film is like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary about the Swedish social system of the time. Which, in many ways, is still relevant today. Interviews conducted by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A film about a filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, who makes a film ... deals with the relationship with his star in the film and the fact that he should never have been involved with people with whom he was supposed to work. <br /> <br /> 3 The film made by Vilgot. This is a young woman named Lena (IE No. 2), young and very active politically, she makes a documentary (IE No. 1). She is also an adult and her sexuality and freedom. <br /> <br /> The splendor and brilliance of "I am curious: yellow / blue" are the perfect combination of these three elements. At one point, you watch an interview about politics and for a moment you look at what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but you do it so well that you sometimes forget that it's the story. <br /> <br /> the dynamic between "yellow" and "blue", which if you see one, you have to see each other. "Blue" is not a sequel at all. I will try to explain it as best I can because, to my knowledge, no other film has done, although it is a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "Yellow" as a living thing, the current events of 14 scenes. A complete story. <br /> <br /> Think of "blue" as everything between the 14 "yellow" scenes you have not seen, it's a complete story. <br /> <br /> These are essentially parallel movies ... the same story, told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was only when I saw the first 30 minutes of "Blue" that I understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope it has been useful for people who are discouraged by various influences, because this film has changed my way of seeing the film. <br /> <br /> thank you for your time.
