This film captures the essence of growing up in a small American town for a lonely girl. The realism and subtle nuances offered to Ashley Judd's character Ruby reflect what can only be described as a realistic setting in Florida's panhandle. From the slam of a mosquito net door to lack of work, the echoes of what life on the "red-necked riviera" is a difficult choice for the girl. Heaven did not come easily. But she slowly overcomes obstacles and deception and learns to be his own wife, with a force flowing from within. Ashley Judd's winning smile and contagious gait exude warmth and respect and admiration. The delicate pace of character development resembles that of "Ulee's Gold" from 1997, performed by Peter Fonda and also directed by Victor Nunez.
