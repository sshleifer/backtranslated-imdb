Originally, I watched 8 simple rules on the Disney Channel in the UK for the first series and became completely addicted. When they did not show it anymore, it was annoyed, but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series. I did not think another series would start after John Ritter's reading, but the 2nd series was not surprising. The last series has returned to its excellent standard. I hope they will soon produce more shows, even though I could watch each show a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character as Airhead Bridget and also achieves an incredible performance in Charmed. Rory is also good, he shares my name and Grampa too. I will continue to watch until it ends until that moment, I hope it will continue as funny as ever
