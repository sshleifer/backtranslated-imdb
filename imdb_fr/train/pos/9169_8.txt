I really liked Timothy Dalton, although he was a little young and too good for MR, but I thought Zelah Clarke was too big and short. This version was however very faithful to the novel and very well filmed. I saw 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite, MR, although George C Scott did very well. It's a clash between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although they are both a little too old for the role. I recently saw a brilliant television version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I'd love to see those two Jane Eyre.By the time I watched the version of Ciarin Hinds, I think I was Jane Eyred out, but I'll never get tired of those first few minutes of hearing the voice from Joan Fontaine tell the opening of the first version I have ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
