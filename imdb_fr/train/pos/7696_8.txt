When "Good Times" was created in 1974, it was one of the first sitcoms of the black family. It was centered on the Evans family, a Chicago-based poor family struggling to make ends meet. Most of the first episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to support the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and had excellent chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma and Michael. J.J. was the brave but well-meaning teenage son who compensated for his lack of subtlety by his artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive and brilliant girl who constantly exchanged insults with J.J. Michael was a child prodigy, well educated on social issues and destined to become a lawyer. <br /> <br /> In 1976, the producers made a big mistake in firing John Amos, literally killing his character. It really changed the focus, not the good that I could add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his joking behavior that angered black viewers as well as the star of the series Esther Rolle, who left after the following season. Instead of a show focused on the major African-American issues of society at the time, viewers had overloaded shows of skirts and big jokes. <br /> <br /> Once Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Although it was still visible, it was no longer the great revolutionary spectacle it had once been. <br /> <br /> Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became clear that the show was in its final stage. All the details were scrambled during this season and the show slowly faded. <br /> <br /> First three seasons: A. Last three seasons: C +.
