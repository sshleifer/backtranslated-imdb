I waited a moment before publishing a review of this documentary because when I saw it for the first time more than 10 years ago, I wanted to think about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> According to a documentary, I found it to be a good documentary. He did what he planned to do, showed me something I had no idea of ​​and kept me interested in the world he explored. I did not know anything about Drag's world and I did not find anything about it. The "Balls" were just spectacular for me. These people were so talented for what they do and how they do it for the competition. The catty people, the plaintiffs (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat that Drag Queen wore was not a man's coat!), The jealous ones, everything is there as in all other competitions. LIKE ANY OTHER COMPETITION. Which seemed to me an argument. <br /> <br /> The former drag-queen explained how the balls "were" compared to the most recent drag-queens who changed the balls and created more categories of competition - and even those who wanted to know that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk on the track. It was interesting to hear that some of the competitors lived in the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete, it was also important for them! Then, there were sad stories, stories of "home" and "mother of house" brought out the best and the brightest of the competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now, after 10 years of watching this movie, I experienced the so-called madness "Madonna". I spotted some familiar faces of this documentary that met up with Madonna during her "Vogue" phase and rightly so. Without these people, Madonna would not have had a "Vogue" phase, I know it now. The credit must be granted when the credit is due. I wonder if everyone in America is watching this documentary, he will learn that he is not as "mainstream" as he thinks.
