"Casomai" is a masterly tale describing the story of a young couple wading in the murky waters of marriage. The story is very believable by telling the strange swing between oblivion and the continued interference of others, which is quite typical in Italy (one wonders if such events are different elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing and this is one of the highlights of the film. Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo are sober and catchy. And the figure of the compassionate priest is funny and well rounded. In the end, a truly deserving film, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
