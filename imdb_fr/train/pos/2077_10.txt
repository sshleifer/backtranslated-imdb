This timeless proverb resonates in this film and in my heart. So many years I was waiting to see this eternal story! I may not be ready. It is possible that my sensitivity would not have appreciated his power. I greet her with joy in my soul. <br /> <br /> My respect and my admiration for PAUL MUNI lasted a long time. It is now a legendary luminescence. But now, I have finally discovered the precious gifts of the splendid talents of LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can speak like hers? Some said it had been done by his years of silence, and it might have been, but his speech is quite eloquent when given a chance. She deserved her Oscar. <br /> <br /> This film is in an epic in the most classical proportions. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. The peasants can leave if they wish, but they will flee a story that will remain a lifetime. <br /> <br /> GOOD EARTH enriches the beings in an unexpected way. But everything will not come with the joy I made. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not push me with simple technical details about the race of the main actors. These are expectations of modern times where we are obsessed with absolute perfection. But I dare twenty million recent movies tell the story of PEARL BUCK with so much strength, power, conviction and grace. <br /> <br /> If a modern artist dares to re-film this masterpiece, I warn him will never be close to the aromatic fragrance that always emanates from the heart of this story. Time will not diminish this effort, nor will progress improve.
