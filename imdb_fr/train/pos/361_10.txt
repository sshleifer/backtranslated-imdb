As I said above, four stars are not enough. It's one of the best movies I've seen in almost 17 years. For people who do not like it or do not really understand it, you should not have a real appreciation of the art, otherwise you may have a short attention span. Even though I have not seen all his movies yet, I must say that it is Spielberg at its peak. It's pretty sad to see that movies as great as "The Color Purple" do not come too often because I think we all desperately need first rate movie entertainment in these tough times. <br /> Movies like this are more than just movies; They are works of art that deserve to be better appreciated. <br /> <br /> The idea that she was nominated for 11 Oscars (and even the best picture of the year) without receiving a trophy is a sign of how Hollywood can be blind and stupid sometimes . Spielberg has not even been nominated for the best director! He should have swept the Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows how unfair the lives of some people are. <br /> <br /> If only movies were always so good ....
