"Capitães de Abril" is a very good one. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But that gives us an idea of ​​the situation. The fiction of the story is not of great interest, but it does not spoil the film. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are not exaggerated and the film is also a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25 revolution. <br /> <br /> All actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. Lisbon is beautiful as always. Do not miss it! I really enjoyed this film.
