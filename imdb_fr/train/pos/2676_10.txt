Every day we can watch a lot of movies, soap operas ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle occurs. A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director-director. For me, there are two films that everyone needs to see: the first is the Pacula? "Sophie's choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we must learn more about humility, the love of others, the acceptance of the other civilization, of another way of life. We must also fight against racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; it's enough to love our mate. This wonderful film helps us reach his dream for John (Lennon): imagine all the people living in peace. These two films are hard to see: look at them, but you will be hurt, but better. Great film, good actors, dreadful story, guarantee against pain and pain, but also better understanding of others. Enjoy it.
