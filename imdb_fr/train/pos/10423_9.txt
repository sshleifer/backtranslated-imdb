Yes, be my love was Mario Lanza's flare and is still popular today. His voice was loud and steady, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that constant practice and vocal lessons have become Caruso's visionary in Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza has done a remarkable job in history, but the story is not quite true. blame Hollywood! I used to sing his songs years ago and I became very good at losing my voice because of emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Achieving the high note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
