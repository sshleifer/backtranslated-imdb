Overall, I totally agree with Ebert's opinion. In a way, I think I should not even comment because it's so much a veterinary film and I'm not a veterinarian (I was a resistance fighter). The default is that Martha is very underdeveloped and does not act consistently. In my opinion, Stephen Metcalfe is himself a veterinarian and has spent too little time planning his character.
