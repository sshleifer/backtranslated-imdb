Antwone Fisher's story of childhood neglect and abuse is a source of inspiration for all of us who have witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children. Abandoned by a troubled mother, Antwone never met her father. Growing up with "religious" abusers who use the "n-word" not only to intimidate and hurt, but also to express their affection, as a young man testifying how his best friend is killed in a racial clash and being teased while serving in the Navy, Antwone's anger slowly turns into positive power when a Navy Psychiatrist gives her advice, and a love enters her life. <br /> <br /> The scene where Antwone meets her biological mother is one of the most powerful moments of the film. Stunned by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell him how he lived a life without crime, his addiction to drugs, the fact of having children left and right, all in spite of extremely adverse circumstances. <br /> <br /> If this scene was not powerful enough, the next scene brings her home (and opens the flood gates): A reception to welcome Antwone; Dozens of smiling faces with open arms announcing that SE was part of this big family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages conveyed by this beautiful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and children. unwanted children. Even though some of the homes and administrators do not seem to care and seem selfish, many give it all. The character who found Antwone's "record" once he revealed the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD includes a track in French, various choices of subtitles. as well as additional features and information about foster families. <br /> <br /> As Clevelander, I enjoyed the pictures of place. No matter where you come from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem.
