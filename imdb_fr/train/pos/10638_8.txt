When I think of this film, all the adjectives that come to mind are in some way related to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, I think this film should be judged in terms of. Watch the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine sleeping by the fire or the steamy turkish bath and let her invade your senses of impressions of spices, thick fabrics, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames , satin crinkles. Do not just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the deafening voice of the storyteller hypnotize you.
