I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the eldest, announced that he was HIV-positive, the reactions of the family members were touching and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a family as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout at it. I did not understand why the family thought that the youngest could not handle the news, but once past this difficult task, I found the film shocking. <br /> <br />
