The actors play beautifully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams has the comic role of Osiric, otherwise it might be a little strange to see him in such a production. It's really good that Kenneth decided to use the most complete version of the text, it certainly does not happen too often ... Thanks to this, viewers can see everything, not the pieces chosen by the director. Also - thank you to God that the film is in a classical form; NO to the surreal fanfaberies! Although "Tytus Andronicus" is still impressive, Hamlet remains a different story, at least that's my point of view.
