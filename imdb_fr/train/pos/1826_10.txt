I loved this movie when I was little. Today, at 17, it's one of my favorite animated films. A beautiful animation and attractive characters are just two of the things that appeal to this movie. Although many people may not like certain songs, most of them are well done and go hand in hand with the story. He focuses on Charlie, a handsome German Shepard who may seem inconceivable to some at first ... but who will eventually conquer you. <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie. Often very dark and sometimes scary. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation fans. But keep a handkerchief handy. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to the cinema. Without a doubt one of the greatest non-Disney animated movies of all time. With Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> LOWER RESULT: A heavenly masterpiece.
