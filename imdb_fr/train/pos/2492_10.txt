it's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. it's really refreshing to watch and I was in the stitches a few times. I suppose there is also a factor of social consciousness that makes it very interesting. if they were white girls, would they have the same reaction? maybe they would, maybe the characters do not know any limits (check my words) and do not exclude anyone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorites is the bob the builder. it's so stupid it's genius. if you like twisted black comedy, it's for you. No Blonde's is another hilarious comedy from the British BBC aired on TV! It's such a funny show and the raging characters on the unsuspecting audience are laughing hard! It would be impossible to keep your face straight by watching crazy characters and public reactions! This series easily adds to the great comedies produced!
