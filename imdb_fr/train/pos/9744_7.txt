"Yes, Georgio" is a pleasant and light film / comedy that contains beautiful scenery and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I've enjoyed seeing more than once. Some critics have suggested that if one wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, they would probably be better served by an opera DVD. Although a complete opera may be a better representation of Pavarotti's operatic talents, an opera often requires costumes and stories that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his voice and to display his personality and character in the same way as an opera. <br /> <br /> Many critics seemed to find the story incredible; I do not agree Extremely talented people can be both egocentric and charming - enough charm to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from each other often develop a sense of self and develop positively by interacting with people who stretch or lead them in directions that they may not have chosen. -Same. Georgio and Pamela open more to unexplored parts of themselves in relation to each other. <br /> <br /> Relax and indulge in visually and audibly enriching film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The final scenes of Puccini's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there.
