Once again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a tour of the wild side. And what is remarkable, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Hi-society Mumbai - stars and starlets, glam dolls and witch doctors, business magnates and types of brokers, yep the stinky lot - are in net focus here. As in a typical tabloid, their worlds unfold, each colorful story constituting an intelligent sub-plot in itself. <br /> <br /> A troubled starlette dropped by the producer after her pregnancy, her hostess and her well-known husband, the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, the journalists and the police captain; all the shades on the screen and countless hues in between. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar does an awesome job in picking up the land on the drama kings, the dancing queens and the undead. Atul Kulkarni does well, as do Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as a journalist specialized in the former crime, but she could have been modeled a little in adequacy with the job change and the party circuit. <br /> <br /> Very concentrated (average duration 140 minutes) and different refreshing film, well worth the money.
