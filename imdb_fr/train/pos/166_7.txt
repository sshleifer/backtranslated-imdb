It was the first film that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable did together and they shot several more. Crawford features a rich girl whose father is decimated by the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and their brother, William Bakewell, finds a job with Gable, a gangster. Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job, but quickly gets over his head. Crawford becomes a journalist in a newspaper, but wants to work on the big stories but receives worthless tricks. Their is a massacre in which several men of Gable are killed and Crawford has witnessed the thing. It's a good movie but not one of the best.
