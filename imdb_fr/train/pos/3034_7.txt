An underestimated addition to Graham Greene's cinematographic canon - his perceived flaws can now be considered virtues. Director Shumlin, a theater director, frames his action with oppressive rigidity adapted to the material, and the seemingly inane compositions convincingly suggest discomfort. At once black thriller and history of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a thriller of the 40s!), The film has an honest hero who becomes crazy and murderer (and maybe pedophile), brilliantly brings distant ideologies of the Spanish Civil War in a dangerous reality, there is a dreadful murder, an astonishing discovery of class and capitalism, intelligent theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of the god of Greene and an end that is only happy if you do not know nothing about history.
