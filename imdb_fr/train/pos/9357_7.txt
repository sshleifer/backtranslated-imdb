In New York, dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance in the street. Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters on September 11 as Alan struggled to discuss his deepest feelings with his wife. Alan renounces his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life by sending him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie reacts aggressively to the treatment and is sent back to court. <br /> <br /> "Reign Over Me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11th is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the magnificent Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is impossible to recognize, I do not know if she wears her makeup excessively to look older, but her face is strange. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Queen Sober Mim" ("The reign over me")
