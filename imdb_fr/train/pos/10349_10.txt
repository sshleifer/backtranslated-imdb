This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly about the need to make movies at all. In general, I am a fan of movies based on true stories worthy. And this one is great! In addition to Meryl's performance which has gained much recognition and praise, the film's greatest asset is the story on which it is based. The fascinating story of a couple who suffered social and legal torture, after suffering tremendous emotional pain as a result of the unexpected and brutal death of their young child, is truly a telling fable that exposes the inhuman side of his fellow men and reveals the barbarism of a very refined and legal society. It is interesting to see how those who consider themselves as kind and intelligent (the ladies of the emotional jury in the film, for example) are in reality only selfish dupes who, for their dogmatic beliefs and their prejudices, close their heads to deliberation. and contemplation, even in the light of all the facts that point very clearly against their opinions. The other face of the so-called "civilized" society that the film exposes is the apathy vis-Ã -vis the suffering of human beings (it goes without saying that it is very general, even if this tale takes place in Australia ), that goes so far. like becoming a real cruelty. You have to see if you are ready to take something serious and maybe to think.
