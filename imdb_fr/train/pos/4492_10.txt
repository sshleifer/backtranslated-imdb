but I want to say that I can not agree more with Moira. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I just thought about it this morning, wanting to give some serious advice. who had lost money on his debit card by fraud and wanted to say "keep your money in your pocket" and realize that I was talking like James Mason. <br /> <br /> Even though he did not say those words, I still think he would! I never forgot "Do you wear?" in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: "Always have money in your pockets!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Not enough children have fathers with such ruthless but well-intentioned attitudes. Or any father. <br /> <br /> It would be good for us to re-establish "you", "your" and "your" in our language to show that we care about it. It's only the same as "tutoyer" in French or "du" in German. <br /> <br /> Addendum: I just realized that many of my remarks were about James Mason in The Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think it's because I confused Susan George and Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /> <br /> I stand by the comments though. <br /> <br /> And the spring and port wine looks a lot like The Family Way. <br /> <br /> When you brought a friend to the photos at the time, you really had something to say and talk about, something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theatrical experiences are almost real, and they are important to help young people grow up. <br /> <br /> It does not happen now, I think, that teenagers can just go to the pictures as we did.
