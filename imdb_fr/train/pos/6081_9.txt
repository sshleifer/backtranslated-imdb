You do not become darker or more tragic than "Othello" and this film captures the piece quite well, with exceptional performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne expresses the torment of Othello to the viewer while he is prey to Iago's lies in a very convincing way, even with a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's vengeance against Othello, or the object of his anger (we do not know which one since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also walk in the scenes, although they, like Iago, seem more crucial for the plot. I did not check the film against the piece to see how many lines had been cut, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the most seemingly unimportant, very well. <br /> <br /> If I had one, the criticism of the film would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between certain characters are not more detailed. The director had an excellent cast, and no one offered a bad performance. The relations between Cassio and Othello and those between Emilia and Desdemona still need to be developed earlier in the film. I feel that they are closer to each other than the film suggests, although you have an idea of ​​this very late in the film. In addition, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other gives the impression that they have just met. On the other hand, maybe the group just met - like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short: good performance, too short. <br /> <br />
