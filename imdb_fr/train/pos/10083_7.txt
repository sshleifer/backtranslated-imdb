The fact that the film was shot in DVD, always formatted on television and with a blurred image, really displeased many purists of the film ...... and rightly so. This deserves better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street artist who needs a son to transmit his art (rules of the day) and ends up with a little girl (unconventional). and the problems that ensue thereafter. The old man had bought the child at a slave auction and quickly discovered that the child was not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case. <br /> <br /> The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a nice funny face with a missing tooth and a contagious smile." The little girl "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is a cute. story tells how the two manage after that, and I usually enjoy a nice sentimental end, but a little carried away in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a story full of drama, suspense, humor and sadness.Do not expect a good quality photo for the money you spend on DVD: rent it until it appears on a widescreen.
