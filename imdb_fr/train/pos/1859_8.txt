In his debut as a director, Denzel Washington tells a true story that turns out to be also a very difficult story and presents it on screen with an honesty that we expect from Washington's acting efforts, but we now see this contact as a director. <br /> <br /> We have recently seen some of the disastrous results of children who have fallen out of public protection. This story tells of a nightmarish existence that leaves appalling traces, but ultimately suggests the triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> We can tackle the problems of first effort with too many close-ups and not the best of these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power can not be underestimated . <br /> <br /> If the academy neglects this film, it will be a masquerade. This film makes no noise and addresses the difficult facts of history with a purity that does not generally exceed that of a novel on screen. This is of course a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy, so go see him and tell your friends to see him too!
