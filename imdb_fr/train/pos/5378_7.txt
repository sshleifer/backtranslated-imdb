It's an interesting little movie made in 1967, with jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a scenario that will make you laugh ... Okay, it's not really stupid but it's fun. I have seen a lot of similarities between this and "Blue Hand Creature" (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! Scotland Yard studies the murders of girls in a college. It seems like criminals are released from a local prison to obey a perverse person, and then fired once their work is done. There is a clever device hidden in a Bible that sucks prussic acid, and another device that is neither Chichois nor clandestine, it looks like a big water pistol and the victim must be practically soaked before exhaling . Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector. He chews mainly chewing gum and looks away. There is a "monk", and everyone calls him a "monk", he wears a whip and wears a red hooded red outfit, more than one Klan member of a different color than the one of a monk. There are all sorts of nifty devices like a fireplace going up and down to let in the monk, and the monk goes over the fire without putting his robe on fire, a nifty trick here. It's a strange mix of police drama and crazy arguments. Although it's pretty stupid at times, it's fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad ....
