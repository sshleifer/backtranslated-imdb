A shocking and well-made cooler is an underrated account of atrocious assassination and evil forces. <br /> <br /> A small town doctor tries to find out who, or what, is committing a series of violent sexual murders. <br /> Incubus is a narrow mystery, with some horrific killing sequences, which creates a quirky and strange climatic twist. The scenes of murder are intense and bloody, so it's not a movie for dummies! The direction of John Hough, associated with a strange musical score, combine to create a dark and scary atmosphere that runs through the film. It also carries a kind of Gothic atmosphere. Pleasant filming locations and some stylish camera work are also worthy of note. <br /> <br /> The casting is not bad either. The great John Cassavetes makes a strong performance as a new doctor in town. The performances of Kerrie Keane as a local journalist, Helen Hughes as a city historian and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teenager are also noteworthy. <br /> <br /> All around Incubus is a movie - discovered and reevaluated. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
