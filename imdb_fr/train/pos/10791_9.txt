A true hero of modern times, Chuck Norris has left television "Walker, Rexas Ranger" and is turning to new stages for his artistic career. The Man of the President is the second film of a future television series, with Norris in the lead and young actors like Jennifer Tung or Judson Mills (one of the young riders of "Walker"). The old master teaches the young aspirant. This is one of the most powerful themes of "The Man of the President". At that time, "A line in the sand" surprised the world for its treatment of terrorism in the United States, a few months before the tragic 11 September. Eric Norris, Chuck's son, is the director. The film is fun, a good work of action, a lot of fights and heroism. Chuck Norris has many plans for the future. Bells of innocence, his next picture will be next. <br /> <br />
