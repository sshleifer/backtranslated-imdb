It's the silly movie of a thinking man. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, it could well become a cult classic, as was the case for my wife and myself - the voice "Cary" and Jack Nicholson as than Martians to a too simplistic population. of Big haric is a movie that you can watch through or watch carefully and enjoy each other. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, but if you like to relax with easy humor, quickly take the mind to see the joke. as it slides, you will enjoy this movie.
