The pretty Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being approached by a lonely biker. She is mortally shaken by the fact that her attacker knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker breaks into Marjorie's house and submits it to a humiliating terror. Murdered and bleeding, Marjorie manages to gain the upper hand over his attacker, removing the devil from the light of day and makes him helpless with a wasp throw in the eyes and throat. The pork tied and beaten himself, Joe tries to explain to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they return home. There is almost a hint of mercy, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should she continue to make her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and coarse language make it possible to get the grade R. Fawcett really gets away from the roles of ditsy who would stain his career forever. Congratulations to director Robert M. Young.
