Theodore Rex is perhaps the greatest cinematographic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this convincing intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns with the great filmmakers of the twentieth century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are breathtaking and give any Spielberg work a banal and elemental appearance. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary jewel that he raised the bar of filmmaking to levels never anticipated by filmmakers. The idea of ​​creating not only a movie featuring a dinosaur, but also to adapt an action-packed crime novel and co-watching a "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name such as "Theodore" has changed the l humanity as we know it. The world could not be the same after an experience of such beauty. Watching Theodore Rex comes back to looking in the face of God and hearing him say, "You are my most beloved creation." This is one of the few movies that is simply dying !!!
