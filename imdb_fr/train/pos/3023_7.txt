This pleasant black miner enjoys a leading cast and many memorable scenes. The great distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents. The Spanish characters in the film are performed by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And to top it off, Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good, especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet and speak with extremely different accents is really fun! And I suppose, seeing how alone they were, that they should have spoken in Spanish anyway! It seems odd that the Warner brothers did not find any Spanish-speaking actor in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood has often had a policy of "any old accent will do" - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch), who falls in love with a Russian soldier portrayed by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro) Maybe they should have chosen Novarro for "Agent confidant" - it would have been great in the role of Boyer or at least in that of Francen (which would have significantly reduced the budget of implementation dark).
