My left foot, in my opinion, is a great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The performances were shattering, the soundtrack was excellent and the casting perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, even though I did not understand what he was saying most of the time. Moreover, when he had a temper tantrum, I was a little scared. In addition, he is so sad that he suffers from cerebral palsy. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or a biopic, I highly recommend this great biopic on one of the world's most talented writers and painters. You will enjoy and have a good time, so do not miss this one.
