I say that the domino principle is an extremely underrated film. All who took the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and many others can only conclude that the author of the Principe domino really knew what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe be even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.en mention a few. It's not really a fiction, but a disturbing part of our complicated existential history. We help, but the principle of domino is much more real than fantasy.If it causes a small loss of sleep, perhaps should not I take my word, investigation for yourself.
