This is one of my favorite comedies. Not wanting to tolerate the uninteresting lifestyle of his hero, but taken for what it is worth and not as commonplace alcoholism, the film is simply very entertaining. It tells the unlikely story of a single boy named Arthur who will inherit a huge, irresponsible fortune 40, but only if he marries Susan, chosen because his family thinks she could do something with him. Arthur offers, but falls blindly for Linda, a waitress and a little thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the world's most endearing addict, whose antics make you laugh every minute. It is true that Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor in the role. The ladies in the room are also well represented. Liza Minnelli flickers under the name of Linda and her on-screen chemistry with Moore is excellent. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the rich and most appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film is literally directed by Sir John Gielgud, who describes Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. It is evident that these two had a great mutual affection during Hobson's long-time employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and provider of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not at all Arthur's romance, but his unusual relationship with this witty servant and of course perpetual disapproving. This is the butler you will remember best long after the last credits.
