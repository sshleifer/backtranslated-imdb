Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on the screen and it might be their best film together. <br /> <br /> Yes, Hold Your Man can be cheesy and predictable, but that's not what I like in the movie. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are just wonderful. It's obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that's partly what makes this film so wonderful. <br /> <br /> The witty dialogue, the superb script and the attention to detail are the other factors that make this film such a good film. I liked this movie the first time I saw it and at every subsequent viewing, I always notice at least one new detail. For me, it's the mark of a great movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and the scenario are better than most of the films of this period (beginning of the 30's). I love classical movies, but I admit that most of them are only average and sometimes do not hold my interest. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> This is largely due to the fact that Hold Your Man is a "pre-code" movie. (The Hays code was only applied a year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not have been made under the code. Well, it could have been done, but it would have been a totally different story. Thank God, the code was not applied until 1934. Otherwise, we would have missed this jewel.
