I consider this film as a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 to 5 times to see it, in order to realize how great this movie was. First, he describes a World War II face that we do not usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, the German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are more "humanized". One of the things that impressed me most was the mention, at the end of the film, of a murder committed in a forest in the last twenty years ... this forest is the place where the last ones take place. Berlin Alexanderplatz chapters: these are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details is the representation of the doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they walk through a door or door is open. Many doors are displayed on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change their personality, acts, etc. whenever that happens. Have you noticed that?
