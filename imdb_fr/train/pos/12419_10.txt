I like this film like no other. Another time, I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated, but for now, let me quote some passages from this remarkable dialogue, which, remember, is only talkative. Australians and Poms will understand, everyone is fine? <br /> <br /> (title of the title song) "he can drink a beer, he can choose a funny one, in his last Bondi double-breasted equipment." > <br /> (another song) "All pommis are bastards, bastards or worse, and England is the ** hole of the universe." <br /> <br /> (during a television interview "artistic program"): Mr. Mackenzie, which artists have impressed you most since your arrival in England? (Barry's answer) Flamin 'bull-artists! <br /> <br /> (while chatting with a naive girl of pom-poms): Mr. Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of aboriginal servants in Australia? (Barry's answer) Abos? I have never seen an Abo in my life. Mom does the bulk of the solid yacca (hard work) around us. <br /> <br /> This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this Australian film. If you can get a copy, look and enjoy.
