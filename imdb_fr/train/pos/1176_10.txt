First, let me tell you that I did not like the fact that The Rock won the gay title. Then I think that Regal should have recovered his European title. Jeff Hardy is a shit champion. Rob Van Dam had the title Intercontinental for too long already that Brock should have won. I am happy that Storm and Christian are champions, the best match was the match Booker T and Big Show in my opinion.
