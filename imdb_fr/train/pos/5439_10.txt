Obviously, a film that has had a great influence not only on the kind of boyfriend but also on the action genre. George Lucas was to be a fan of this movie, as much of his Star Wars series seems to be a tribute to Gunga Din. The characters played by Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are only precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din has turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and likes it or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today, this film is considered a non-PC, but Eduardo Ciannelli delivered a speech as a guru. the Indian opposition leader to the British Raj could echo the sentiments of many today. <br /> <br /> For a young boy, it was a good movie. Three strong men lead and only a hint of romance. There was a time when young boys deemed to have kissed the girl in the morning of Saturday's movie were simply soft. Not like today, when more skin is greeted with delight. Too late to lament the lost innocence. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this movie will not be forgotten and some of those who surf the channels will stop at MCT and capture a movie with action, adventure and thousands of people instead of CGI actors.
