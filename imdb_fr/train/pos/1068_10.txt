I think Dark Angel is awesome! The first season was excellent and there was good ground. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5, creating Manticore, trying to adapt to a normal life while "saving the world". And being hunted by manticore throughout the season, which gives a bit of spice to the series. <br /> <br /> The second season has suddenly become a little strange compared to the first. The plot has disappeared a bit and the series has lost some of its charm, mainly because of all the strange "creatures" that appear. Do not get me wrong, the second season is good, but with a little too much "manticores". However, they managed to return to a promising new plot in the last episodes of season 2, in which I had much hope to see more. <br /> <br /> I really wish they could start creating new episodes. And with James Cameron behind all that, it can not go bad. In conclusion, I would say that it is an excellent series, but I still hope for a third season!
