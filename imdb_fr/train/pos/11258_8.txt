Spoilers! Classic sex basket of the 70s! Swedish (Helga) was what made this film so great. She was beautiful, but what really caught me was how sexual she was. She released massive amounts of sexuality throughout the film. Her best scenes were when she was stimulated. Every time she was on the screen, I felt pierced. <br /> <br /> Dr. Julia (the director's very confused sister) was very interesting visually. Although most 12-year-old girls had breasts larger than Julia, she knew how to use the little she had and her scenes (especially the scenes with the silk blouse and the black skirt) also attracted my attention. attention ruthlessly. You must also love the major hoaky scene where bats have stripped his nekkid; I do not know if I've seen anything more ridiculous and sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
