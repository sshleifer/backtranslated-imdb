I have just seen this recently, after an interval of almost forty years. He resists well, especially the remarkable songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who will he buy" with his magical counterpoint, a remarkable example?) <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the other post who criticized his G. The scoring system , then brand new at the time, had never meant that the note G (general) meant "totally free of conflict". <br /> <br /> To characterize it as inappropriate for children reminds me of the description I once saw. The Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives in a foreign country and kills the first person she meets. She then goes on a trip with three male companions and kills again.
