Nobody really understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie movies, but ?? honestly ?? why should we disturb? Each film in Zombi's "series" offers fun, voracious and fun shocks, and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite all the production difficulties that occurred during filming. This film started as an interesting project by Lucio Fulci, who had to further develop his success of "Zombi 2", but it turned out to be a typical Bruno Mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films . The scenario is desperately inept and ignores all forms of continuity. All the ingenious ideas of George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Crazies" are shamelessly repeated here and the performances are really miserable and painful to watch. Yet all this did not upset me for a moment because the sublime gore over-the-top compensates for everything! On a secret army base in the Philippines, scientists have developed the bacterial warfare virus "Death One" and prepared it for transport. After an unsuccessful attempt to steal the virus, the corpse of an infected terrorist is cremated and the ashes of zombies contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors has to face hyperactive and inhumanly powerful zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls who have been instructed to kill anything that moves in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to "The City of Nightmares" by Umberto Lenzi. Really bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast action sequences and several very creative zombie craziness situations. The undead birds were original, for example, and the entire zombie birth sequence at the abandoned hospital was also pretty cool. The infamous flying-head scene is not as ugly as it was prepared and fits perfectly into this very nice and cheesy Italian zombie movie. Recommended to fans; do not pay attention to negative reviews.
