In my opinion, this is a very good show of celebrity sketches. I liked seeing Greg Kinnear as a host. I said that for many reasons. Even though Hal Sparks was an acceptable host, I sometimes wish that Greg Kinnear did not leave. If you ask me, it seems that no one is left with a TV show throughout its broadcast. Despite everything, I enjoyed seeing the various guests and other people usurping celebrities. If you ask me, it was damn funny. Before concluding, I must say that I miss this show a little. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this show to all your fans of hardcore sketches. You will really enjoy it.
