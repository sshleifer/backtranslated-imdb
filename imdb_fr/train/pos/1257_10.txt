I read a number of reviews on this movie and I have to say "What's wrong with you?!?!" It was an excellent movie! I thought this movie was beautiful from start to finish and that the story was extremely well told. I am convinced that people who did not like this film did not pay much attention to it. There are a number of very important scenes in which, if you are not careful, you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I urge all those who do not like this film to see him again and to watch him alone so that you can really pay attention. The story seemed perfectly logical and, as I said, very well told. Each scene of the film has a point and everything fits at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role, as always. Laurence Fishburne was superb as Tanny Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a good idea and seemed fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I did not expect much from him, but he did a great performance. Ed Harris was the real gem of the movie. He plays a really sick person and makes you really see how disturbed his character is. Look at his eyes in his scenes, just beautiful !!! In addition, there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (in the role of Kate) in one of her leading roles ... this is not a bad place to start. Excellent distribution in this movie! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to all those who love the members of the cast or just the thrillers. It's a very good movie and should be seen. Do not listen to the opinions of all the others, go see the movie and draw your own conclusions. I hope you will see the movie and enjoy it as much as me. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
