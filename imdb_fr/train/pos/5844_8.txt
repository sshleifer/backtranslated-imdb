In 1948, it was my favorite movie of all time. Betty Grable's costumes were so lovely that I wanted to grow to become her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as a dashing Hungarian officer. As stupid and hairy as this film may seem at the beginning, I had the impression, at the age of eight, to talk about relations between men and women. I saw him again the other day; I was surprised to find that was still the case.
