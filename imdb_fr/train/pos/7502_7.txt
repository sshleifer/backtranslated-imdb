Although I did not really feel anything about Lance's character, I felt that his wife could have done a lot better with someone else. It could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time developing the character, perhaps with Lance. I would have liked better. <br /> <br /> However, I totally agree with DoyleLuver, when they said "And to quote the character of Glenn Quinn, Ben:" I'm the star here, that's right, I am the talented! "" If you watch the movie, look at it, even if it's in the background ... just its facial expressions, all in the eyes, you know what motivates Ben, exactly what he feels by compared to comments, even if it's a quick glance behind the character. Excellent game in a fair movie.
