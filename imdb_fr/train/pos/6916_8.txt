Winchester '73 was the film that allowed Mann to move from B-movies to the big league, thus saving James Stewart's difficult career in the post-war era by portraying him as a conflicting hero (although since he inherited Fritz Lang's project, perhaps Lang deserves credit for that). The two men would go to much darker places - Mann with the remarkably dark devil's front door, which MGM kept until Broken Arrow's success convinced them to release her? but a film about a man stalking his own brother while the title gun is handed from one person to another along the trail before he finds himself in one of the filmmaker's beloved shootings mountain is even stronger than what you would expect from the system studio. Great dialogue, an impressive support casting ?? Dan Duryea, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson among them ?? and Mann's exceptional visual sense raises the bar with it.
