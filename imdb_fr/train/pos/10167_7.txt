I was not at all a fan of seeing this movie, but when my girlfriend called me and told me that she had a free pass for the advanced projection, I only tagged her to see Eva Longoria and laugh at the antics of Jason Biggs. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was actually better than I expected but not much. it was like a hybrid of losing a guy in 10 days and like a paradise. a typical romantic comedy with its moments I guess. The film was quite short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, to develop the character's development and to have a happy and decent ending. the idea of ​​a ghost haunting her ex-husband was an interesting plot to follow. eva has kept the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the actors (especially jason biggs) have made sure that the laughter is coming at a steady pace. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked the movie only because it had a lot of laughs to keep me, otherwise I would have given this movie a lower note. hey, it's a chick film and I'm looking at this movie with a guy's eyes, it's more of an honest fight if the women commented on it and thought about it.
