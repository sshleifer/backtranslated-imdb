I am not a very good writer, so I will stay brief. World at War is the best documentary I've seen on the Second World War. I've seen different documentaries about World War II (not just English / North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete documentary about World War II I've seen. I think it might be a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it's a very good job to cover the war. It seems to be complete and objective / just for everyone. This does not exaggerate or diminish the roles of different nations. It contains many original sequences, including color sequences and numerous eyewitnesses (it was shot in the '70s, while many others were still alive). He has good music and narrator. In total, I gave this one 10/10, because it's so good. (I have not seen a DVD promotion, so I can not talk about it)
