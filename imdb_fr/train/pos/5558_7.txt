This story is familiar in Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened with expulsion if they do not catch the mouse (Jerry) . Tom has an unnamed buddy ("Butch?") Who lives in the house with him, so it really upsets "Mammy Two Shoes" who can not believe they have a mouse despite TWO cats in the house. <br /> <br /> Anyway, whoever catches Jerry can stay while the other has the boot, the competition is launched! <br /> <br /> Even though it's a familiar territory, I've always enjoyed it because the cartoon had enough to make it entertaining. You not only had the cats compete against each other, but Jerry in the equation too, so there were enough good gags to definitely recommend if you're a Tom & Jerry fan.
