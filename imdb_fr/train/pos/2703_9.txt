I'm not a big fan of the kitsch camp and the type of vision "so bad it's good". However, I really like this movie for its fun aspect and, believe it or not, it's an innovation. <br /> <br /> Everything has a ring of John Waters and is excited without bounds, but with great actors and considered direction making the best of slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane moves with an incredible expression (see the scene in the bus for a text lesson on how to use the movement) and is framed by unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You might not like this movie, you might not like it, but if you have the chance to watch it, save the time, because it is very likely that you will end the movie with a confused smile, and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some big stars. Highly recommended.
