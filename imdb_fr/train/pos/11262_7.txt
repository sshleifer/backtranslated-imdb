THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second production attempt of Joseph Sarno - and although I would say it's much nicer than the painfully dull and unoteric Swedish WILDCATS, it's still a bit slow and unclear to my taste. <br /> <br /> This is centered on a group of vampire girls who live in a castle and wish to resurrect their assassinated "leader". To do this, girls have to dance naked, kiss and sing weird stuff - and of course drink blood. When a doctor and his brother's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for shelter, they are the perfect blood bank for excited vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they appear ... <br /> THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of the TV companies operating in the early 70's. A lot of nudity - including slightly frontal nuances and lugubrious - including incest and of course blood suckers ... but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards. Some very hot women in this movie would have enjoyed more explicit sex, but I guess you can not have everything. I would have also benefited from a more intense / bloody violence, namely that this is a vampire movie, but I think the goal of THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING was more about showcasing the skin, not the blood. Still a bit slow - and most of the time, the acting is absolutely wooden - but you can expect something from that time and budget. Worth the drive to exploit the fans - others may find it a little too boring for them. 7/10
