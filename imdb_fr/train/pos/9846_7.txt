Ok, at first it sounded like "Shrek" - the lonely one that is continually followed by comic relief. This becomes something really fascinating as the glove is adjusted. And the result is a nice film, with moments that I recognize too dramatic for children (the past of Manny, for example). The premise has obviously been worked on for a long time, so that they can successfully make a film set with almost no different scenery (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It is good to know that they are doing something emotional. As I said, there can sometimes be jolts, so, children, be warned. The real disappointment is the animation. It was not as hooked as the fairy-tale movies or Shrek, and it shows. Humans are unrealistic, and we have already seen better examples of CGI. But do not let this stain the disc: solo, "Ice Age" is commendable. And that will gather a lot of fans, I do not doubt it. Oh yes, the moments with this little mouse are priceless and flying.
