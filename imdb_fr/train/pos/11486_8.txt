I saw this film at Rotterdam IFF. You may question some of the manufacturer's decisions - for example, choosing a dummy form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this film will surely touch you. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. I hope he gets the distribution he deserves.
