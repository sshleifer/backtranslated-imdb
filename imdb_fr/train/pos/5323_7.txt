There are a number of things that are not correct, although it is not too important since what happened to who and when is still in dispute. The most blatant freedom with the facts, I think, is when they start playing Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller, when in fact they play Indra and go to the Kaiserkeller later. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was skewed in favor of Pete Best's version, but if he is the history consultant, then I guess he's calling the shots. I also agree with Semprinni that the recordings on which Pete Best plays say the last word on the reason for his dismissal. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is not as sumptuous as the last movie "Backbeat", I prefer this film because it is more accurate and has a better script with a deeper characterization . <br /> <br /> There's a lot in the movie that's pretty substantial - like Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact that he was "bickering", only to find out that the band knew he was gay since beginning. Small touches like the group entering a caf√© and commander "Corn-Flakes mit Milch". My favorite scene, which actually has bass, is when Stuart Sutcliffe just bought his bass guitar at an audition but can not play it. He stands in front of the impresario and tries to simulate it, but is caught. It's rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
