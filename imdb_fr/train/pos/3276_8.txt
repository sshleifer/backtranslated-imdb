49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with Anna fever (Charlotte Burke), aged 11, has only drawings to keep her company. Her health gradually deteriorates as a series of mysterious "black outs" grab her. In each of these episodes, she dreams of a house in a desolate field, populated only by a sick and invalid boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers). When a dark and unknown danger threatens his idyllic "kiosk", Marc's life is put in danger. His life is also in danger because his dreams reflect his own state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: The first haunted feature film by British director Bernard Rose. From Catherine Storr's fable ("Marianne Dreams"), he leaves behind many other "original" fantastic works. When a story is about dreams and nightmares, it's hard to give it the mix of fable and reality to make it work as a movie. The director Rose successfully captures the aspect of children's fantasy world as well as the darkness that seeks to usurp them. <br /> <br /> Feverishly scarred by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music with discernment to "get out of her seat" with meticulousness. moments. Most thrillers are very sloppy in this important aspect of frightening the public by asking them not to know what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures the suspense and never leaves it or does not tread loosely in the aftermath of events. In addition, his mastery of placing objects in the frame (as in his P.O.V.shots) gives cinematography an extra dimension that would otherwise seem to be lacking. It is only in Europe that you will find places as threatening as those presented here: the isolated house, the fields, the coastal towns, the watchtower, etc. <br /> <br /> Rose would follow this film with "Candyman" (1992), a true horror jewel for "thinkers" and a cult favorite of cult worship.
