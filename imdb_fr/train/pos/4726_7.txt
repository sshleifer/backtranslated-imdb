The origins of this film are a mystery to me, as I only know what IMDB knew before renting it. I guess before "Starship Troopers", "Killshot" was one of the countless unseen pilots who had never been to a network, cable or otherwise. The new title of "Kill Shot" is comically thrown in the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues indicating that it was never intended for the cinema. The fast cuts, the melodious Melrose Place music and clear 2-second shots from the main actors let you know what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> And that does not bother me. all. I rented this film when I saw the repackaging that put Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net, thinking it would be fun to see them in a film in addition to the tragedy of Starship Troopers (a excellent book, in my opinion), not so hot a movie - but that's another criticism). After looking on IMDB, my roommate and I had assumed that the pilot had been coached after the apparent success of the Troopers and Richards career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to achieve coveted R-rated status - coveted in the video rental sections, that is to say. In any case, they should have left the movie unrated if you are trying to sell it in the Suspense / Softcore Porn section. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's entertaining. I hate spoiling the pleasure of telling you that it's a TV pilot. It was the biggest asset to watch him. When you expect a movie and a TV show, the differences between them are clearer than usual. <br /> <br /> Would I rent it again? Would I watch this TV show? Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts to touch all the demographics had gone well in the mid-90s. A black man (who avoids the taboo of interracial dating on television), an Asian man (Japanese, I guess the name Koji) , more adept at science and computing than talking to women, beautiful and smart student in pre-med education Everything was planned for her, except the bank account of her family. This show would probably have worked well. <br /> <br /> But as a film, it makes me crack. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what he was forced to become. This made the evening very pleasant and that's all I ask for rentals.
