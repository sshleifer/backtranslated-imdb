Perhaps the best book of Isabel Allende, House of the Spirits describes an alternative Chilean story, this one full of magic, a mystical veil and a kind of omnipresent sadness. This film brings together a superb cast, plus an excellent artistic direction, with a scenario that can not contain all the quality of this book. It is unusual for an almost unknown country like Chile to be so well represented by this film, whose only sin is perhaps to aim too high, and which, as a result, left the illiterate public a little upset, mainly because he understood very little.
