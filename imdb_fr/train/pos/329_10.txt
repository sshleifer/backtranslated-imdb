Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or any Greek mythological story about it), it is in my opinion the best of all. Almost faithful to the original scenario - with some minor deviations and omissions, eg. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the sinner recognizes Ulysses disguised in his hut - a realistic acting game and authentic landscapes and costumes contribute to making this garment a memorable masterpiece, and not a Hollywood snipe with a sword and sandals. Although the dialogue and the subtitles are entirely in Italian, if you know the scenario, it can always synthesize what happens and what the actors say (provided you have a good practical text of the Odyssey at your fingertips). At least, yes, and so much so that it inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the film.
