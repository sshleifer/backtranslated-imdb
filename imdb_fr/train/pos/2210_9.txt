I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite host in the series, hands down. I hate celebrity gossip and do not usually like talk shows, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, it was a must-see program for me. I rarely missed an episode during his run, and was saddened when the guest guests started pouring in (although most guests still do a great job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all those who do not like Hal Sparks, I guess they have never seen the weekend specials. It was a one-hour episode of Talk Soup that featured the best clips of the week and was complemented by comedy sketches. The original songs Hal Sparks made were hilarious. In one of them, he was possessed by a demon of bad comedy and, in a scene similar to that of the exorcist, his head twisted as he told jokes about food for plane. An episode was dedicated to making fun of Multiplicity, while a group of clones, Hal Sparks, multiplied throughout the episode, overwhelming the studio. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe it does not sound as funny when I describe them, but all I know is that, apart from Talk Soup, the other two shows that I I watched regularly during these years were The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian. So, if you like the humorous style of these shows, you'll probably love Talk Soup during the Sparks years. <br /> <br /> That said, Henson and Tyler were also great facilitators. The three guests brought something different to the table, but they were all good comics in my opinion. Of course, throughout the years Tyler and guest star, my interest in this show began to fade, but from time to time, I catch The Soup, the spiritual successor of the show, and of course, the new host can bring unexpected laughter <br /> <br /> OK, I've lost enough time to talk about a TV show that is no longer airing and running on a channel I usually hate. Go look something else!
