I must admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can not surpass a person with a strong cinematic presence. A Chinese fantasy image may not be easy to present to an audience, the director has tried to bring back the classic fancy tales of Zu Mountain and that's what he posted. <br /> <br /> The new legend of Zu has really improved from that of 1983. From this update of the new millennium, we can see the vision of Tsui Hark on the Zu mountains. Spectacular visual designs, a fantastic action-fantasy epic made beautifully. Keep me glued across the entire picture. Super casting with just playing well. It's really a fun movie to watch, but is it too strange? <br /> <br /> Now, the downside is that people will definitely be confused with its long story told in a 95-minute film. The plot may not have much relationship between the characters, but by watching the movie again, you'll have a better idea of ​​the characters' understanding. Some may complain about the lack of physical combat aside, with characters endowed with supernatural powers to defeat their enemies, minds fighting in hand-to-hand combat would not really make sense. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this beautiful, elegant image. It may be a thin story, but look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide" movie, the plot has also baffled us, but it was really something stylish and awesome. Tsui Hark always attracts something different in H.K. Cinema. The American public may have a hard time understanding this movie because it's not a squatting Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it's a whole new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, its special effects are really better than the Storm Riders. It is definitely worth checking out.
