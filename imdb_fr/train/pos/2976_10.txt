For a comedy, this has a decent and inventive plot and the comic timing of Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of fun moments in this fantastic movie. I particularly like the multitude of colors and the way in which the sports arena scenes compete. Robert Stacks The unresolved parodic mysteries is also very entertaining.
