As in Amelie, recent French films seem to adopt a stereotyped relationship between men and women, centered on a woman who finds a real love for her. In this case, despair leads to a convict, which leads to its evolution into a prototype of the crowd. Intelligent story and surprising in many ways, except that the woman is there to support the boy. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, the subtitles are a little fast, but not unreasonable. <The soundtrack, as it seems to be more and more the case with European films, is excellent and in perfect synchronization with the variations of the film. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of various urban horror movies. There is a feeling of Wes Craven in Chicago.
