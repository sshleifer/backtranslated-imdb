Of course, Star Wars (a movie I have seen at least fifty times) beats all the others in special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> He has horror (non graphic), romance, robots, spiritual repartee, intelligence, special effects (surprisingly good) and drama. <br /> <br /> I saw this film a few years ago in a revival with a new imprint, and I was amazed held today. I thought old-fashioned electronics looked like the 40's, but it looked futuristic and modern. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and barefoot with childlike innocence hard to beat still gets a climb out of me. <br /> <br /> The Krell monster appearing in the ray of the ray still scares the bejebees out of me. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know that the "Big Bird of the Galaxy" probably modeled a lot of "Star Trek" of this movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody has yet beaten Robby, the robot, in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This film, on the whole, is the standard to which all other science fiction films will have to compete! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention for the haunting electronic score that kept us all on pins and needles.
