It's a good movie. He has a captivating story, a great main character, a very good performance and a killer action. This happens mainly in 2036 but shows scenes that took place in previous years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is very well done and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a soldier by the name of Todd who has been trained to kill since birth and who, like all other soldiers, has never had a normal life. Finally, the army introduces new soldiers, younger, faster and stronger. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, they no longer need old soldiers like Todd. They test the new soldiers by fighting some of the former soldiers. During the battle, Russell is wounded and presumed dead. The army is laying down its body along with some other people assuming they are all dead, but what they do not realize is that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds on this planet a camp full of civilization that the army dropped on. For a moment, he lives there but can not adapt to a normal life. He rarely says a word and is sometimes very aggressive towards others. When they feel that he is a danger to them, they send him to the desert. <br /> <br /> Just like Russell's departure, the planet is attacked by the new soldiers. What the military has forgotten is to train the soldiers to be intelligent like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd easily surpasses them. The military is starting to realize it and Todd kills all their men except one. This one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fighting scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell is obviously the winner. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've seen and seen a lot. This has everything you can ask for in a movie, including some highlights. The writer has not forgotten either that Russell had never seen a woman before, because he even calls women "sir". This film has no holes, every minute has a reason to be and it is very funny. <br /> <br /> An awesome action movie with a single army for Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action fans. This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / science fiction fans.
