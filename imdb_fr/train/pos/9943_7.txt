The film never claims to be spectacular, unlike many movies. The film presents itself as a fun and entertaining moment. And that's exactly what it was. This is the Korean version of the male character Bring It On. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you can feel the rest of the film and its unfolding, but the pleasure is neither in the twists nor in the surprise the way the film is a true copy of another . Instead, the joy lies in the journey of how the remaining 2 "thugs" became full men. Therefore, the film is fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera, especially the cart movements, have been very well executed. The scenario, being a little weak, was too much fun in the fact that the characters were not two-dimensional but full of life and desire. This film will not win any Oscar or DVD blockbusters, but a fun watch and a fun experience.
