Maybe I'm partial to the foxes, the fox stories and everything but I thought it was wonderfully well done. I really appreciated that it was shown when Lily was not comfortable, like the fire and the room (trying not to mess around here). I think it's important for kids to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After reading a few comments, I'm a little confused, we say that in the end, the mother and son appear, because it is she who tells his story to his son. The movie I saw did NOT have the mother or the son at the end, but a painting of a girl with a fox. Can someone enlighten me on this? Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes may be a little slow, which may be difficult for energetic children. It's always worth it if they can sit still.
