Holes, originally a Louis Sachar novel, has been successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film. With Sigourney Weaver as a guardian, Shia Labeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well interpreted and the actors described their roles well. <br /> <br /> The film had interlaced intrigues that leads to the end. The main scenario concerns Stanley Yelnats and his punishment of having spent a year and a half at Greenlake camp. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot deals with racism and this is the deeper story of the film. The third concerns Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse inflicted on the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these stories were very well assembled. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the belief of many people, I think it is not necessary to have read the book to understand the film. The film is reasonably easy to understand. <br /> <br /> The action in the film is well done, including Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (the guardian) and Jon Voight (Mr. Sir). Other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray), enhance the comic relief of the film. . However, Zero and Stanley were a great team. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney movie, it deals with serious issues such as racism, shootings and violence. The dramatization of the film at times is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether they read the book or not. You should not miss it.
