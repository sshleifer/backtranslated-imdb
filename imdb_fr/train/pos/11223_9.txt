Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the world of gambling proud. The different movements with the wrists had to be learned because throwing craps is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I was hoping that the "good girl" would cry for her grave, instead of that of her boyfriend. Especially with her remarks about "going to her best friend's funeral," when she first meets Matt. And of course, you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid at Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (Bruce Dern's interesting role). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! Some of the other Hollywood feats happen, but the writing is so excellent, the actors play so neat that you are perfectly unconscious. <br /> <br /> And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD. We return to the 1950s when our "native passions" were released for the first time by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a bit of racism in Chicago, but in a club called "Biloxi" with a Confederate flag supporting racist remarks. I will watch it again, just to hear the music. Fortunately I have the sound track FACTOTUM, so I can listen in the car. Look at the two together and you'll see how Matt matured ... playing bar room characters in both cases. He owns a bar at Paramount Hotel in New York, he is likely to have a good education. Great actor, becoming his own. He shows finely nuanced performances ... the good and the bad in his characters. His "young boy on the farm" is an excellent study, made particularly poignant by his bassett eyes. He makes love, convincingly too. Since he was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder how ... to make love with an actress with whom you grew up a bit. Add conviction, I'll say that.
