Carmen is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's hard to say which performance is the best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are superb. They dance their souls. It is a beautiful story of inseparability of life and myth; the myth penetrates everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life is danced. Real people live at the same time their own life and become someone else, play the role of lovers of the old. The magic continues.
