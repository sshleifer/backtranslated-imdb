Stories from the Crypt: And throughout the house starts on Christmas Eve, while Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband, Joseph (Marshall Bell). radio bulletin that indicates that a murderous maniac (Larry Drake) disguised as Santa has escaped from a local mental asylum and that he has already killed several women while Elizabeth is on her list, but she has other ideas his advantage ... <br /> <br /> The story of Tales from the Crypt is episode 2 of Season 1, directed by one of the usual executive producers of the series, Robert Zemeckis , and throughout the house is a pretty decent watch. Fred Dekker's script is actually based on a story in the comic book 'The Vault of Horror'. woman character here played by Ellen Trainor. This particular version is pretty good but does not do anything different or special and is a bit too linear and predictable to be considered a classic. With only 25 minutes long, it certainly advances at a good pace, the story is quite macabre and generally offers decent entertainment and I enjoyed the decent end. This time, there are Christmas-themed opening and closing segments, Crypt Keeper (John Kassir), with the usual word games. <br /> <br /> Director Zemeckis does a good job. . There is not a lot of gore here, someone has a poker stuck in his head, someone's face is cut with an ice cube, someone's arm is cut with an ax and there are splashes of blood but in general it is not this graph. Playing in a small cast is pretty good. <br /> <br /> And throughout the house is not the best tale of the crypt, but it's still a decent film, worth the detour but deserves the story of the comic Original 1972 version did we really need or even wanted that?
