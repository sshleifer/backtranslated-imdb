The third film by Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. This is yet another adaptation of Burlesque, which apparently was popular at the time. <br /> <br /> The original Burlesque play was performed on Broadway during the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances. This is the role played by Carole Lombard Barbara Stanwyck is from Broadway who brought her to Hollywood. A version performed by Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies and later by Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version in When My Baby Smiles At Me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler performed for the Lux Radio Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, MacMurray and Lombard are doing very well, the story takes place in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpet player. Note a beautiful performance by Dorothy Lamour in the role of the Latin fox between Fred and Carole. Anthony Quinn is also featured in one of his first films as Wolf for Lombard. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low is doing really well today and I would not be surprised to see another version of burlesque for the twenty-first century.
