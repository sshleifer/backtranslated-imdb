That's what I feel for the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in reruns in 2001. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the show but there were too many flaws. <br /> <br /> I HATE CHARACTERS FROM MICHELLE & JOEY! <br /> <br /> Steal stories from old TV shows. They even stole from "The Partirdge Family". Then, in 1 episode "The family of Partridges" was mentioned. <br /> <br /> Actors playing different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn is the best-known player who did this, especially when she played in 1 episode. <br /> <br /> Michelle's character could not take a joke, but they then asked this little girl to "get back" from her sisters for a joke of them on her. <br /> <br /> The stories that came and went in 1 episode. Joey got the TV show with Frankie & Annette, we never heard about it again after that. Danny all of a sudden playing the guitar. 1 episode, he is a football coach, 1 episode, he is a softball / baseball coach. 1 game and you're out eh Danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse and Joey continue to get REALLY FAST jobs without experience. Only in a TV show. <br /> <br /> I loved the D.J. & St√©phanie characters. Wish Jodie Sweetin could learn from Candace Cameron Bure & have a NON-drugged adult life.
