This truly funny movie has a plethora of wacky characters, just about every voluptuous middle-aged Hollywood woman and a touching and funny love story. Capomezza and Malacici are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood of New York. They are also at opposite ends of the ladder of taste. Their children play the main roles of a religious production of Romeo and Juliet. Naturally, they fall in love. On the scene! The chaos and confusion that this causes, as parents argue with their children, are playing for us in the context of the beautifully insipid house of the Capomezza and their beautifully tasteless catering marriages. <br /> <br /> In addition to the four exorbitant parents and charming young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a simple-speaking grandmother, a lady who wavers a wand and conveys the spiritual guidance she receives a medium called The Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds shaped like a car back seat and two doves. There is no gag or punch that does not click in this fast paced movie. <br /> <br /> Even family names of both families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low eyebrows" and "Malacici" could mean "glued snobs". <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, this film may not please you. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all the women in this film make Martha Stewart look like Bette Midler. The rest of us should love it!
