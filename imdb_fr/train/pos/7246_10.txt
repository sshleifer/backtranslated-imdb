This film is completely ridiculous. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrible. The special effects are asin and the entire film takes place in a post-apocalyptic desert. Yet this is by far the most fun movie ever allowed to be produced. It's 101 minutes of laughter because we all know there will be no gasoline in the year 3000, nor any other El Camino. There are other aspects that I will not ruin, simply because they are what makes movies so wonderfully stupid. I highly recommend this movie, just because of its total idiocy. I do not know who would look at this as a high quality item, but if you want to laugh, look at Exterminators of the Year 3000!
