I rented this movie when it came out on a videotape and I really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and have watched it many times since. I would agree with others when they said that Indian Summer was a nostalgic film. When I look at it, I wish I could be 10-14 years old again. I think that's why we all love the film to some extent. We all wish at times to be able to relive our children's lives with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Would not it be nice if all your friends / parents are young again? Do not have to worry about work, being a parent, etc. I know I would like to jump into a Lorean and go back in time. Although I loved the movie, my favorite movie at the camp is Meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish they could make a version of the Indian summer of this.
