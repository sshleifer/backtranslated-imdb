Love Crimes by Lizzie Borden is an important film that deals with the dark side of female sexuality (and includes frontal female nudity, which beats the male gender). He flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with the kidnappers' theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of female libido is sometimes superficial and jerky, but Borden far exceeded the feminist dogma that took power through its insatiable desire. <br /> <br /> A striking scene exposes the female fetish of the horse, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, seduces an elderly woman wearing a pair of panties by asking her to show how she rides. He shoves a whip between his legs and presses against his crotch, which greatly increases his excitement. <br /> <br /> Then, suddenly, he leaves her and swears abjectly before the closed door. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays the role of the scammer. Although he walks away from beauty, he attacks Janes and has enough presence on the screen to make him believe that women could swallow his line. According to all reports, Sean Young proves a strange person, and she is hardly beautiful. Yet, in this film, as a prosecutor, his intense face, his slender body, his accentuated hips and his periodically disjointed movements turn into erotic fascination. His performance is impactful and complex. <br /> <br /> Borden has an intriguing view of the world and the fact that she is so at odds with the thoughtless climate scientist that I really appreciate.
