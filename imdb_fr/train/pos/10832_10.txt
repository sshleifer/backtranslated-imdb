If you like Deep Purple, you'll enjoy this great movie with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about the 70's most famous rock band, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be a lot of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to watch it.
