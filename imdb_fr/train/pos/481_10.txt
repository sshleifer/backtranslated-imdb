This is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are excellent. This may be because Gorris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a point of view on Luzhin which makes him more worthy of Nabokov's. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the film I do not like is Valentinov's influence on Luzhin's destiny. I can not imagine that Nabokov creates a person like Valentinov and gives him so much influence on the novel's argument.
