I did not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30-minute version could be abbreviated. I'm curious to know this myself because the last parts of the movie just did not make much sense to me, even when I looked at them again. 30 minutes, it seems really short for a film in 1917 too. "Poor Little Rich Girl", the next film of Tourneur, lasts 65 minutes and "Pride of the Clan", his previous feature, lasts 84 minutes. So I'm relieved to see that I was not crazy. It must miss part of this film and that's why the resolution does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to review or comment on a movie you can only see half of ... but I would recommend this movie anyway because of the really fascinating view it we offer on the interiors of a movie studio on the east coast of the time. This is the first film I have personally seen and which is based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star portrayed by Robert Warwick, who was later a leading actor of the Hollywood character and appeared in almost every film of Preston Sturges. He plays a Western actor perhaps vaguely inspired by William S. Hart, whom Warwick looks a bit like. After the really fascinating sequences taking place in the studio, we see them on a shoot where he discovers a peasant girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that goes very badly. After that, the film seems to lack major pieces in the form we have now. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the film's story for documentary value, but in the form having it does not hold much like a movie and is not particularly good example of the work of Maurice Tourneur.
