We will continue to admire more and more easily 9 out of 10 for a film of the director. But do not watch this movie hoping to be "entertained". Ang Lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the civil war. What is beautiful in the film, as in all Lee's films, is that he does not "fit" with his characters. He creates characters, embodies them with life, problems and ambiguity ... and gives them a reality that often strikes a lot closer to home than many of them are comfortable with. This film has some action, but it is not intended for those who love the action because the violence is deeply troubling and far from being gratuitous ... that is to say like the characters, it is real. And as you can imagine in one of humanity's most horrible wars, the violence is horrible. <br /> <br /> But as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely reigned in the civil war, it is a masterpiece. Was the war about slavery and abolitionism? Lee seems quite willing to blur this line made so popular in representations like blue and gray. Nor on idealism, however, as seen in Gone with the Wind. It's about freedom, the desire to have something that belongs to you and to fight for it. Looking at the characters, you will wonder "how can they fight to preserve slavery?" The fact is, I do not think they really are and the film shows the problem of why so many people were caught in the whirlwind of civil war. <br /> <br /> The fact seems that many of the characters we discover, they fight in a spirit of loyalty to their country, although they may have never considered what represents the country or if they really marry his values. The scenes of letters are very moving and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty pushed to the extreme. And when the tension finally dissipates and these characters suddenly find themselves "free" ... we are witnessing the birth of new men. <br /> <br /> All this is mixed with Lee's magnificent incorporation into the environment of humanity with breathtaking panoramas and frames. Lee has a style that is his, somewhat European, in his "art" (a slow camera, not disconcerted), Asian in his epic and in the development of his story, and yet familiar and easily accessible to many North Americans. /> <br /> Relax, give up your preconceptions about the civil war, the "western" genre, the war movie ... and let Ang Lee take you to such a fragile world So hard, so real that little of us can see it comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he accomplished in Ice Storm. Once again, the film is slow and without seeming "direction" ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to lead without "imposing" on the story or screen. His direction is amplified by what he does to Jewel (yes, the singer), an actress hitherto unproven who achieves an incredible performance. <br /> <br /> A film for those who love cinema and who are not in love with the standard Hollywood epic.
