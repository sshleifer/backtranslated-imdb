I have never watched the show "Next Action Hero" and, until reading the other reviews here, I did not know that this movie was the "prize" of this competition. I was changing channels and I came across this story. I found myself watching, daring impatiently, to the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was made (the most dangerous game, etc.), but I was hoping and had almost received the "gotcha" - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter at the end. I think the advanced technology was excessive (GPS) and gave me Night Rider flashbacks, but it was still not too excessive. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (suspension of disbelief) that was required of the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could throw countless grenades on a public bridge and NO COPS would come forward to investigate? Could a limousine make countless donuts at an intersection in Las Vegas and NO COPS would not show up? Pleeease. Too much of that sort of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thanks a lot. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the end was disappointing, with a taste after a bad episode of Star Trek. At least I now understand why the acting was so nerdy - with the exception of Zane, who does not work as much as he deserves in my humble opinion from me, they were the winners of a TV show. reality show. <br /> <br /> Challenge me.
