Several posters cited Renoir expressing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is that we could not all, while the harsh reality is that only a few privileged have the right to do so. At this stage of his career, Bergman could not be arrested. In 1949, she left Hollywood to take a picture in Europe. She fell under the director Roberto Rossellini and never waited for the future. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but in the year, after doing this for Renoir, she was back at her place of residence and with an Oscar for Anastasia. This is one of the three films that Renoir shot in color at the time. In short, it's better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and even speaks of French Can Can. Renoir probably thought that so much suited him, Bergman could get by with two prominent wooden men and Renoir chose two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, both in solid mahogany. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history but Renoir is content to give it a light look and focus on the reproduction of his father's paintings, mounted after climbs. In pastel colors, it looks like another film of the time The Grandes Manouvres, which is not a bad thing. Overall, this remains a nice trifle featuring a beautiful and charismatic actress.
