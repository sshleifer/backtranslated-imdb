Throughout this movie, you might think that this movie is just for kids. Well, it is mainly directed towards them, but it is also sufficiently complete with the jokes also directed towards adults in the audience. This time, the Muppet group is trying to reach Broadway, which prevents them from being produced, which leads them to separate. But Kermit will not stop, and his determination continues to move things forward until, once the agreement is reached, he is hit by a car and sent into amnesia! <br /> <br /> It's a part of these old 40s vehicles with musicals, the subject of a musical, but here there is a lot of madness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot hysterically amusing moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish, Gonzo's waterfalls, the murmuring campaign, among others), but also with a lot of heart. The Muppet authors are not bothered by conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to a point where it is almost refreshing to see such a story of "let me do a show" where, by dint of thinking, the characters will meet their dream. <br /> <br /> Although it does not have a scope as original as the movie Muppet, it contains many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations throughout Manhattan and even some intonations of interspecies encounters (and wedding)! The cameos include Liza Minneli ("a frog?"), Elliot Gould (as a policeman), Brooke Shields (proposed by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing or have a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes, romantic) moments with one of Muppet's best movies.
