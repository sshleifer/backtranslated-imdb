Ying, a Czech speaking Czech, invited us to screen a Czech film (subtitled in English) at the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotáři (Loners, 2000) and it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> As in many other Czech films, the seven main characters seem to lead a rather difficult and dirty life; Internet indicates that this theme was popular among American films in the early 90's. Their relationships separate, combine and recombine. Another typical feature of Czech films is that none of the characters are designed to be universally negative and that one of them is not a permanently positive character either. You can also see how the characters judge the characteristics of others according to the context. This is a very realistic characteristic of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters. Nevertheless, you learn that he only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessed with the weather that he disguises himself as a plumber to visit Hanka's parents - a house he has torched several times. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Hanka has a very heterogeneous relationship with her parents. She simply decides - by throwing a coin - to break up with Petr who works in a private radio station. Hanka does not see the middle-class life of her parents as a good example, but seems rather unable to create a better environment. But she is a very flexible figure, as far as the type of her boyfriend is concerned. <br /> <br /> For a moment, Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub, an innocent drug addict whose memory seems rather devastated. by drugs. However, the friends of his group inform Jakub that he already has another girlfriend. Hanka is disappointed and goes back to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr separate, the ceremony is organized by Robert, a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of the ordinary Czech citizen. people to Japanese tourists. Robert - who also supplies marijuana to Jakub - is never serious and sleeps with many women; finally, his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways of dealing with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (Slavic word of the word "spring") who arrived in Prague from Macedonia works as a barmaid - and you will not know if she came to Czechia to see her father or UFOs . It seems pretty confusing, but sometimes helps other characters to solve their problems. <br /> <br /> Petr works on the radio and is the only one who loves his job - a job he ends up losing. He announces to his audience that he has broken up with Hanka - this is how Ondřej learns what makes him very happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, his wife, Lenka, is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage - even after Onrej has asked a magician to kill him so that Onrej can try to capture Hanka again. (The wizard pays his debt because he is the brother of a victim of a major car accident - Jakub and Hanka bring him to the hospital and Ondřej saves his life.) Lenka also works for the agency travel - as a translator - and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for about twenty Japanese tourists who shoot their movies during Hanka's parents' dinner. <br /> <br /> The seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways, which would be natural if Prague was smaller by four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it seems unlikely that all these events will take place in seven people, but it's fun.
