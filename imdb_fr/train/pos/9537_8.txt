Some may think that the note I just gave is a little generous, but for this film, I think that the directors have done a good job with what they had, it is also a movie a film of acquired taste! <br /> <br /> my immediate thought was the direct connection with the classic cult movie "The Thing", that is to say the extraterrestrial parasites of outer space, infesting the human host for then cause havoc whenever possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this movie pays homage to such a movie and to others of the horror / bloody genre, even if it cleverly retains its own originality, these things argue for one, then continue to feed then become rivals! Only kill and choose a human when he needs a new host! Then choose another fight with another infected host! And this film even throws in a love story, but I will not say more, otherwise it gives too much. <br /> <br /> BIG! But as I said of an acquired taste, so do not be surprised if you do not like the movie. It's a small budget and yes, it's bloodthirsty, with the creatures / extraterrestrials / things that turn into coarse weapon members, that is, saws, drills, blades, and even imperfect weapon for all, except to decimate their opponent. I found myself exhausted by what I saw but at the same time glued to the screen asking me what would happen next! <br /> <br /> So if you like Gore, you like aliens, you like fighting and maybe even a little love thrown somewhere, so I have to recommend this movie as a must. I just wish I came across this sooner so I did it!
