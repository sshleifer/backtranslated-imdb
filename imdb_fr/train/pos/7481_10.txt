I totally agree with the following quote: "This is one of the best movies ever made". If you think Vanilla Sky is just a "redesign", you can not go far wrong. This film has incredible depth: visually, musically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at the same time (first scenes with Sofia) and sometimes powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climax scenes). <br /> <br /> The music and the sounds are perfectly related to this film. Without music, the story is half told. For the film, Nancy Wilson has created an emotional and eclectic score, which could not be better suited to such a dreamlike theme (although I was never published, I was able to get my hands on the original score at a price of about $ 60. If you look closely, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, The Monkees, etc., are also perfect for the film (Crowe has the ear for great music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes of this film (ie Love, Sadness, Regret) are very powerful and are magnified by the visual and musical experience, as well as by the ingenious dialogue; I recognize that the elevator scene makes me cry tears many times. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film though is (as if it could get better) is that it is so cleverly designed When you see the movie, you'll catch something new - then watch him carefully and get ready to think! Of course, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more in the story than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and overall, a brilliant job. Much of my cinematic and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It really touched my life, as true art does. It continually surprises me that there are many people who can not appreciate this film for what it is (I guess to understand that true art is an art in itself). <br /> <br /> In summary: Vanilla Sky is part of the league own.
