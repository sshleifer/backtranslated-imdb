Like most other commentators, I saw this film for the first time (on television, never on the big screen), while I was a teenager. My father has always held this film in high esteem and recommended it to me at that time. I must say that he was not only right, but that he had been with me forever for more than two decades than I had seen him for the first time. I saw her two or three more times since then (just a few days ago, I gave her another watch) and she has not lost any of her impact over time. It's always a great movie that is worth seeing! Manr believes that Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY is one of the first and best later Westerns, which had a realistic look at life in the Old West, but the barely-known LAST HUNT film is undoubtedly the best film and the most had even been half a dozen years ago. In fact, he was probably 3 decades ahead of his time, or maybe he's still ... <br /> <br /> Although I've thought a lot and certainly seen hundreds of western (I like this genre), I do not remember any western such as dark and depressive as this one. Two men tied together, partly out of hatred, partly by not seeming to have any other choice, surrounded by beautiful Mrs. Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian, leading the life of buffalo murderers until the fate is reserved for them. <br /> <br /> Nobody who has ever seen this film will be able to forget its end and the last images of this jewel. When the camera moves away from Mr. Taylor, a white buffalo skin appears (on a tree) and the echoes of the past, when all the hate has begun, are again present. Mr. Taylor had his buffalo, but eventually the buffalo got it. <br /> <br /> Apart from the best performances of each, the intelligent scenario and the good dialogue, it should also be mentioned that THE LAST HUNT is superbly photographed, I rarely saw a western that turned out well (except of those directed by Anthony Mann, who are all superbly photographed), that all the places are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack matches the picture very well. <br /> <br /> And the director BROOKS is really a superb storyteller. . He has done a lot of great films and has been successful in almost every genre imaginable, but even in a career as prolific as this one, THE LAST HUNT remains one of the best, if not the best. <br /> <br /> undoubtedly deserves a higher rating, compared to version 7 or higher of RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.
