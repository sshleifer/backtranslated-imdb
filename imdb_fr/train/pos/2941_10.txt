It's the ultimate one-man show in which Eddie Murphy is at his best. Forget Professor Nutty and distinguished gentlemen, it's the real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (claiming to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are killers. I think it's also daring enough to make fun of the artists who were really popular at that time. My favorite number is where he participates in his annual barbecue with the family and plays his drunk father and aunt Bunny who falls from the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel depressed! If you look at the 'Raw' suite, do not be disappointed. It's pretty good too but does not match "Delirious".
