In fact, Goldie Hawn comes from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I move away from the subject. This is a kind of Mr. Smith movie in Washington, with some variations but the same principle. I filmed this film years ago because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is highly unlikely that a cocktail waitress will get a big job in government just because she saved the life of a big gunman. It made me laugh and drove me crazy at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she was in were so ridiculous that I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER BEFORE). It drove me crazy to think that our government would train an average citizen the way it was formed. And the speech she made at the end ... beautiful. Too bad few people have guts like that in real life.
