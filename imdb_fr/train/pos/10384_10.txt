Almost 30 years later, I remember that this original PBS film was almost as tender as ever. Periodically, I check here at IMDb hoping that someone had the good sense to buy the rights and place them on a DVD. We are in September 2004, and I still hope - a deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two main actors started a small career, mainly in the soap opera of a prime time evening; the other, Frances Lee McCain, was seen in small roles here and there for a few years. But none of what they did before or after never corresponded to this little film that was produced, if I remember correctly, on an ephemeral series of PBS that presented original scenarios of new and future authors. <br /> <br /> I watched it every time it was broadcast on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. It was before the era of video recorders, so I have no record of it, except in my mind. <br /> <br /> In addition to the 31/12/2006: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD on ladyslipper.org. I understand that DVDs are etched from the author's personal copy.
