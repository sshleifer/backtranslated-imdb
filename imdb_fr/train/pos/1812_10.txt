It's one of the greatest movies of all time, maybe even the greatest movie of all time. I had forgotten the movie for about 12 years. Until I see a TV ad for ADGTH and it reminds me of good memories when I watched TV when I was little. And when I watched it a few nights ago, I became addicted to the movie. Usually, I do not like animated family movies, but this one is special, it's the ideal family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the film always touches my heart and saddens me a lot, but that's what makes this incredible movie better than any garbage coming out for kids' movies today. I mean the film is rated G and it's about 2 dogs playing the game, there's a lot of smoking, drinking, killing, death and hell described in the movie . What I believe makes the film from good to excellent. I mean, today's movies do not bring reality to children and what they did in this movie. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
