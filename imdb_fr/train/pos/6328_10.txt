It is so rewarding to see a great work of art transformed into another without distortion or artifice. I did not know how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a movie worth seeing. If you liked Bulgakov's book, you would fear, of course, to see a misinterpretation be made more for an art film project than to bring the deeper meaning of the story to the screen. There are some examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves nothing behind. It is as if the filmmaker read Bulgakov's work in the same way that a conductor reads a score - without leaving a note. Why can not we find such talent here in the United States? So now, my favorite book and movie have the same title.
