Critically, people say that Ant is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's life a little bit more. I do not remember a Pixar animation, except for the two Toy Story movies, which I laughed so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. The voiceovers are what makes this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant who is very bored. Hopper is a superb description of the always formidable Kevin Spacey, just like Haydn Panettiere as Dot. Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn also gave their support, and I could go on and on. The scenario is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. Antz's social messages are missing, but what we have is solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
