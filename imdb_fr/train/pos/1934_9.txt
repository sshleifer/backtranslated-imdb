I saw The Big Bad Swim at the Temecula Film Festival in 2006 and was totally surprised by my attraction. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the life of a group of people taking an adult. swimming lessons for various reasons. A humorous idea in itself, the course serves as a catalyst for greater change in students' lives. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the movie is how real it was. Rarely in the sets, the characters are so well treated. I loved the scenes of the class and the drama that took place outside was very poignant. Nothing seemed to be out of place or out of place, and in the end it left a very strong feeling, like going to school or summer camp - finding quick friends, building strong bonds and making discoveries about you- same, but leave too early. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that Paula's character has a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than what was finally revealed. I guess you will not meet everyone in class, however ... <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I found the movie very complete and very enjoyable. See if you have the opportunity.
