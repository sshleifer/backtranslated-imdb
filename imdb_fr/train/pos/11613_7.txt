Distortion is a movie that surprised me a bit. A sort of multi-level drama that features a man writing a play about his experiences of life happening to him right now. To be more concise, he feels that his wife is cheating on him, so he engages a private eye to search him. His wife has no idea what's going on. Meanwhile, the actors in this room also have some idiots who screw up their heads laughing with each other and with, we say, unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. All of this results in a theater where all actors are present and what is predictable (but not really) occurs. <br /> <br /> The director of the piece really gets things done with the character group, and goes up It's a fun movie actually, a movie that did not bother me and that I would recommend to people to check .
