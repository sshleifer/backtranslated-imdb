Boys work outside a recording studio when they hear "the voice of an angel". It would be Miss Van Doren, auditioning and calling herself Miss Andrews because her father does not approve of her being a "radio singer". However, she hopes that some big wig, Mrs. Bixby, a friend of her father, will hire him, and he will then have to give his approval. <br /> <br /> She leaves, but a few minutes later, the boys run Amok into the studio causing havoc and having other musicians to kill them after ruining the recording session. Finally, things calm down. "Whew, we escaped them," said Moe. "Yes, we escaped too," Curly replies. <br /> <br /> The boys then have fun in the studio, put the record of Miss Van Doren and Curly dresses as a woman and pretends to sing. Mrs Bixby enters, is impressed and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For $ 500 more, she was invited to sing at their high society party that night. The rest, as they say, is history since Curly claims to be an opera singer with fun results. Oh, by the way, he is accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> What's going on at the party is simply that the truth prevails, but not before some frosty antics occur. In all, a very good episode. I liked it but I would not say anything special.
