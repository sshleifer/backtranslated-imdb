Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own advice section that will probably be syndicated. After the death of his wife, he took the time to raise his daughters. Having had no love affair for some time, nothing prepares him for the meeting with the radiant Marie, in a local bookstore located in a small town in the ocean, on the island of Rhode, where he went to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After having loved Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the magnificent woman presents herself to the enclosure of the family. After all, she's the date of Dan's brother, Mitch. <br /> <br /> It's clear from the start that Dan and Marie are made for each other, and although we felt what was coming, we're aiming for the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants give us. Mr. Hedges, author and independent screenwriter, gave us two excellent novels, "What's Eating Gilber Grapes," and "An Ocean in Iowa," as well as the delightful independent film "Pieces of April," which he also directed. It's a coincidence that both films are about families at Thanksgiving reunions. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the movie was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. He recalls, in many ways, Jack Lemmon, who interprets in a serious and comical manner, what can be said about Ms. Binoche, intelligent actress, and a brilliant presence in any film. she is well prepared to make comedy and to convince us of her Mary. <br /> <br /> John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing to do, they simply serve as accessory music for decoration. Dane Cook, who is seen The brother of Mitch, is better because he recites more replicas than the others. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a delightful movie that will please everyone.
