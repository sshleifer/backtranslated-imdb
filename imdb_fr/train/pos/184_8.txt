Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (as Billy Boone) are people like "Show People". My introduction to Ms. Davies was an "excerpt" from this film; the delicious parody in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was watching this film, right now; however, it is possible that I saw him in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression, when he joins Davies for a curatorial meal - throwing his hat on the ring with some wonders at the table. Indeed, Haines and Davies offer superb comic performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the departure of Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), his daughter Davies, to Hollywood. She is confident that she will become the new sensation of Tinseltown. Indeed, Davies and the Haines already arrived become stars of the comedy. But Davies aspires to become a true queen of the drama. Davies leaves Haines and joins Paul Ralli. But, the public prefers Davies in more comical roles; maybe the director King Vidor proposes a case of art imitating life? <br /> <br /> Lots of great pictures of Hollywood places, both on the set and off. Full of big "cameos"; Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart during a lunch in the studio at the celebrity table. The best "little" player, however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has the nerve to ask Davies for his autograph! Although cameos are fun, they, as well as episodic sequences, really help "Show People" become a less important film and an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines and Dell Henderson
