IN COLD BLOOD should be classified as a top-notch film, even if the subject matter is about as dark as possible in the world of pretense, but film fans must absolutely find that it is very attractive , based on a real criminal frenzy. <br /> <br /> It starts with the music of Quincy Jones in the credits and striking views on a bus to Kansas City, creating the climate of the film. even before the end of the credits. The black-and-white photography of Conrad Hall does a superb job right from the start. <br /> <br /> Clearly as clearly from the beginning: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are naturally born actors. They do a great job in describing free-spirited buddies looking for the next thrill. "Have you ever seen a millionaire fry in electric hair?" "No, there are two types of rules in this world - one for the rich and one for the poor," said Wilson, taking a sip of drunk driving. . <BR /> <br /> Both are meant to cross the path of a farming family, showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind. <br /> <br /> Blake, remembering the history of cinema and considering looking for gold in Mexico, said: "Do you remember Bogart in 'The Sierra Madre Treasure'?" (An ironic moment, because Blake himself was in the movie as a little boy selling lottery tickets). "I assigned you as a natural killer," Wilson told Blake. <br /> <br /> JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the main detectives in the case, discovering that the four family members were tied up, shot in the head. and one had his throat cut. "Do not people here lock the doors?" asks PAUL STEWART. "They'll do it tonight," sums up the terse answer. <br /> <br /> After the murders, the killers discover that there was "no safe in the wall", as told by their informant. So, in the end, it was really a stupid and insane crime. The question is: WHY did they do it? And it's something that the second half of the film explores in depth. It takes about an hour and a half for the detectives to find the killers and begin the interrogation. <br /> <br /> It is these final scenes that arouse the most conviction and interest, because boys are said to have made many mistakes and left a living witness. Actual events up to and including murder are saved until the end. "That makes no sense," Blake told Forsythe. "Mr. Cutter was a very kind gentleman, I thought so until I slit his throat." Richard Brooks' script is concise and straightforward, as is his direction. <br /> <br /> In summary: Brilliant representation of two young men aimlessly subject to criminal madness that made no sense then or now for a mere $ 43.
