This is the best series of this type I've seen all year. I can not help but think it's just my chance: a series that I love counts 6 episodes (and more next year) and the endless stream of detective crime series turns into episodes unending. <br /> The reasons why New Tricks succeeds are numerous. The scripts are good and the mix of characters superb. The acting is first rate, and the mix of comedy and drama works perfectly. The stories are not all memorable, but that's not why I watch shows like this. <br /> <br /> The theme song is a favorite and we were disappointed that it is not available in any published edition. Good things, BBC - a triumph of meaning about sex appeal (aside from the young police officer, no one is so stupid, and even if he IS, he can still act!).
