"One-Round" Jack Sander is so called because he is a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. If they can last a lap, they win a prize - a popular way to attract customers to long-running shows. Mabel is in love with the box office, Mabel, although her head is spinning quickly as Bob Corby enters the ring to try his luck with Jack. What no one in the fight knows is that Bob is the champion, so he is able to beat Jack - even if it takes him to work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his partner and abandon the carnival circuit. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a real boxer. Slowly, he climbed the ladder until he was almost ready to face the Field. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Field and Mabel start running behind Jack's back, even though Mabel is married now. Jack. So when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance? Plug in and see. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and, although today, this kind of film seems strange to a director known for his thrillers, in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed kind. he directed or wrote (he did both for this film). In fact, in many ways, this movie is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, as a somewhat similar plot was evoked in one of his upcoming silents, THE MANXMAN (also starring Carl Brisson as the husband injured). So while it sounds a lot like a classic boxing movie of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director - even with his rather formulated ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, although a little predictable and that Ian Hunter plays a boxing champion seems ridiculous, the film works well. Although it is far from a perfect silence, it is worth the detour and offers a good punch.
