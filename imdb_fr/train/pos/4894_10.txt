I grew up when the music of this movie was popular. What a wonderful time for music and dance! The only complaint I would make is that I was a bit too young to go to the USO and the discos. It looks like I live in the past (I have wonderful memories) so what's wrong with that? !!? The Second World War was a terrible time, except for music. The death of Glenn Miller has been a terrible sadness for us. This film will be one of my favorites. Clio Wool was excellent; what a voice! I do not know how I missed this movie. The main reason for this comment is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to rap and new age, which offends me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
