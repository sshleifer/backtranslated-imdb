After riding a bike that day, lying on the edge of a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood, this film tells me absolutely made sense. <p> The image of the film was beautiful and that's all you need. Turn off the conscious mind control knob and work done. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of Baraka (1992), but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph. <br /> <br /> This comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines is the minimum, not nine lines but ten. Once you have finished counting all the lines, you realize that there are less than ten, whereas less than ten lines suffice to make my comment.
