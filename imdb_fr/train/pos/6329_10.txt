The cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is great, especially acting: it is beyond praise. The film, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the most brilliant symbol of Razrukha (a familiar Russian word for "devastation", often meaning the period of chaos in the way of life after the 1918-19 war) - the big open dirty door in the brick wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the black hole in the door behind her. <br /> <br /> Now, the film is released on DVD with the image fully restored and the 5.1 sound, there are well translated English subtitles as well, although some obscene words of Sharikov have been replaced by the softer versions of the translation. I do not know if this DVD is available abroad, but if you find it, it is really worth watching. <br /> <br /> And, to conclude, a fact: about 50% of Russians today, mainly young people, can be identified as Sharikov to a great extent. This is the post-Soviet effect: the Soviets did not seem at all prepared for the informational attack of Western civilization. Producers and directors of television and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media unbelievably aggressive, soulless and thoughtless, so that they encourage the darkest. instincts of each Russian. Even among Internet users, one-third of people use obscene language in forums and discussions, as it is surprisingly common in familiar speeches.
