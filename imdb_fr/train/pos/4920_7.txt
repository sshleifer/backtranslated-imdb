No, not really, but it's really a very good movie and it's unfortunately a forgotten jewel. Black and white suits the film. <br /> <br /> Simple formula, a guy was touched by the plague and the authorities had to find all the people he had contacted before dying. <br /> <br /> Very well directed and the acting is awesome. Richard Widmark as a men's leader is good, but he is completely outclassed by Paul Douglas as captain of the police, and Jack Palance (never better than this one) and Zero Mostel as villains. Unfortunately, Palance continued to play similar characters in gangster movies or second-rate war.
