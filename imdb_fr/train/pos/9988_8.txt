What I liked about the screen adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it remained so faithful to the novel! A good film! As an avid reader, I find that the worst of film adaptations is that the book gets lost in translation. You can say that the Stone Angel team took care not to let this happen with this movie. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) who chose to play Hagar in her youth has also done an incredible job that deserves praise. I have not seen any of Horne's previous works, but I will certainly look for him after attending his interpretation of Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> I heard that The Stone Angel's Canadian theatrical release was going to take place in the spring or summer. 2008. I can not wait to see him again on the big screen!
