"Dance, Fools, Dance" is one of Crawford-Gable's first vehicles from 1931. Crawford plays Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life is to party, drink and undress to jump out a yacht and go for a swim. All of this ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) without money. Bonnie works for a newspaper under the name of Mary Smith; his brother will work for the bootleggers. The chief man is Jake Luva - described by Clark Gable while he is still playing another crook. Later, of course, he would become a romantic hero, but in the early 1930s, MGM used him as a villain. Not realizing her brother was involved in illegal activities, Bonnie moved closer to Luva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford formed a great team. Her facial expressions are a bit wild, but that, along with her dancing, is one of the things that make the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as Bert. <br /> <br /> It's always interesting to see the precoded movies, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
