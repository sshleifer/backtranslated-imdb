These childhood memories ... when things were new and we were full of curiosity for the world around us; as we took those first steps in the long journey we call life. <br /> <br /> One of my first memories of my childhood is this animated program "Galaxy Express 999", about a young boy named Tetsuro, who went on a train ride around the galaxy , hoping to win a mechanical body to avenge the foolish death of his mother in the hands of mechanical hunters recovering cold-hearted trophies. Maetel accompanies Tetsuro in her journey, a woman of exquisite and golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost many years ago ... <br /> <br /> Back in the early 80s While he was kindergarten child "Galaxy Express 999" was an extremely popular animated program imported from Japan, inspiring young boys who dreamed of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and thrilling journey through life. was waiting for them. Memories of having listened to this animated program on weekdays between 8pm and 9pm before going to bed ... <br /> <br /> It was wonderful memories, never to have again ... <br /> <br /> While settling in America and living here for more than 20 years, I sometimes wondered about this place and time, in a country separated from America by a huge ocean, to thousands of kilometers from this extensive children's program, with his hit song and boy named Tetsuro, his protective mate, the enigmatic Maetel train conductor, and the Galaxy Express 999 space convoy. <br /> <br /> Several years have passed ... <br /> <br /> Last summer, while I was in Korea, I was able to find a copy of the original "Galaxy Express 999" (1979) DVD, which reminded me of many nostalgic and sincere memories.
