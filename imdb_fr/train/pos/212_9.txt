Just like the comedy duo of his title, "The Sunshine Boys" has become a forgotten classic, about 30 years later. It's hardly mentioned next to other major movie comedies of the 1970s. That makes no sense given the singular peculiarity of this film, perhaps the best that Neil Simon ever wrote. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, once a half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now bitter. A 73-year-old solo who can not find a job in a crisp advertisement. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is sure to be able to find work if Willy agrees to find his partner, Al Lewis (George Burns), for a celebration on the theme of the nostalgia of show business on ABC-TV . <br /> <br /> "Nostalgia" is what "Sunshine Boys" has to offer, from the beginning, when a series of 1920s movie clips featuring various artists from the past glitter in front of us accompanied by " Be A Clown "by Cole Porter. Then there is the film's current setting in Manhattan, where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound. Epochs collide in Willy's glorious mess in a Manhattan apartment, where pictures and cartoons of long-lost celebrities defy the walls under Zabar's tabloid headlines and empty groceries. If you were alive in the 1970s like me, you might even feel as if you were in this apartment. <br /> <br /> It's clear that Willy has been living there for too long. He sleeps in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is it?" Pause. "It does not matter, it's tea." <br /> <br /> The elderly living alone can be sad in every hand, but Simon's clever wit and unerring sense of character turn this 1972 film adaptation into a gold comedy. The most amazing thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is that it rubs your nose in Willy's almost existential condition without disturbing you at all. "89 years old and just like that, he does not die of anything," Willy said of an old friend composer, before deciding that the man was probably dead from writing a song that rhymed "lady" with "baby ". <br /> <br /> Burns won an Oscar for his understated rendition of Lewis, but it was Matthau who took it home, his makeup and his proud but disgusting face, which really boasted of you. idea that he was 73 years old when he realized that. Willy is odious to the extreme, he fully deserves the description of Ben as "a crazy old man", but you always look for him, taking advantage of his small victories even when they arrive at the price of the patience of others. His sentences also kill you, especially when he tries to kill Lewis, for whom the reunion on television proves to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You are no longer in contact!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm always in demand, I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room was on fire, you would not be hot," replies Lewis. <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Ross turns very casually and discreetly, with subdued lighting and medium shots, even in the most moving moments, to make way for comedy and the message zen grace of the film thanks to a silent acceptance. You never feel like you're watching a movie, one of the many charms of "The Sunshine Boys," and Ross's direction, like the Three Directors' Game, goes a long way toward achieving that goal. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult, especially when people watch life go by, but "The Sunshine Boys" suggests it's a pleasure, because for us it really is.
