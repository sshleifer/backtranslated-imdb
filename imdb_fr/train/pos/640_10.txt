my sister and I saw the first one last night ... it was so good we were stuck for the whole thing ... hahaha..i think i'm addicted to the season !! ... they have very good actors in this thing .. the guy from the head coach and the player who loves pete were very good and the plot has already had me but i do not really understand how they are going to keep him stretched for a whole season .. there will probably be big twist tho..i I can not wait for Tuesday .. finally Jeremy Sumpter who is he? I can say that he is going to be big !! he was so good that we immediately fell in love with his character .. I can not wait for the next episode .. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
