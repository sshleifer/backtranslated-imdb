"The Birth of the Beatles", an American TV movie released in the fall of 1979, has been the best film to date, telling the story of the four Liverpool boys who have revolutionized the music industry and the world. As said the point of view of former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of all the actors is excellent, but more particularly that of Stephen Mackenna in John Lennon and Rod Culbertson in Paul McCartney. The film was produced by legendary rock and roll legend Dick Clark. Who, a year earlier in 1978, had produced another TV movie, has stood the test of time with "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role of another musical legend; "ELVIS". This film was directed by an unknown director, "John Carpenter", who then directed other blockbuster films, such as; "Halloween", "Escape From New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said of the director of the "Birth of the Beatles", Richard Marquand. He then directed other theatrical blockbusters such as "The Return of the Jedi Star Wars", "The Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge", among others. The only other film that tells the story of the Fab Four that I know is Back Beat, who had a theatrical release in 1994. However the film did not interest him, any more than the public, because the film lifespan at the theatre. Birth of the Beatles is a very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the difficulties and difficulties they have gone through and which ends at their peak of success when they arrive in New York and appear at the Ed Sullivan show in 1964. I highly recommend this film.
