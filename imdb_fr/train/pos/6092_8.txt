The cult classics are almost impossible to predict. Who would have guessed that Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: A Space Oddysey, critically-directed films and audiences on their way out, would become immensely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a movie expert. Unlike the majority of those who hated Envy (as evidenced by a disappointing score of 4.4), I found Envy one of the funniest movies of the last decade. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is ridiculous. The dialogue is not intelligent, the scenes have little continuity and the script seems to have been written by a fourth leveler. But that's exactly why the movie is so hilarious. You see, to appreciate the accidental genius of Envy, you have to appreciate the film from a paradoxically detached point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I like Envy? Because the film is so bad that it becomes good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and Envy is perfect.
