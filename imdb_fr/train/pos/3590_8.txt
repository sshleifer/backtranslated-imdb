I had just seen this movie the other day when I rented it and I thought it would be another movie with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane joined boxing because she wanted it. I thought this movie was good. I gave him an 8/10. It's like it's good. Plus, a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even though she has been in just six years.
