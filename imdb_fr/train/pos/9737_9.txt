An incredible performance by Simon Pegg that gets better and better with each role. As usual, he plays the role of a very cringy character that sometimes gives you want to hide behind your cushion, which is embarrassing for him, but that's what Pegg is. <br /> <br /> each of them aimed at Penn. The film was very cleverly staged, in which each character plays a very sophisticated and serious role, Penn being the only humor involved, which is a great achievement from director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can not let this one go away. without a round of applause to Gilliam Anderson who shone all the way through. Highly recommended to all.
