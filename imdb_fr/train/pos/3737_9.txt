First of all, this movie was a crazy race from start to finish. The story of the training of soldiers who fight with their superiors and who eventually regroup. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end. It is a war drama that is worth visiting if you like the ceaseless (sometimes unrealistic) discussions and the horrors of what is training camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how the actors engaged in dialogue was sometimes amazing. and sometimes humorous. How does Bozz (Colin Farrel) deal with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the plot, the camp in Tigerland, and even his help? <br /> <br /> The innovative freehand shoot added some taste or flavor to the film. Constant movement, constant action and constant confusion. Sometimes it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, it was more and more realistic. Some of the film's points (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be a bit too realistic even if they added an effect to the movie that would not have been there without them. it was a very hard film, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's best films (if not his best performance). The acting was superb. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
