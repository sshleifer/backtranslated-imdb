I had no problem with the movie, which I thought was very good. It's the video of the LAPD crime scene that disturbed me. I wonder if Lion's Gate REALLY thought that viewers would want to see people brutally beaten to death. Sorry Lion's Gate, it was an absolutely incredible idea !!! <br /> <br /> To return to the film: the cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a rascal, abusing the women of his life (Lisa Kudrow for his wife, Kate Bosworth for his girlfriend) and he was desperately in the drug business. His connection with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that leads to the infamous murders of Wonderland. How much Holmes was involved in the killings? We may never know the whole truth about the story (Nash is still alive and is a free man), but the film still does a pretty good job.
