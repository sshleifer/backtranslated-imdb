Upon entering this film, I had heard good things about it. Leaving there, I was neither amazed nor disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character, like his other films. There was some laughter here and there - nothing too funny. My favorite part of the movie is probably when he dances in the club scene. I absolutely have to try this the next time I'm in a club. A few stars here and there, including Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, this X-Files girl and Jeff Bridges. I found it very amusing to see Thandie Newton make an appearance in a scene. She was of course in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a dramatic twist, either you will appreciate it to a certain extent, or you will find it a bit dull. I would add that Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this film. : 3
