Before watching it, a lot of things were going on against this film. <br /> <br /> First, I was a typical high school student, in a Shakespeare class that I did not even really like, and which was even less understood. half of! Shakespeare would be nothing more than untouched without me devoting all my concentration to his almost encrypted parts ... encrypted with his language extremely difficult to understand .... and then I still do not understand the essential. <br /> <Secondly, it was 4 hours! I never thought it could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you something. This film was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood the whole language as it was interpreted. Now, the script was followed to the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare's class. And now my mind opened and I understood it. I suspected watching the movie almost! But here ... when we do it, and only then, Shakespeare comes back to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is really a master who wrote great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the big budget movie style (with a nice cinematography and a photograph), and acted surprisingly by Brannagh and the cast, one way or another ... I understood what was happening. What was said The language is great and passionate. This allows for more raw emotion ... when words can not describe something, perhaps Shakespeare's words can too. <br /> <br /> I still want to date that Fist of The North Star (the English duo) is the best film ever made. No film provides more entertainment. But for a movie about to dethrone Fist from this position (what Hamlet did - he approached) is really amazing ... impressive. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more amazing, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Sensational. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the few REALLY powerful movies on the planet. <br /> <br /> Two hundred trillion stars come out of the infinite. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all the children who are taking a Shakespeare lesson ... forget that. You're wasting your time. You must see the plays played. Only then will justice be restored to them.
