Greetings again from the darkness. The twisted and much-anticipated comedy of writer / director Richard Shepard is an evening out for actor Pierce Brosnan. This guy from Bond is gone. This new guy is quite something else !! I read that Shepard thought that Brosnan was too good for that role of plum, but Brosnan turns out to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and is anything but pretty! Do not underestimate how twisted humor is in this one. If you go, expect hitting lines and gags about all types of sex, murder, religion, sports, business, and anything else you think is politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without sombrero) is a pleasure to behold. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the right guy from Brosnan's comic. Hope Davis plays a small, subtly supportive role as Kinnear's wife (who's called "Bean"?) And who gets a little upset when she has an animator in her living room. <br /> <br /> the visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, a race track and the suburbs of Denver. And how often do we have The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This one is certainly not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a little out of the box and you like making risky movies, maybe it's for you.
