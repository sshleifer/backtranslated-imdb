This film deals with the life of Queen Victoria in her youth and her early years as monarch of Britain. <br /> <br /> "The Young Victoria" has an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated to the smallest detail. The extravagant costumes, the sumptuous places and the beautiful landscaped gardens make "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most surprised by the thoughtful cinematography. The way each person is placed in relation to the background or the foreground is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene that struck me the most was when Victoria spoke with Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the middle of the doorway from the angle of Victoria, while under the angle of Melbourne, Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held her arm on her hips. <br /> <br /> Regarding history, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are precipitated or not explained. I was expecting a great coronation scene and unfortunately it only lasted a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a good movie, and it would have been even better if it had been longer. , so that events can be properly explained without haste.
