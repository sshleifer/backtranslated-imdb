I did not see this movie at the theater. I admit to having an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta doing movies? I remember the Oscar program that year. Travolta looked completely devastated when he did not win. How dare he, when there were "real" actors in the race? I'm sorry John, you should have won. After watching this film on cable a few years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wesley, everything is done wonderfully. I also admit never to miss when I channel the surf. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I learned to interact, dance with my thumbs in the belt and enjoy Travolta more. The only thing that disappointed me was the forgetting, on the soundtrack, of some of Urban Cowboy's music. "Looking for love" defines the film, but Urban Cowboy is full of classics that did not go to the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD ........
