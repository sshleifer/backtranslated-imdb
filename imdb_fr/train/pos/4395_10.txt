One of my favorite movies that has been neglected by too many spectators, an observation that mystifies me. Not only under the direction of the famous Ang Lee, it had many young actors who would become great stars, for example Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker. Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the actors were superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed a naughty villain who killed to kill him. <br /> <br /> When the director's biographies and achievements (even when he won an academic award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. I discovered the film on DVD by chance and it became one of my most watched movies. However, it is rarely seen on the cable. I can not wait to read what others suggest are the reasons why this movie is not well known.
