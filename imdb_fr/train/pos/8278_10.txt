If you want Scream or something like the big studio horror product that we've been forced from us these days, do not bother. This well written film made me think of everything he had to say. Importance of the myth in our lives to make sense of how children interpret the world (and the violence it contains), looting our environment and ignorance of its history and legends ... all here, but not to the surface. Technically, you could call it a "monster movie", even if the Wendigo does not physically take shape before the end. Then everything depends on you and your beliefs about what's going on with the legendary spirit / beast. Some standard thriller elements for those looking for only the basics and the movie never get bored, although in fact, the less creature you see, the better. Fessenden continues successfully George Romero's tradition of using gender as a parable and as a discussion forum while keeping us crawling.
