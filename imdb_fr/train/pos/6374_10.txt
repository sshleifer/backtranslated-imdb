Atlantis was much better than I expected. In some ways, his story was better than other older films. Although this film has sometimes required sustained attention. It was a good movie for all ages. I noticed that part of the young audience was expecting a comedy but had an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have only seen parodies. Shortly after, everyone seemed to look very closely at Atlantis.
