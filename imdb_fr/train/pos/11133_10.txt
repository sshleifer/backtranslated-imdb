Although I like this movie, I can hardly watch it, it is so real. So, I put it tonight and hid behind my computer bank. I remembered it very well, but I just wanted to see if I could find something that I had not seen before ........ I did not find it: it's because it's is so real to me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" writes the ages of the commentators should be shown with their resume. I'm all for that! It is quite obvious that most of the people who spoke about "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when it was released. They mention other films, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who appeared in, later. I will be just as outrageously frank: I am 82 years old. If you know some of my other comments, know that I was a professional imitator for 60 of those years and that I also appeared in a movie - you would never recognize me, even if you were familiar. with my nightclub character. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this movie? You bet that I do it !! .... <br /> <br /> .... and I do not feel ashamed at all. If you have not met a few, it's your loss - but you have a huge chance that you did not know. So many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters might surprise you. It should not be a secret. MANY actors / actresses have emerged from the origins of "Midnight Cowboy". Who should judge? I can name several current BIG-TIME stars who have been raised in the shabby streets of many cities and have not been damaged at all by the time they spent there. I do not judge, because they are human beings, as we all are: love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you call the attributes, they are all present, whatever the content of the packaging. <br /> <br /> The "question" about Hoffman begging in the streets to prove he could play the role of "Ratzo" is a gem - you can see him driving his car all around Los Angeles - how do you think you get his point of view? I can also name many male stars who have paraded through the streets and walked the bars to earn money. Although the nightclub in which I worked for the last time for 26 years is world famous and legitimate, I can also name some huge stars that were constantly being chased from our street, seeking to take stock. <br /> <br /> That should not be surprising today, even if it's definitely an action in Hollywood and other cities, big and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They feel no worse, because they have a different hue. <br /> <br /> Some "users" thought that "Joe Buck" had been assaulted by his grandmother. Although I saw him in bed with a boyfriend, I found no impact. Believe it or not, the kids did not ALWAYS have their own room - because it's a must today, it should tell you that something a little pervert can happen in the master bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have asked for money on the street, but some of the "users" pointed out that Jon Voight was not a major star on the "Midnight Cowboy" shoot - his actual salary would surprise you. I think it was stolen! Nobody can doubt the clarity he put in his role, nor the fact that he has made a star for such important work as "Deliverance". He defined a powerful man who had defeated his devils and was the best: few people commented that he was sodomized in this film. The late '60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been fashionable. <br /> <br /> I also did not find homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe". were clearly opposed, unattractive to each other. They found a much more pure relationship - a true friendship. If you did not understand that at the end of the movie, you lost your time. The confusion of "Joe", but unashamed devotion was obvious. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - a role John Wayne could never win and he was as handsome in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne had his Oscar. All the characters in this movie were beautifully defined - if you do not think they're still here, you're wrong. "The party" ? - attend some of the "raves" that young people attend ... if you can get in there. Watch the line of people trying to get into trendy clubs - you'll see all the scandalous personalities. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of the slender women in society who sometimes have to be discerning. If you were shocked by his brilliant acting, thinking that "it's not real", look at the "ladies" of today who live on the verge of discredit ... and who are admired for it. <br /> <br /> The brutality "Joe" displayed in the theft of the old man, unfortunately, is also part of life. You do not have to tolerate that, but it's not very different from any violence. "Joe" explicitly named his goal - in this situation, I would have put the money back faster than he had asked. This is one of the scenes that makes this film a breakthrough that I do not watch. My heart shattered for both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger must have been familiar with this sordidness to lead this revelation of breathtaking beauty - Waldo Salt did not write with foresight . Anyone who wanted to put it on the screen must have understood that he was making history and should be proud of his honesty. Perhaps we could turn a blind eye to unpleasant situations "only in America", while other filmmakers would not fail to present it to the public. Not looking does not mean he's not here - give me the truth every time. Bravo! to all......
