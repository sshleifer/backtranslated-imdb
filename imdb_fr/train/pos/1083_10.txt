Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A spectacle worthy of an Oscar, but once again shunned by the Academy. Mr. Grant goes from stupid to tender in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to leave the big city. The pitfalls of building a house are well described and have become the basis (approximately) of Tom Hanks' more modern vehicle, "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you like good old-fashioned comedy without curse or Free Sex, this movie is a must see.
