OK, so Soldier is neither deep nor meaningful like Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2, but overall, I found that very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell remained in his character does not speak and is not practically without emotion makes the moments when his humanity has pierced more and more poignantly. I found his portrayal of limited emotional development more touching than Arnie's in T movies (and before I get any comment, yes, I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human, but the advanced principles by the two movies were the same). <Br/> <br /> Thus, for the film itself, a reasonable American / British cast is able to give substance to this little story. I was not sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad guys or followers. He was therefore unable to decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic, neither a lost group of peaceful / gullible / cowardly followers who are being wiped out, nor a group of subversive aggressive paranoid terrorists toward strangers and others. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and unlike other reviews, I do not think it will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - the suites are such unstable creatures!) . Sean Pertwee really made the pride of his father, maintaining the noble family of science fiction. And the rest of the cast helped flesh out that pathetic group of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too well. <br /> <br /> If you see this in your television schedule, I recommend you give it a chance. . I do not think you will be disappointed.
