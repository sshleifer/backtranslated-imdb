My wife and I took our 13 year old son to see this movie and we were absolutely delighted with the fun of the movie. It has an added attraction for boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the movie and especially the Hallie Kate Eisenberg chorus, "The boys are so weird." It is heartening to see a film that shows in an exhilarating way that boys and girls are indeed emotionally and socially different. Boys really do this kind of strange thing and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mother! We enjoyed the film so much that my son and an 11 year old friend, myself and my daughters, the 23 year old boyfriend, went to see the movie the next day for a day with guys. We had more fun the second time and everyone was delighted. It's clean and deliciously played by a pre-teen cast that recalls the classic TV "Freaks and Geeks". We all feel that this film will become an incredible success, just like the "Freaks & Geeks" who did not survive their first season but sold their DVDs. Do not see it especially if you have boys and you will see that it stimulates the conversation about pleasure and safety! The girls will love it because of the opportunity it gives them to say, "The boys are so weird!" Do not miss it ...
