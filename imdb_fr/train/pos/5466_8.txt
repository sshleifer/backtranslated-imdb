Excellent pre-coded amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck, newly inspired (by the writings of Nietzsche!) To chase his sensibilities and exploit himself, use men to his advantage. This is not really fair to the German philosopher, but it is interesting to note that Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version does not do much but she behaves well here, always moving the film forward. Not as much flesh as one would expect, but many risky situations, jokes and innuendo astonishing. Very entertaining, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I honestly assume not a very attractive sight of the woman digging gold. Yet, it's life!
