As noted by other critics, this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others, I like the beginning of the film because it's like a fairly accurate description of what should be a trading post. In addition, the exhibition is necessary for us to know why Harry wants to return to the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and terrifying hunting sequences ever made. This happens when Harry's safari group has to overtake a tribe of cannibals. The production values ​​of pre-censorship add a lot of realism, truly describing the terrible dangers that Europeans were waiting for in the jungle. The film also offers, albeit perhaps formerly, a precise account of the horrible way in which white employers have treated indigenous Africans. In addition to sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, beautiful scenery and two chetas! Do not miss a classic adventure.
