I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings video after watching the live version of the movie FANTASTIC 2001. The trilogy of live action of the Lord of the Rings directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be much better than the trilogy George Lucas's "prequel" of Star Wars (Episodes 1-3) will never be like the real 21st century fantasy movie series! <Br/> <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child and I did not quite understand the depth of the movie at that time. Now that I've read the books, I understand what the story is all about. While some characters are pretty stupid (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars, first episode (AWFUL!)), But I must say that it follows the book very closely, and this is part of book two, The two towers. The good things are that the action is a bit interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for its time. The problem is that it ends abruptly halfway to The Two Towers without Frodo's attempt to destroy one of the rings to be successful, and the animation seems far out of step with current standards. . <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not as bad as many say. BUT, the 2001 version of the live action is the brand new Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which led him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever filmed. So we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi! I will take the animated version of Lord of the Rings instead of the live version of Harry Potter anytime! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, well LESS violent than the live version of 2001, but nowhere near as good! For fans of the books and film versions of The Lord of the Rings.
