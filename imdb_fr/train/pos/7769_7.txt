Lauren Bacall was living the illness and death of her husband, Humprey Bogarts, when she shot this film. Rock Hudson was almost at the peak of her 1950s celebrity. Dorothy Malone is in excellent shape and wins an Oscar for her support. Robert Stack is nominated and just falls for his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a little soapy from another time, but it's just as good as most dramas. Incredible how drunkards can lead in this film and the speed with which Stack plummets in the first sequences of the film. <br /> <br /> You can see why the cast is so good and if its production is real, this movie is fine. You can say that Bacall is distracted during this movie. Although her game is good, she seems emotionally exhausted in some sequences. <br /> <br /> The sexual references in this movie are so sweet that many of today's young viewers would not want it. realize what they are. The film does a good job of telling a story and actually leaves something to be done in the end although none has ever been done - although Written Beyond The Wind is a good title.
