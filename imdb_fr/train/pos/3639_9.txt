For me, this movie is about the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself, but for his family. I can not begin to tell you how I could tell my little girl that dad was going to Kansas City to cover the Holmes priest and the Kansas City Chiefs. She would think it's the coolest thing, like Morris's son. Living dreams with the family is the purpose of this one. I think that only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
