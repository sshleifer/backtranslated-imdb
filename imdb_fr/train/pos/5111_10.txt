Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T has driven? I look like a Ford from the 70s to the late 70s. This film is my favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. The support is interesting because it is similar to the first truck I drove and I found another recently. I would like to restore the pickup, I have to look like in the movie. Also, the music was great and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Did John also have a double for the stage on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang Debra W did she lead in this show. It looked like a 1960s model. Thanks,
