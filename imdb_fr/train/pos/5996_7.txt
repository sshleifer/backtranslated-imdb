Time and time again, I have said that if people do not want remakes or sequels, they should stop seeing them and venture into the independent film world. That said, the last time I saw an independent film, it must have been easy six months ago. So, here is a review for an independent film on which I drew my attention on Youtube; the Cure. <br /> <br /> Right away, you can say that the film takes an avant-garde cinematic approach, which is telegraphed as part of its use of close-up shots, scopophilia and quick editing. He is proud of his appearance and has the right to be. For the most part, it's a very well composed little piece, with the exception of an inexcusable disregard for the 180-degree rule and a comic gunshot effect, a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card of self-financed projects. <br /> Yet, despite these amateurish mistakes, the majority of shots are actually a pleasure to watch. We are presented with a good use of accessories and locations, a good image and a very atmospheric and fluid edition, which is all the more commendable that it is certainly something that you will not see very often in a submission on Youtube. The plot is fragmented and even though the basic premise is fairly simple, some may have trouble following exactly what is happening, but what we see here is a vanguard narration at work; you can not really expect a simple three-act structure and if you do, you may not be ready for that kind of film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film unfortunately falls, but the sound is poorly chosen. What you will hear all along is a distorted voice that often sounds sincere and even worse, the background music continues, which undergoes very little change and adds little. So much attention is paid to the images that the audio seems frankly neglected, and it becomes obvious when you realize that you have just missed four narration sentences and that you have to go back and find out what has escaped your attention. <Br /> <br /> So give him a watch, but do it with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Did anyone recall the cover of Doug Naylor's novel "Last Human" by Red Dwarf at the beginning of the film? If you have the book, you know what I mean.
