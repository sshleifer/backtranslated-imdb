The Running Man is often considered an Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad word games and shots, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. People used to watch it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of Schwarzenegger's poorest films. <br /> <br /> But give him 18 years and you will find yourself able to appreciate it different light. Rather than just being another brainless action movie, it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It's quite different from Stephen King's book, it's true, but I doubt Hollywood, with his love of optimistic ends and so-called "ordinary guys" who have turned out to have the skills of a qualified commando, would have accepted it in his mind. current form. <br /> <br /> But, let's go to the exam. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a policeman who works in a dystopian American state where democracy belongs to the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government / media conglomerate merger. The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by offering them sadistic games to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a bunch of dogs enraged, and the most popular is The Running Man. , a show organized by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the host Richard Dawson) where alleged "criminals" are hunted by theatrical "stalkers" and pro-wrestlers. <br /> <br /> Some try, however, and speak against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a demonstration in the city of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to "calm" (ie kill) the event. When Richards refuses to shoot innocent people, he is arrested and accused of murdering people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labor camp, but escapes with the help of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and continues his run. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long and he kidnaps his network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those who pursue him, he is again a prisoner, but this He is obliged to appear on The Running Man. <br /> <br /> And of course, the whole movie goes into standard Arnie mode. Richards is thrown into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA still destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) And forced to flee the "stalkers", along with two other prisoners who fled the labor camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protests of innocence and discovers that he is framed. Guess what's happening to him, then? So while Amber, Richards and the other two guys are trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon realize that Richards is not an ordinary cop. This is Super Arnie, the one-man army that can bring down corporate evil dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas light, while remaining your average American with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the film becomes mute, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun. There are a lot of exciting fighting sequences, fearsome puns ("He had to separate" being my favorite), and final confrontation by means of a general formula and a happy ending. It's very amusing to see how Killian reacts in the most "typical" way with a gameshow host, and some of the funniest moments in the series revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the audience and his seemingly benevolent host ( watch out for the accursed old lady!) and for the cold and cynical man, he is quite willing to do anything to increase the odds. <br /> <br /> If you're waiting for a smart and intelligent movie, you'll be disappointed. But if you want a good movie from the 80s, then that's it. But what's great about this movie is that it was pretty prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you watch the entertainment that we have today, you'll have noticed how reality TV is happening nowadays - programs featuring themselves through whatever for five minutes of fame, and producers willing to let them humiliate themselves on television. To imagine that an ugly television officer is not seeking the right to show that people are being executed live is not so difficult to do. We have already had this, however, with Al-Qaida's macabre hostage-off movies posted on the Internet. It seems that, in the current climate, at least some people get along perfectly to watch death on television. <br /> <br /> It is in this spirit that, in addition to the fact that everything nowadays seems like the rebirth of the 80s, you must be impressed by the clairvoyance of this film. Of course, we're not there yet, because it's the terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily accessible programs that have a real human death, but just how long will it take before leaders decide to see if he can find a way to present a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and that of letting go of their morbid curiosity ...
