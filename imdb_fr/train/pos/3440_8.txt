Love Rosario Dawson, think she is one of the best actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> The descent seems to be more of an empowering affair than anything else. This is the constant shade throughout the film. The dialogue is flat, the characters seem intentionally bland and one-sided. The only coherence is the representation of empowerment in the characters and the path Rosario has traveled from empowerment to loss of empowerment, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Presenting this as a rape classic is not appropriate, and that's probably why so many people do not like the movie. The usual audience of "rape" would not particularly like this movie, and that may be the goal? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it confronts its target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and, even if the film does not slap the audience with pious audacity, it engages the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons. <Br /> <br /> The descent is a good film for which IMHO is seriously underrated.
