Bill Paxton plays and directs this very original film. After watching the first time, I realized how good it was. The reviews I heard were correct. As a result, I was expecting at most an average thriller. However, thanks to the excellent director Paxton, the film is worth watching, especially if you are a fanatic of horror film. closing credits. The highlight of the film is the scenario I have to say is very original and corresponds to what I have never seen before. Congratulations also to the two young sons who perfectly convey the emotions of these confused boys. I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend everyone to catch it.
