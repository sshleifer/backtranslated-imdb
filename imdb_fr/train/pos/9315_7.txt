Walter Pidgeon, a well-known lawyer, takes a case of murder on a voluntary basis, is acquitted and finds out that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty, but was also part of an extortion network that reached the highest city. Struck by his own complicity, he began an investigation, discovered the identity of "the unknown" who leads the union and the murderer. <br /> <br /> The irony begins when Braselle is accused of this second murder and Pidgeon must defend it by pointing out the existence of another "unknown" - himself. Although somewhat short of urban and long speech, The Unknown Man belongs to the black cycle less by its style or its structure than by its recognition of the omnipresent corruption of the American municipal policy which was highlighted in the postwar years.
