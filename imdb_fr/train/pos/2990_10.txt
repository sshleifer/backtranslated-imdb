I think it was Ebert who awarded Stella four stars out of four, but I have never read a positive review of this misinterpreted drama about class divisions, love and sacrifice (three themes among the greatest romantics or common movies). <br /> <br /> Here, the main theme is division into classes. Stella is a story of the time of the American depression. That said, it was so memorable on the screen that this remake (if you ask one or more Stanwyck fans) was not really appreciated. Fans of the original never gave him a chance. In addition, this version of Stella was manufactured in the 1990s, while the crisis did not cause big financial problems in America. <br /> <br /> Now is the time to take off the pink glasses, the middle of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and see that this powerful story still rings true, is still relevant and relevant, in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, division by class is the major theme here. Stella is a working poor, single, with big dreams but little hope of realizing them. She works in a bar, does not have much money and lives in a shabby apartment. You get the drift. In the morning, she does not really want to get up. On her wall, images of movie stars she idolizes. <br /> <br /> A man sees her dancing at the bar. He is rich, educated, from a family of the upper class that has nothing in common with Stella. Her main concern is knowing which league college to go to, how to pay rent, how to be "happy". They have an affair. They love each other. Stella ends up pregnant. Stella announces the news. His answer? "Why not an abortion?" She answers, "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He provides the balloons and the proposal, but she sees that her heart is not there and has too much pride to accept. She sends him packing. <br /> <br /> Her daughter is finally torn between the two ways of life: the love she has for her mother and the benefits, happiness and love that her rich father offers her. Stella, alone and unloved, and not wishing her daughter to become as unhappy as her sister one day, makes the ultimate sacrifice. She gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter and perhaps even live vicariously and with hope, knowing that at least her daughter has found something to live. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. Everything is correct about it. Beautiful score, clever cinematography, beautiful scenography (contrast between the two lifestyles, disorder and appetite mansions), beautiful and sincere performances from the cast, with Bette Midler, in particular, worthy of the Oscars. <br /> <br /> It's a much bigger and better film than you've been led to believe.
