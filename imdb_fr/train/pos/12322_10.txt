This film is one of my favorites. It's a mix of ingredients with Action- / Horror / Romantic- / Comedygenre ingredients. Some special effects may seem outdated by modern standards. This minor flaw is easily ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The love relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. The visuals are beautiful too. The action is great, which is not surprising, it comes from Honkong, cradle of the best action movies in the world. The humor sometimes seems a little silly but in a good way. In one way or another, this film is able to balance the different moods and continues to be good. Absolutely recommended.
