How can you say that Peaches, with his complex story dealing with a myriad of problems, is "a little television idea" beyond me. In addition, I can think of many movies that have "a little television idea" in their intrigues. Your obvious aversion to the television industry ("Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background") is confusing. especially since you have a "good time" on television. If only we could all be as talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - Brides of Christ, AFI Award winner, Road of Coorain, etc. Everything is done for TV. When thinking about it, what about these other "little TV ideas" like "Against the wind", "Bodyline", "Dismissal", "Balance of Justice", "Blue Murder", "Water under the bridge ", etc. . I think Peaches is a good entertaining film that interested me and most of my friends from beginning to end. It's far from perfect, but I think it's one of the best Australian films I've seen in the last two years. Who knows, with some additional viewing (there is so much to think), it could well be classics like "The year my voice broke", "The playground of the devil". I really enjoyed this movie more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". I think these films had their moments - surreal, atmospheric, realistic, and dealing with important contemporary issues, but in terms of entertainment for Mr. and Mrs., the average viewer and I was very ordinary, if not boring. . When I go to the movies, I'm always aware of the audience's reaction to a movie (through reactions in theaters and conversations in the lobby and washrooms). Some came out of Peaches shaking their heads, others with negative reviews, but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience.
