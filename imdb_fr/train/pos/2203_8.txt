Me too, I loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952, I was 5 years old and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was the one played by Marion Lorne as a "aunt" character, rather stammering, talkative and very kind. I still remember her comments like "Ubba bubba um um" while she was trying to say something important. And when she came back to play Aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was great to do a casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time that I remembered seeing Walter Matthau, whose career I followed as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question to ask anyone who can check: was the title or end of the music of Hugo Alfven's "Swedish Rhapsody"? Every time I listen to this piece on my classic radio station here in southern California, it reminds me of images of Mr. Peepers moving away, his back to the camera. I'm not even sure this picture in my mind is correct.
