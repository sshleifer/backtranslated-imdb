I almost missed the first season, but when the other series were rebroadcast, I started watching. I ended up buying all the first season on iTunes. It's now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His arid sense of humor made me roll all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way. I appreciate more the other members of the cast (but I'm not saying he does not add anything to the show). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you have not checked this one, try it. If you can see the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good this show is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series will last a long time.
