This is one of the best comedies on TV. Season 1 was hilarious, like most of the following seasons. The only reason I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate last season. The only good part of last season was the final. My favorite part of this show was the scenes that go to people's imagination, often portraying characters from famous television series or movies from the 70s. It's a rare sight to the extent that I loved each character (except for the last season ... too late to try to develop a new character and the fez was not that funny). Red's comments in your ass never got old, nor did Kelso's stupidity. Congratulations to the fox for holding such a good show for so long, even too long.
