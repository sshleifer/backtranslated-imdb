"Panic" is a kind of police drama with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the lead roles. Alex (played by Macy) is a guy who kills people to live. But for the moment, he is facing a depression and that is why he is consulting a therapist. There he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to leave the family business (the murders), but he does not know how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> The following is a guy's story while he's in his midlife crisis, dealing with the usual problems: falling in love with a pretty girl and all that goes with it . <br /> <br /> Very good theater performances. Macy is excellent as a depressed Alex. I had high expectations for this one and it was a good movie but it does not deliver completely. The story was rather flat and clich√©. <br /> <br /> 7/10
