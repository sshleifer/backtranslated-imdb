An excellent description of one of the most unhealthy aspects of this era. I loved the visuals - very appropriate for a story related to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really great in this area. that he did not entirely choose for himself) but still wants to lead a normal life for his family. He is doing his best to make this happen. Do not want to spoil the plot - but YOU MUST SEE this movie if you are a person who wants more of a movie than the usual format shooter Action / gangster. (It's violent though.)
