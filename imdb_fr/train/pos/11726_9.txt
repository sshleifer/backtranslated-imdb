When my sister said that this movie was going to be good, I thought about it, but I watched it and it was really funny. Basically, the film is made of a strange girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and who just wants to go there and read the readings of her aunts who will do it to be able to go there. but it's not so easy. In this film, you will meet a hilarious humor, a witch, a book of spells / recopies, an uncle with an intellectual disability and a dog. You will understand the meaning of the word freak one after anyway, I hope you run away and try to find this very old movie. I hope you'll like it in total, I'll have to give him a 0 ... no, I totally joke, but I give him a hope that you understand that you're going to laugh, you're going to scream and you can be offended . <br /> <br /> really love yours: Dakota, you can send me an email at dakota_loves_it @ hot mail.com if you wish.
