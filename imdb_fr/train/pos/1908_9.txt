This show is beautifully done. At first, I thought it was just a light family comedy with some good performers. It also seemed to express a lot of families, with different concepts of parent and child, however, as I said, I never thought of it more than a good watch in the evening. However, my point of view was shot through the other window when the tragic death of the fantastic John Ritter came to an end. The program kept its promises and really recommended the lives of the characters in a very sensitive way that also touched the hearts of all the admirers of John Ritter, a fantastic actor who has the talent to do anything. When the show aired after Ritters, I really wanted to hug my dad and let him know how important he was to me. I thought it shone the acting skills of the three children, especially Bridget's character, who was worried about the last words she had addressed to him. It reminded me that no matter how horrible I say to my father, I do not want them and it is very important that he know that. Big show
