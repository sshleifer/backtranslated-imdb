In fact, I like the original and this film has its ups and downs. Here are some of them: <br /> <br /> Ups: most of the original actors have been rendered. <br /> <br /> Downs: I did not like the voice of Timon's Ma. I know she made a voice in The Simpsons, but this series is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We come to see Simba as a "teenager". <br /> <br /> Downs: They messed him up with a slug-slomping contest between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who spoke to Timon about "Hakuna Matata". <br /> <br /> Downs: How was Pumbaa made aware? <br /> <br /> Ups: Songs again. (Some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.) <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid songs. (Timon's solo.) <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good movie. I would recommend it to fans of the original. But if you do not like the original, chances are you do not like this one. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
