Julie Waters is always wonderful but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this twisted comedy about the kind of a transvestite who can not suppress his obsession and the changes he undergoes when he discovers it. Of course, he avoids vulgar and rowdy jokes, easy wit and real insights. A very beautiful sweet and discreet comedy
