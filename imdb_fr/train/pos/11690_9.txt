This movie, I'm dying to see. Well, it was not until now to decide to rent it. It was worth it. This film made me laugh from beginning to end. Chris Rock is funny, no matter what movie he's in. However, this should really be his best. If you are looking for a movie for the family, for example for pre-teens and more, it's a dream you can not forget.
