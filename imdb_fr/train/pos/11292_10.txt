I saw this film once when I was a child and fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> It took over 30 years, but I recently found it on DVD - it was not cheap, either - in a catalog specializing in war movies. We watched it last night for the first time. The audio was good, but it was grainy and had the trailers between the reels. Still, it was better than I remembered. I was also impressed by the truth of the piece. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you are sincere to find it, send me a missive and I'll see if I can get you the info. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
