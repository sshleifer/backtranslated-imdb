Poor Ivy: Although born, she had the misfortune to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). As the film unfolds in the 20s or 30s, as the Victorian class's tough ideas begin to crumble, this uncertain status unnecessarily annoys it. The Gretorexes (as they are called) do not know where their next shilling will come from, but there are yachting parties and costumed balls galore to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) gets to know a strong, older man (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born in middle age), she puts on one of his extravagant hats. Fortunately, one of the beauties on which she continues to play (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose surgeries provide a cache of poison, with which she bid farewell to her husband. The fact that it involves Knowles does not put her in phase, even though the hours go by until she is suspended until death by the neck. The shooting of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the dreaded Lucile Watson); and the loyal governess of Knowles (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this melodrama well above average; The bright face of Fontaine provides the rest.
