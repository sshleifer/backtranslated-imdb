Imagine the fate of Richard, a painter, whose true passion is theft. When we meet him for the first time, we see him at the top of a London building with his homemade wings. He tore his paintings and other works, at the height of his despair, and makes a flying device for his jump. When he falls into the police protection system, he does not get a scratch, but lands it in front of a judge who orders him to do community service. Richard, whose relationship with Anne apparently did not finish well, decides to settle in a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn that he intends to use to build his own plane. <br /> <br /> Richard ended up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly. She is a young woman with A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig and confined to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is extremely smart, but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. She sometimes uses a portable device to talk because her speech is unclear. What Jane likes to do is lose her virginity at all costs. Jane and Richard meet, but mutual tolerance puts them at ease quickly. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches porn on her computer, has the idea of ​​finding someone like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo" who, for a fee, will have sex with her. When Richard takes him to London, they find the right candidate for the job. His fees are exorbitant, but they agree. Since they have no money, Richard decides to rob a big bank. Unfortunately, things do not go as planned when Jane realizes she can not do what she wants. In the end, Richard takes Jane on a plane that is roughly built for the thrill of his life, which brings them closer, as they find each other's affinity. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass directed this offbeat movie. film that presents an unusual situation. Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine of mainstream movies, and yet she has such a sweet aura in her that it's hard not to feel it for her and what she's trying to accomplish. Mr. Greengrass shows an affinity with the material of Richar Hawkins that he wrote for the film. The film does not try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman with an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason to watch the movie. She makes a wonderful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh does not seem very well adapted to this type of comedy. In one way or another, he has personal problems in his interpretation of Richard. Gemma Jones has a good time with Anne, Richard's old love. <br /> <br /> "The Theory of Flight" shows a good director. There is no doubt that Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things.
