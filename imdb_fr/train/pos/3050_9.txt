It's just the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. The bad acting, the bad scenario, the bad scenery, the bad costumes, the bad camera work and the bad effects are so stupid that you end up laughing with laughter. <br /> <br /> You will not win an Oscar, but if you 've got beer and friends, you can not go wrong.
