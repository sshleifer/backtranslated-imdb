What an absolutely beautiful film, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, look at it, you will not regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth is wearing the film on his shoulders and although there is nothing more than him, I have always loved. A.R.Hman's music takes a long time to grow but after having heard it many times, you really start to appreciate it.
