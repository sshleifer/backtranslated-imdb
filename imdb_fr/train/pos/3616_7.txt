Incarnating Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius. She is perfect. Her inexperience as an actress plays in her favor. We had never seen it before, so it really looks like its story. It also brings a real tenacity. It works against her, because we never doubt her. You must never encourage her to win because she will never be measured against a fighter whom we do not think we can beat. So, as a boxing film, he fails. <br /> <br /> Again, it's not really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing movie? You do not. But Karyn Kusama has it anyway. Like many independent films, "Girlfight" defies any classification or genre and represents a folklore that could well occur in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana goes bad at school. She beats people she does not like (all the other girls in her school, for example). She is not part of the family. His father forces his little brother, Tiny, to learn to box so he can defend himself when the situation becomes difficult. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives nothing to Diana, as if she did not need to defend herself, or anything interesting to do with her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche ', yuck), so he gives his boxing allowance to Diana, who really wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls in love with another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who is looking to become a professional. From there, the story ends on the inevitable ... the two men meet in the fight for the amateur title. <br /> <br /> What left me cold was that I never found anything interesting. It's just a little too believable. Children who have a difficult life growing up in difficult urban areas go back to sport. Many professional boxers are born from these circumstances. The mental and physical strength of this education lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. A big deal. <br /> <br /> Or there is another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Female boxing has been around for a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing movies is replaced here by discussions about their lives and feelings. The fighting set is used as a platform to paint a larger picture. The respect. Overcome adversity. Discovery of myself. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of the good work a director does for the first time. The dialogue never goes beyond the quality of a TV drama, but the story itself has actually changed my point of view on some things. Yes, the world now seems to be a better place. A movie did that. <br /> <br /> Grade: B-
