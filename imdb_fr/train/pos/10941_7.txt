Sarah Silverman's thought of having her own show worried me at first. The films in which she appeared were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. However, I was very surprised to see his true colors shine in this jewel of Comedy Central. I could possibly put her on an equal footing with Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, quite comparable to Jerri Blank of Sedaris. <br /> <br /> The only fall of this show is its support casting. The character of his sister is good; Funny sometimes, but finally did not want to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the distribution is extremely poor in comparison. <br /> <br /> I'm happy, though, that Comedy Central gave Sarah a chance to show her her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
