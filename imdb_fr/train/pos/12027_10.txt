I saw it and I like it. Melissa plays her role well. It was really believable. My brother-in-law saw it with my sister and me and when I mentioned to my sister that I had forgotten that it was based on a true story (I had seen it a few years ago), he said just because his life is beautiful, you think it's true And both my sister and I were as if it was anyway I was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was was acting or who was really involved because I wanted to prove it to him. I like movies of life, especially those that are true or just those who teach a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I do not remember where help would be welcome.
