Like the classic big cartoons of Bugs Bunny, this movie has a lot of fun on different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and my 11 year old son. Both enjoyed the movie - laughing a few times ... and my daughter is not really a science fiction fan. The movie made me laugh even after seeing many times ... the humor of the adult level (ie a humor that adults will simply get because of larger life experiences, no stuff bold or R-rated here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. For example, in terms of adult humor, Martian voices are based on characters from different films / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and manners of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, Peter Seller Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of top 10 actors plays in favor of the film, and the actors / actresses play their role well - in fact, I would say that the producers have selected the actors and their skills for the needs of the roles in relation to the power of attraction of the film. box office (excellent example is the character "Vern" Wayne Alexander). I had to write this review ... the kids play it for the third time in 4 days after dinner. Good for a rainy day or a weekend late at night there is a movie "nothing on and I'm bored".
