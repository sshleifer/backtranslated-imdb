Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, while recalling his subsequent turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that allows me to watch movies. As a representation of a New York character, only the representation of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York by Daniel Day Lewis comes to mind as comparable, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives in Ratso. <br /> <br /> It's typical of Hoffman's playing that the actor we identify most at Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in film history to play with the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances well above their normal levels. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is so na√Øve that he would completely quit the film, except that Ratso belittles him - belittles him, but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a film about escape that turns into a self-seeking movie. I think that, even if a movie is amazing, it carries a very nice message, no matter how much you are a loser (Ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you can find a way to be true to yourself you are in possession of the secret of life and you might even be able to share this idea with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can not help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which, in my opinion, looks more like a self-directed film about turns into a movie about escape.
