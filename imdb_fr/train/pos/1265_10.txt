hi .. I consider Just Cause as one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, it's a tense psychological thriller with great performances from the cast, especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines I've seen in pretty good movies in this one .. It also has one of the best scenes in the movies ever, when Sean interviews the character of Ed Harris in jail is just fantastic..I ' I really liked this one and I can not recommend it enough, really do not miss that one! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews claiming that the last 30 minutes are nil, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really think Just Cause is a very entertaining movie.
