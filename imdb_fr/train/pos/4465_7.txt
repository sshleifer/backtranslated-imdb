ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining musical for the MGM that will appeal to fans of the genre, but I would not give it a rating with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. It was the first of three musicals in which Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra played together. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two Hollywood licensed sailors who befriend a young boy (Dean Stockwell) who introduces his attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson), a troubled actress who works as a substitute at the MGM. Although both men are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually expresses a preference for Joe, but Clarence later connects with a waitress (Pamela Britton) who, he learns, comes from his hometown of Brooklyn. The paper-like plot leaves room for several major musical numbers, including "We hate to leave," Joe and Clarence's lamentations to their fellow sailors as they leave the ship; Grayson's sizzling rendition of "Jealousy"; Sinatra's dreamlike rendition of "I Fall in Love Too Easily" (a number unfortunately deleted from some of the prints of this film) and "The Worry Song", a fantastic dance imagined by Kelly with Tom and Jerry's animated Jerry the Mouse Fame. Kelly is also doing a kind of fantastic ballet Kissing Bandit that rivals her pirate ballet in THE PIRATE. Kelly is in top shape here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned her only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Sinatra's intimidely shy character here is undeniably sexy. An entertaining entertainment for fans of the MGM music factory.
