Well, I come from Bulgaria where it is almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be "very very scared" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) did a good job with this movie! I do not do it! I do not know exactly how old he was but he did not behave like a child (WELL DONE)! Now about the tornado - it was not very realistic but it scares you! it's the movie!
