After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally finds himself in an invisible ink bottle, which was part of a set of chemicals. He quickly discovers that he's invisible ... so the predictable results happen, which means he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom. Jerry is often just defending himself, but he often has a sadistic trail that torments him whenever possible, even without provocation. <br /> <br /> Here, he makes Tom believe that his eyes are deceiving him when the cheese of a mousetrap disappears before his eyes, or the milk of a dish. Tom can not take it anymore, so he tries to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry fires his paw! Dude, I hope little children did not have the idea to look at these drawings in the 40s and 50s! I always found Jerry, the little mouse, more nasty than cute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, all damage to a character disappears in seconds and returns to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this caricature is about two thirds when Tom discovers Jerry's story and tries different methods to detect the location of the mouse (for example, put flour on the ground to see his footprints).
