Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a film that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American dream. Montana then becomes the "king" of the drug world as he ruthlessly heads his crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This film contains about 180+ words F and lasts almost three hours. This movie is fun and you will never be bored. You encourage the drug lord and, in some scenes, you discover that Montana is not as devilish as some other crime lords. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you to see this. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
