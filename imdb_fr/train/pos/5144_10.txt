This very strange film is unlike anything that was done in the West at the time. With its tumultuous emotions and its network of visions, dreams and striking images, its effect is both beautiful and disturbing. The actors are choreographed more like dance than theater. It contains the only dream sequence I know that looks like a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).
