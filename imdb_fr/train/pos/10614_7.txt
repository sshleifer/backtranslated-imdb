Three girls (an all-female media team, including cult actress Barbara Bach) visiting a small town to cover a festival end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided as the plague. A little shock well done, which suffers a little redundant scenes of dialogue and a plot rather thin (which hides its secrets). An underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock-material), and that's basically what the film gives. Performance and cinematography are pretty much above average (compared to many other movies from the late '70s / early' 80s in the same vein), but what makes me really recommend this movie it's the climax scene long enough in the basement decor. From the moment the character of "Keller Junior" was introduced, her performance left my jaw open and she did not close until the end of the film. A very pleasant surprise to see the actor Sydney Lassick (who was funny wacko in "The nest of a cuckoo flight" and now completely crazy in "The Unseen") plays one of the main roles.
