There have been far too few mainstream films shot in post-colonial Africa, and those that have been mixed up. The latter, with his altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and the worst values ​​of Africa, which are not too different from the values ​​of humanity. It also has shortcomings, given the undue influence of the ideas received from Africans, and in particular Arabs, on accepted ideas. <br /> <br /> The beautiful African American wife of the English doctor David Linderby is captured by Dr. Anansa Linderby. Arab slave traders, as well as a teenager Sanufu and a young boy. The chief slave dealer, Suleiman, is simply the Arab theater, with its flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric, as well as his gestures, which would not be out of place in "Carry On Follow that Camel", but are not up to this standard. the film deserves. Peter Ustinov had of course more skills than needed to remedy some of the shortcomings of the script and he saved what would otherwise have been a deplorable one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continuing on the stereotypical theme, the three Suleiman Arab employees are unwise and one of them has pedophile tendencies towards the boy, which are fortunately not described on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first stopovers is the local police officer, a pompous and incompetent stereotypical African. bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotypical former white upholsterers, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with a "conventional" point of view on inter-Métis relations. He initially refuses to help them unless David pays an immediate payment. Victim of David's love for Anansa and aware of his own inability to find love, he agrees to take David on his helicopter to help Anansa's search. They find that Suleiman and his captives cross the border and are unable to continue on the neighboring territory. Because of Sandell's reluctance and David's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down but David survives. <br /> <br /> We then see that David is introduced to Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who lost his family to Suleiman and who is now only avenged. They find Sanufu's daughter with a group of Tuaregs and know they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, they kill a group of slave traders before they find it was not Suleiman's band and had no choice but to send their captives to the Tuaregs they had met earlier. <br /> <br /> Later, we discover that the boy who was raped is a wizard and excellent scene with supernatural nuances, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's henchmen. Anansa, on his side - and despite the skepticism of the boy - managed to organize the disappearance of the two other employees of Suleiman. <br /> <br /> At that time, Suleiman and his slaves are a few days away from the slave market. <Br/> <br /> Suleiman, no longer doubting Anansa is a "problem", is trying to sell it to an obscurely rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. Upon discovering that Anansa is an American working for the United Kingdom, the prince decides rather unwisely to continue the negotiation without considering the consequences. The scene where the two men are bickering is one of the best of the film. <br /> <br /> At the slave market, the boy is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile, and it remains to be determined whether the boy will still be considered a "braggart" when his owner will be the target of his talents as a witch doctor. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally face Suleiman and there is a bitter end from Malik's point of view. . <br /> <br /> Finally, David and Anansa are reunited and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can console himself for having seen the task he has set for himself. <br /> <br /> The general plot of the film is excellent but it loses some marks for its stereotypical representation of almost all the main characters. All key players should be commended for solving many of the flaws in the script.
