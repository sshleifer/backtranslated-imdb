14 years since this show was done and it's still the best show ever made. The writing was first class and the production unparalleled. This show would never be done today and it's a shame. I hope that if you think about finding this show, you will see what you are doing. <br /> <br /> AG came out the year I left high school when my favorite TV show was x files, which gives you an idea of ​​why I started participating on this show. AG was a much better program with better writing but only one reason? I know it's not the only program to receive only one season. Another example that comes to mind is the solitary shooter (x stolen files). He had good writing and was funny but had only one season. It does not seem right! <br /> <br /> We must also remember that this show was already present before the shows as Twilight made the dark shows "cool"; so I think it may have also allowed the show to go down. <br /> <br /> Look at this program and enjoy! 10 out of 10 for me.
