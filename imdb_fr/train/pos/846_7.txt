Two years ago, I watched "The Matador" at the cinema and I liked everything about this movie. Obviously, I was totally under the impression of the magnificent role of Pierce Brosan. Yesterday, I took this film on television and watched it a little deeper. Now, I can say with certainty that this film is not special, but that you have to love it because of a man. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Brosnan raises the bar with the incredible performance of Julian Noble, a tired hitman who has no friends. Julian soon meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico, an unlucky man: his son died of an accident, his job is not going well and he is not sure he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis ). I have always liked movies like this one; detective film with a great touch of humor. This humor comes largely from Brosnan who tells jokes about angry dwarves, or one of my favorite phrases in this movie: "I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, after the departure of the navy from the Marine." Brosnan says it with its charm by drinking his margarita as usual. I also like Greg's "typical American face" as a very lively loser because there are a lot of people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to watch the best role of Brosnan ever. He will make you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in a movie not so great.
