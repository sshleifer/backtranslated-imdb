This film is amazing and I recommend it to children as adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating. far better than anything American studios produced at the time. However, this statement calls for some caveats. It's a shame that Disney bought Studio Ghibli's late catalog and then slaughtered it. My main point being Disney has redoubled the film, despite the very impressive English version. The new cast with Van Der Beek and others ruined it and removed much of the attractiveness of the characters, for example. Pazu and Sheeta have gone from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. The score of original music is also much better than the Disney remix. This raises the question of why Disney made such changes. It seems to me that if Van Der Beek and his collaborators are chosen, Disney will be able to earn more money, which is fair enough, but they then corrupted the film. It's still a beautiful film and I would always recommend it to anyone. My main beef is that Disney has ruined a childhood movie that I loved and still love. I am lucky to have a Japanese original imported with the original English dub that I will now keep with my life!
