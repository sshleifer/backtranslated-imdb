I love that movie. It is a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-style issues, such as girls wanting to practice a sport previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of an Indian who wants to overcome her cultural barriers and women who want to escape the gender restrictions that exist in sport, especially in England at the time. I think cultural struggles are more accentuated than other problems. <br /> <br /> Unlike the other comment, I do not think this movie looks like Dirty Dancing or any other movie chick. This movement is appreciated by many types of people, men and women, young and old.
