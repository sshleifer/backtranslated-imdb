Ulysses as a film should in no way be compared to the novel, because they are two totally different entities. However, that being said, the film still manages to retain many of the elements that made the book work, but as it is a visual medium, it is harder to draw a flood of consciousness. I think it's the best movie they could have done with the material ... I recommend the book, but the movie is still fun.
