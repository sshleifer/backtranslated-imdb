You speak of a first explosion, "Trampa Infernal" has the coolest opening credits ever recorded! Guided by musical tones slightly inspired by the legendary theme "Friday 13" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the protagonists appear on the screen, divided into giant syllables. A promising introduction in a totally obscure Mexican thriller about slasher / backwoods survival and it's just cooling down every passing minute. Two extremely competitive and overworked testosterone enemies paint the ultimate challenge in a lean bar. According to a newspaper article, there would be a wild bear roaming free in the nearby woods, which would have killed many of the hunters who were trying to catch it. The challenge is to make the bear killer the ultimate macho hero with the most bullets. Upon arrival, however, it soon becomes clear that they are not confronted by a bear, but by a warlike and completely manic war veteran, with an arsenal of weapons in his hiding place and many wiles of combat. After a decade of tame and derivative American slashers, this Mexican effort of the early 90s seems very refreshing and alive. The formula is simplistic but effective, the main characters are sufficiently plausible and the approximation with the sadistic killer is reasonably suspensive. The maniac was to be a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, because he also uses a glove made by him, to which are attached cutting knives and a white mask to cover his face. The killings are pleasantly wicked and barbaric, which I really hoped for since the impressive opening sequence mentioned above, and waste a lot of free blood. The forest setting and in particular the camouflaged traps are happily spectacular. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival hit that is highly recommended for fans of the genre.
