This first part of the BRD trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. Political considerations concern: we see shortages after the war, how the traffickers were able to control a large part of everyday life (delicious when Fassbinder, playing the role of a grifter, trying to sell a complete set Kleist to Schygulla, who notices that burning books does not get much heat: she really wants firewood). <br /> <br /> There is clumsiness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, should go faster. The scene of the train when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI - I tensed, it was so serious. But over the course of history and years, I became more and more attracted to this icy and cold world.
