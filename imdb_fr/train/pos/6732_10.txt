It was the best documentary I have ever seen !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta. I was surprised and happy to discover that this film was also part of his films. Great job Stacy! I was going back to work last week, I was bored less and the movie started. Growing up in Orange County in the 80s, I surfed the local beaches, just like my father, when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me on weekends, I went windsurfing, skateboarding, and then I went up from there. This film captivated me. It was good before my time but it was great to see what these guys went through .. Real pioneers! This film is a collector's item.
