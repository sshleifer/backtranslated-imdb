And I do not say it badly. <br /> <br /> I watched this film at the cinema at the age of 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins, it was magic, beautiful and scary at the same time. . When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, even though we knew he had no idea. Over the years, I have seen this film aired a few times, but I have always changed channels. Even seeing a few seconds would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it that way. <br /> <br /> I only saw this film once and I think it was a good decision not to watch it again. If I saw him today, I would know that I could not help but criticize MJ's acting, intrigue (if there was one) and this and that. For me, it's a childhood memory, that's why I feel my feelings for a child 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I see my adult intervene in my note and give him an 8 for memories and wonderful music. For this small child who watched it 20 years ago, it's worthy of 10.
