A good picture is worth every word. This film presents the most poetic scene ever imagined about people with Down syndrome. And I will not spoil it by telling you. You will want to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an incredible actor. I did not need to understand a single word he said to understand its meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has a magic of its own. After looking at it, I realized better that we put too much emphasis on success and not enough on the people we love. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
