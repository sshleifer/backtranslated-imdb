Allow yourself to be transported into a different, old-fashioned story. Scoop is a classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's last muse, Scarlett Johansson (also featured in Match Point last year, also from Allen), is surprisingly capable of calming his seductive sex kitten and turning himself into a classic student guy with glasses and nasty clothes, he still can not make the public believe that the seigniorial character of Hugh Jackman can be so seduced by her, given the history of the king (do not worry, do not be distracted here). The character of Johansson has no major transformations, because she always plays the same character despite the scenario that says the opposite. You even forgive the apparent lack of logic of his character, continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer, simply because he is his Royal Hotness Jackman, who refreshes to see without the Wolverine misfires. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is what Allen is 70 years old. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid as he has always done. as if he had never been exposed to the making of modern films, which probably makes his films calm and simple attractive. They never seem to target a specific market; as if Allen made films to his liking, whether the public likes it or not.
