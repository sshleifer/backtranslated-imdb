One of the best humorous series to date in Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are excellent actors and performers who seem at home with drama as with comedy. Supported skillfully by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they populated the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. Britain remains insignificant as a poor imitation of their ideas. Always original and revolutionary, I'm sure that many people hate these series that they like, but I'm just as sure that no one could have any opinion on LOG. I have not seen the feature yet, but I have heard good and bad things, so I reserve my judgment. The original radio series at the origin of LOG was as innovative as the television series. I do not know if the television series has arrived in the United States, but I would be fascinated to see how the American public discovered the strange strangeness of humor.
