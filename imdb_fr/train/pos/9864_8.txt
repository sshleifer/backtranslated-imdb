I watched 'The Ice Age' at the movies and I liked the movie. Despite the fact that "the ice age" has many faults and scientific errors, such as humans, swords, dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same time, and even the place where the story takes place (in North America, but has some characteristics of Iceland for example) we can have fun anyway (unless you are very severe!) <br /> <br /> The planet enters an icy age and many animals emigrate in the south where it is warmer. Sid is a lazy idiot left by his own family, who can not stand it any longer. Along the way, he meets Manfred, or how he calls '' Manny '' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and goes north. Worried about the possibility of capturing him, Sid decides to follow Manfred and, in the middle of their journey, they find a human mother with her baby. The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decide to take it and return the baby to humans. Diego, one of the swords, decides to follow and help them find a shortcut to the human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego comes from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby, and also claims to betray them to make them the food of saber. What will happen will depend on the behavior and conscience of Diego ... <br /> <br /> also named "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
