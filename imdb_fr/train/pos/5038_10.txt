What a real treat and quite unexpected. That's what a real thriller is. I rushed into the video store, grabbed a movie without reading the full text on the back and hoped for the best. I was totally surprised and delighted. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought they all gave an excellent performance and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and directed. It interested you from beginning to end and I never got bored for a minute. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to thriller enthusiasts, especially thrillers with rhythm and that hold your attention. Certainly a 10 out of 10 of me.
