There were a lot of science fiction movies from the 50s. They were great draws for Drive-in theaters. Many of them were void even at the time. This film and "The day the Earth stops" stand out and both have aged well in their own way. From the beginning, with its strange musical score of Theremin (which always sounds weird because they are almost never used), Forbidden Planet takes you where no man has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek, this movie contains so much material that Star Trek TOS looks like a pilot of the series. the captain / second lieutenant / doctor, the mad scientist, extraterrestrial beings, the baby in a short skirt, computer intelligence; everything is de rigueur now but it was the first of its kind. In addition, he has well executed and well done works of art that, even today, arouse a certain amount of wonder in front of the images. Consider how deep the enormous Krell machine is described with success. I saw it when I was little (at a drive-in: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course, all the movies that were even vaguely scary were doing it at the time, but I remember being really worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that a science fiction fan can watch several times and find something new for each view.
