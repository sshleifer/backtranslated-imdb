Ah, the 1970s. A time when it was about being a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger, but I felt that my boldness was more daring at that time. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a very good soft-core movie. In fact, like today, some actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and a development of the character. <br /> <br /> That's about what you'd expect from a swinger movie. Two couples with open relationships relive the wandering desire of one of the women who came for a visit. Not much more. <br /> <br /> Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles, that's another story. No less than 40 years look as delicious undressed as Mrs. Welles. This is only worth the price of seeing Mrs. Welles look in the mirror as if she were Aphrodite. She is not the "Stifler Mom". She is much sexier. <br /> <br /> I also searched Anna's Chris Jordan. Jordan looks so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she could be her twin "separated at birth" or even Elaine herself. Anna is still eating but must have an incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> Unlike the soft core porn of the 1990s, the 70s porn softie has retained the realism of the hardcore movie (something the soft core of 2000 has brought back to the occasion, instead of years 90 music and canned orgasms) and he is here in full force. It's not real, but it looks real. <br /> <br /> For those who liked the "Two Women in Gold" produced in Quebec, you will appreciate this one. Another classic movie only on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 CAN per month you can spend.
