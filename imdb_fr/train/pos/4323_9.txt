It's an excellent adaptation and a big mini-series in its own right. Clippings in the plot may disappoint fans of the book (but how many modern readers have read Bleak House without first seeing a movie version - I only know a few). <br /> <br /> I think it's appalling to see critics of the series that have been clearly written by people who have no idea of ​​the story - did you actually see the series or did you just scoop up BBC production because Gillian Anderson was in the most recent version? <br /> <br /> The series captures the mood, rhythm, characters and intrigues (cutting off the Dickensian flourishes that are not needed and harming a cinematic treatment like the story of Turveydrop, the dynamics of the Smallweed family and extra lawyers - Tangle, Vholes, etc. are very truncated). The Jellyby incident was the only omission I wanted to keep, but since the first episode is already a little slow (after the first episode, the pace is perfect), I can see that we have to leave. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I can make is that Jo's death could have been done more faithfully. I can see that it would have almost canonized Woodcourt and that he is a little more human not to have this scene, but I really think that Jo's death is one of the most poignant points of the book and that it missed even though it always makes me cry. <fr /> <br /> Did Theowinthrop see the show? HOW did he think Esther had been raised by her aunt and UNCLE? Who is this uncle? I guess someone who could confuse the name of DENHOLM Eliott with Desmond is not a big fan of English art (film or literature). <br /> <br /> I also think he confuses the treatment of the law. Yes, the law is very badly established at Bleak House. He fails the descendants of Jarndyce, whose precious legacy is eaten up by the cost of justice, but fails the dead Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all those who believe in the pursuit. He fails Miss Flyte. In a sense, Captain Hawdon, who is led to his death by the monotony of the work of copyist in law, is also missing. Yes, he feeds the scavengers of Vholes and Tangle. But it also allows men like Guppy and Kenge to move longer than expected. Dickens would certainly have preferred not to be stuck in the station where they were born (unlike Jo and the bricklayer families at Charley Neckett's exit from poverty). <br /> <br /> In addition, the law, although misused by the vultures of the Chancery and Tulkinghorn, is actually a source of security for the wards of the Court Ada and Richard and for Esther who is simply Jarndyce's pupil. Their security was ensured by the law that transported them to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone could have trouble following the story. Remember that you are not supposed to realize that Esther is the daughter of Lady Dedlock the beginning. You are also not supposed to "get" all the connections immediately. Instant gratification just does not happen to Dickens. As for "seeing clearly" through the fog, Gillian Anderson had such a montage that I found it impossible to follow and that I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely great (too many dramas and dramas do not make a good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they're trying out Gillian Anderson's version). <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick not "Kate"! and you get everything you need from Rouncewell's sub-plot.
