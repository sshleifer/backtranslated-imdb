This night earpiece is better than what people usually say. He has weaknesses, and he seems to have a gender identity crisis, no doubt, but I think his scary atmosphere and his intriguing performances outweigh this disadvantage. All of this sounds like one of those "fire" ghost stories, which happened to a friend of a friend of mine. A big complaint about the film is the rhythm: but the slow and sometimes clumsy rhythm is deliberate. Everything that happens in this film stays within the limits of what is possible, and real life goes a bit - no? So, there are no flashy ends or upsetting revelations, no scenes of "confrontation". Thank God. When you watch this movie, you have to enter the area, forget about your reservations and your expectations about what makes a good movie (conventionally). Williams is not great, but he easily meets the needs of the story. In addition, his character is supposed to be somewhat generic ("No One") since it is the Everyman, the avatar by which we enter history ourselves. Toni Collette's performance should be nominated for an Oscar (although she may not be able to win it). Give a shot. Just for quality and content, The Night Listener is surely one of the top 20 percent of the best movies released these days.
