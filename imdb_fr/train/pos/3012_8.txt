This is one of those movies you would not want to see before - so you can see it for the first time. Van Dine's books always bring pleasure - but they are described as too flowery. This film is by far the best cinematographic adaptation of his works. William Powell is William Powell - do not say more. The plot is complex. The story moves too fast, because you want it to last. Enjoy.
