THE SECRET OF KELLS is perhaps the most exquisite film I've seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the amazing 2D opening sequence of) KUNG FU PANDA, an amazing art direction, a production design, a wallpaper / layout and a wealth of colors which reigns the senses. KELLS is so sumptuous - its almost gothic layout (a bit reminiscent of Klimt's), its flat and wonderful general perspective, its Celtic and illuminated design, but its characters are so simple and appealing - AND everything works perfectly. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are so drawn to every detail of the story and every stroke of the pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and all the members of Cartoon Saloon (and their extended crews) have achieved with this low budget / VERY small crewed movie is absolutely amazing. The wave of support from our animation community is phenomenal. This film is breathtaking and the enthusiasm of our colleagues to recommend it spreads like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS for her many honors, her nomination to Annie and her current Oscar qualifying career. These are all very well deserved nods, indeed ...
