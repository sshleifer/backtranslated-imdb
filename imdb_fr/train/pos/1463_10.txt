Mardi Gras: Made in China makes a wonderful and complex connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the making and throwing of pearls. I saw this film at the Boston International Film Festival and was expecting a disorderly introduction to globalization, but what I got is a captivating screen of shocking footage from China and the United States. The revealing film is humorous, in-depth, serious, non-condescending, and leaves you wanting more as a generic role. It's worth comparing to Murderball - it's just right. Young women workers in China have different points of view and the owner is incredibly open to the discipline. Carnival revelers are in the limelight, but only because this excellent film provides a deeper context inside the factory in China without narrative. Congratulations to the filmmaker for having penetrated inside and finished the film! I would never have thought of the link between pearls, China and New Orleans; Now, I'm thinking of the human link between almost all objects, but also the role of globalization, inequality and pleasure. More importantly, I can make those connections without feeling guilty after watching this movie, unlike other films about globalization that I've seen.
