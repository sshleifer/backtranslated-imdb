It's a good movie. Something fun to watch money being blown at a great rate, especially from the kids' point of view. Take for what it is, a fun little movie about a kid's dream come true and what a kid could do with a million dollars. Do not like it, do not look at it. They make films for observers, not people who have nothing better to do than complain about their lives.
