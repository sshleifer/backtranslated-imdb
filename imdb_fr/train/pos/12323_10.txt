It's the best Chinese movie I've ever seen and, in my opinion, much better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: a beautiful love story, an action movie, a comedy and a horror at a time. And the most amazing thing is that he really succeeds in all of this! <br /> <br /> This film is definitely in my top 5 and should appeal to all cinema lovers. The action sequences have unrealistic traditional jumps and even flights, but the way it's shot differs a lot from Hero's style and the flight always looks great and even makes sense (ghosts can fly). > <br /> See this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
