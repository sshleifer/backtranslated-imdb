Eddie Murphy spends his time looking for lost children. So, when a very special magical kid is kidnapped in Tibet, the sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for her help to save this child from the clutches of evil itself. <br /> <br /> the story is a little silly, you never really feel cheesy, despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film; Charles Dance disconcerts the comedy with its very serious and dark description of the evil that holds the child hostage. <br /> <br /> The Golden Child is very funny, action packed and really very convincing in a charming, almost magical way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Ideal for all generations.
