"Red Rock West" was by far one of the best thrillers of the '90s with a superb script (by John and Rick Dahl) that let you guess during and at the edge of your seat for most of the movie. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and brought together a wonderful cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and more particularly J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance) making this captivating and captivating thriller not to be missed. The film never got much publicity at the time of its release (actually, I first heard it on TV) and so is one of those special little gems that you have to look for, but this movie unique is winning a cult. <Br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broke and unemployed when he is in the small town of Red Rock. Taken for a contract murderer named Lyle in Dallas, he is shocked to be offered $ 10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays with the plan and decides to go out and warn Brown's wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but the plot is boring and there are so many twists and surprises - and double relationships - that Cage is projected to one crisis to another. and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation in which he can not get away! Then, to complicate matters further, the real Lyle shows up to execute the kill contract (played by the heavy favorite Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what happened, he attacks Cage but nobody can predict the surprising events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some favorite phrases from the movie: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman hurt herself, but it's a lot of money ". <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): "Michael Williams, well, Michael, you'll spend time with us until we get to the bottom of this." <br /> <br /> Boyle (Cage): "You're not a killer?" Cage: "That's right, no, but the guy I'm supposed to be in town so you have to get out of there." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "OK how are you". <br /> <br /> An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (barely 98 minutes) with a story that leaves no room and powerful action on the part of all directors. Any movie starring J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad that the career of this exceptional actor was cut tragically by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period of the film noir was undoubtedly that of the 1940s, but "Red Rock West" is a good example modern of the kind. is part of my list of "best ten" favorite movies of all time. I look forward to seeing more from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
