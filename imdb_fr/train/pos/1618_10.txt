This film is brilliant in every way. He approaches the complexity of romantic relationships in a meaningful way, but never gives lessons. The scenario never condescends to any character, not even the unfortunate Johnny. It also benefits from a direction, a conception of the production, a casting and exceptional performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and looks more like "Cher" than it ever was, is a marvel for me. I watch Moonstruck at least once a year and I just saw her on Christmas Eve with my 16-year-old twin girls and they also loved her. He has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end.
