The 14-year-old in me is immensely happy to be able to do some really great fantasy movies and fury with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia at the box office. This year will see (and has already seen) several others, including The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in theaters this week with a little more than a glance. I did not see any insights for that, just a few ads. The critical reaction is a bit blah. I would not even have seen it without the fact that I should wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum and that nothing else of interest would be open this weekend. Well, if you forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been properly aligned because I went to see Stardust and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero searches for a fallen star) full of obstacles. But in this basic scheme, history is alive and imaginative. It is simply to be very fun and to create a charming little novel. And that succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big movies this summer, but none of them were as fun as this one. A lot of things happen, but the story is well told and is almost entirely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it can certainly occupy the same kind of terrain as something like The Princess Bride (though I do not like it as much as the previous movie). A lot of fun to be here if you are a fan of the genre.
