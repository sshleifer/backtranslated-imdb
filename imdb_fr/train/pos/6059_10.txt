It's an excellent documentary, filled with beautiful racing images and a beautiful story. IMAX cameras give you a very broad perspective because a DVD movie is perfect. You hear all the speakers working almost all the time. The film is not accelerated and just gives you the natural feeling of 230mph. Of course, there are some sound effects added but I think they are good, they give depth to the driving scenes ...
