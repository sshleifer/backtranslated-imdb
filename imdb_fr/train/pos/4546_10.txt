This movie will go down in history as one of the greatest, alongside Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to do a sequel! Leno and Morita form an unprecedented comedy duo since Abbot and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you chills. Dingman's character as a jester recalls the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. My God, the climax. I will not spoil it for you, but it makes the explosion of the death star pale in comparison. If you can find this hard-to-find jewel, give yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. I still hope for a special edition DVD one of these days.
