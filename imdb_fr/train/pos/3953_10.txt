I saw this film on television when it came out and I never saw it again. Throughout my life, I could not remember the title and I stumbled upon it by checking Roy Thinne's credits. Excellent dark and scary TV horror movie in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the dark"; and "The school of Satan for girls", all lost satanic classics. I also think it looks a lot like Clint Eastwood's classic "High Plains Drifter". Why do not they release these great little movies, especially when you consider all the latest garbage that fills the discount DVD shelves at Wal-Mart? Most of these movies have a cult, so sales should not be a problem.
