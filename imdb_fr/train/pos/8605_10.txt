Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy play the lead role in this "modern" musical comedy showcasing MacDonald's comic book abilities. The surrealist music of the 40s seems to mock the fashion of the 40s, even though it was fashionable. The dazzling costumes and scenery (yes in black and white) add to the surreal and dreamlike quality of the film as a whole. Several great songs enliven the film, with the number "Twinkle in Your Eye" as climax, including a fun number of jitterbug between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys are also part of the cast. Esther Dale, The Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many more are also visible. <br /> <br /> Fun and delighted to see the wonderful MacDonald in his jitterbug / vamp routines. She could do everything.
