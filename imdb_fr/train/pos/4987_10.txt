Although I like EE books "Doc" Smith and Lensman books by David A. Kyles, the anime, which is loosely based on books, is a fun and somewhat innovative fair. <br /> <br /> It sounds familiar to science fiction and fantasy lovers, such as a kid living on an isolated planet that inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family. It's still an entertainment. In addition, Lensman was THE first animated film to use both hand drawings and CG animations. Of course, this may seem a little outdated, but it is still an innovation. Without Lensman, none of this would have happened (personally, I think Computer Graphics looks better in animation than in real action.) <br /> <br /> Too bad they only released it on DVD / VCD in a format few countries in the world (mainly on quite foreign and different formats). I just wish they would publish the Lensman movie and TV series on DVD / VCD in ALL parts of the world, not just certain parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worsel reigns! I just think he's so amazing and so neat.
