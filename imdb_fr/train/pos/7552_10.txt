CAT SOUP is a short film based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. He won the "Best Short Film" award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and the "Award of Excellence" at the Japan Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When the soul of the little kitten is stolen by death, she and her brother Nyatta embark on a strange journey to recover it. In the surreal dream landscape on the other side, they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable, often disturbing, adventures. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an incomparable anime. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It's very original, incredibly beautiful and has a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surreal (there is no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and bloody. It is more anime for adults than for children (they may not understand at all!). A great trip for those lucky enough to see this absolute masterpiece. A must!
