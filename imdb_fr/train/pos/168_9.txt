It's one of Joan Crawford's best talkies. It was the first Gable-Crawford couple to make MGM and the audience understand that it was a great team, which led the studio to shoot seven other movies with them as co-stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly describes the fall of a brother and a sister who, after the loss of their father in the stock market crash, have to fend for themselves and work for a living. Life is hard in the Depression, and soon even their attempts to find legitimate work are futile, and they resort to underground activity. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is excellent as a worldly man turned moll. She is intelligent, complex and credible. It even tempers the theatrical rigidity of the first Talkie actor actor of the other actors. Clark Gable is a brutal, masculine and gruff diamond like the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with the Crawford character. The same year, he would play a similar and even more successful role alongside Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul", thus ensuring his position as the leading male symbol at MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of role, do not miss "Paid", which she did a year ago, which is also among her best performances at the beginning of the Talkie. <br /> <br />
