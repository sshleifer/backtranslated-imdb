This movie was rather horrible. The last Vipul Shah movie was good. This one was really bad, although it's a good story and it's handled in a nice way. Aatish Kapadia adapted this film from another Gujarati play "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu". 2 1/2 hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this film but it's still an artist. The songs are rather dark and do not work well but they are good overall, not a movie you would watch enthusiastically, it's always a story to take into account and it's good if you're more of a relationship type good movie with a lot of imperfections and humor that is really not necessary even a bit
