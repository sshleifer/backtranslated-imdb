I immediately noticed that this movie was not really based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now have their own puppies. The cutest of Dalmatians was, of course, the little Snowball that was completely flawless until the very end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely. In fact, I have often thought about the possibility that she will become friendly, but now that she has quickly turned into "herself" and announced that she was again Cruella, I almost started to to be really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians. <BR/> <br /> In fact, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin were dining was much better than I expected. I also loved the parrot playing the role of dog and it was incredible that the dogs learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was glad that in the end the Dalmatians were rescued again, but I would have liked to know what would happen to Cruella after the loss of all his property. And what could the home of dogs do with such a large sum of money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was very touching to see that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film.
