This film is an exact copy of a television series broadcast on the doordarshan Indian television channel, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre" meaning balloons. Each episode was new news. The story is excellent and the original is much softer and "convincing". Abhay Doel does a good job, but he does not fit the role of "normal" and "third class" guys (as he calls himself in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi, with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes, would have played the role of the Abhays, but Shayan simply does not have the talent to succeed. <br /> <br /> I would suggest watching the show if it is available. It's the same story except for the race with the mother of friends and the initial introduction. The game of the actors of the television was much better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason this film is a flop is because the director tried to stretch for half an hour (or 45 minutes) of history at 2+ hours. So, it has to slide. Even songs with nasal singing sensations could not compensate. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you have not watched the original TV drama. The script and the end of serial publishing were much better <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ####### # # ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### end of the original series was much stronger, the hero himself dropping the girl, although she thought to be ready to marry her. He is aware and tells him that he does not want to be "reimbursed" and has never helped with this intention. The director or the written script could not capture the original ending of this movie. The original ending would have bought tears in the eyes of the girls and the guys would have acquiesced. The delivery was not fair. <br /> <br /> But personally, I feel it's a pathetic copy. No credit should be given to the director / scriptwriter. The story is amazing and is one of the famous novel writers in PRemchand Munshi's class. I do not know if this is the story of Premchand Munshi, but many other news in the series contain some of the stories of Premchand Munshi and other great Hindi writers.
