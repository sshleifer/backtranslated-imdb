18 directors had the same task: to tell stories of love taking place in Paris. Naturally, some of them proved better than others, but the whole mosaic is rather charming - besides, would not it be boring if all had the same vision of love? Here's how I classify the segments (likely to be modified during a second viewing): <br /> <br /> 1. "Latin Quarter", by Gérard Depardieu <br /> <br /> One of the biggest french actors of my life realized my favorite segment, always with the superb Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Witty and delicious. <br /> <br /> 2. "Eiffel Tower" by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> Cute and breathtaking story (thanks to the director of "Les triplettes de Belleville") of a little boy whose parents are mimes; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries", Ethan and Joel Coen <br /> <br /> The Coen brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious <br /> <br /> 4. "Parc Monceau", of Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá Tambien", "Children of Men"), feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (fun); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes", by Oliver Schmitz, feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. "14th District", Alexander Payne ("Election", "About Schmidt") is a magnificent look at the pathetic side of life. underrated character actress Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in "Million Dollar Baby") as a solitary mature American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tykwer's frenetic style ("Run Lola Run") tells the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind man (Melchior Beslon) who falls in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise", by Wes Craven, feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious cameo from Alexandre Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Far from the 16th", by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but touching story of talented Brazilian directors, feat Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" by Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), a sad feat. always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais", by Gus Van Sant, feat. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Fidèles (simple but fun); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine" by Vincenzo Natali, feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quays of the Seine" by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires", by Nobuhiro Suwa, feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille", by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underrated movie "My life without me"), feat. Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle", by Richard LaGravenese, feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", of and with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. Christopher Doyle's "Porte de Choisy" with Barbet Schroeder (best known for being the director of "Barfly", "Reversal of Fortune" and "Single White Female"). <br /> <br /> I could classify some segments. as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring), but not one is bad. All in all, I give in Paris, I love you 8.5 / 10 and recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic about love and other things in between.
