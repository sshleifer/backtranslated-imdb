The anime that made me addicted to anime ... <br /> <br /> Since the year 2010 (hey, it's not so far now!), The Earth is now a good ground toxic gases of pollution and violence. Seeing that crimes still occur 30 seconds and committed by thieves with the firepower of third world terrorists, the fictional city government of New Port City trains the tank police to deal with the problem - tank cops! Oh madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include new recruit Leona Ozaki, a Japanese with red hair (yeah, I know, they never correspond to their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance) who has just to be enlisted in the tank police and is quickly associated with Al, the nice boy with blue and blue eyes. Leona is a new tank user and she unfortunately destroys the favorite tank of her favorite commander, Charles Britain (also known as "Brenten"), who looks like Tom Selleck with steroids and wearing a pair of clever sunglasses , a big revolver and a bad character. Britain did not like Leona joining the tank police in the first place and destroying her Tiger Special (a giant monster tank) she does not really like it, he does not like it either let her take the remains of her giant tank. and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknamed Bonaparte and he is soon trying to transfer it to the child protection service "where boys have more your height", as he says. There are also Specs, the bifocal genius, quoting the Bible / God fearing, the chaplain, purple Mohican, and the valiant grand chief, who is at the limit thanks to the mayor who shouts at him about the police's antics. tanks. Seeing that tank cops often destroy half of the city while pursuing the villains and using extreme violence to capture them, they are not much loved by the people. <br /> <br /> The "bad guys" are a cyborg Buaku, who has a mysterious past, is linked to a project called "Green Peace", his gang and his two sexy cyborg companions, Anna and Uni Puma. In the first installment, these guys are paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who have not been infected by toxic gas clouds and for the second they are hired to steal a paint representing a naked Buaku. The story, however, was unfinished in the anime and ended in a cult comic book ("Manga"), very hard to find. <br /> <br /> All kinds of chaos and chaos ensue in this black comic adventure. it looks at how far people want their police to go to catch criminals and what happens when the dividing line between good and bad begins to fade. That's the kind of thing that if you were to make a movie, you'd better get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but still very fun. <br /> <br /> Follow-up of "New Dominion: Tank Police".
