Ah, a musical Kelly / Sinatra in sailor costume. So familiar, no? Yes, but it's not the one you usually hear about. On the city, it's like that. But if you stay, you could learn something. Ok, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on leave of three or four days. Joe is the "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, the type of book, begs Joe to make him a "lady". Now, once picked up by the brass, they bring the little Donald home. This is where they meet Susie, this temptress, this jezebel. I laugh! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he's doing it. Is he right? Or is he a moron? Or is he simply misled by society? Check out all this and more when you watch {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson be anything but disgusting, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
