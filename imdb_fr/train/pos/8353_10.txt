I remember seeing this film as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO was showing it late at night, when it was one and the same pay channel. At the time, it was UNRATED and was the only film of its kind to have been broadcast on pay-TV ... especially at the time. I would love to see him now as an adult, where I would be better able to understand the adult theme. It was probably the closest thing I had ever seen in pornography at the age of 7 or 8. Fortunately, I had stupid babysitters and parents who were having fun on weekends. Most of my memories of this movie were the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into houses to sniff underwear, eating a stranger's breast milk on a public bus and taking a cab to take a taxi at the request of one of their wives, it was only of some of the escapades that these guys were doing. A very racy movie for the early 70s. Until I checked IMDb, I did not know that this movie was so successful. Most people I speak to have never heard of it.
