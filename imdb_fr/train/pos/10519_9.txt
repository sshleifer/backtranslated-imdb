I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and besides being a feature film (a real fan wants to see as little as possible, and that can only be done in a mini-series), it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the rich, slightly helpless but well-intentioned girl, and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly with his coolness and nobility. I was not enthusiastic about Ewan McGregor, although I really like him as an actor, but I do not think it spoils the film. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen, I would have liked to see things that were not, but that would have made it possible to extend the film and leave a film longer than expected. well. I saw all the adaptations of this book and I thought it was the best!
