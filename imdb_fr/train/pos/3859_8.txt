De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) by Paul Verhoeven is one of the most compelling thrillers I have ever seen. It was really a nice surprise. The story concerns the bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), who draws him into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renee Soutendijk), but in Gerard's twisted mind, the story could tell more. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful, thick atmosphere full of surreal and disgusting sexual images. It really plunges you into the story, you do not want to look, but you can not turn away. It's by far the best Verhoeven movie (maybe right after Robocop). True The Fourth Man is not suitable for everyone, some sex scenes are quite free (do not ignore them, but trust me, if you look at least ten minutes, you'll be hooked.) This is one of those movies you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and exciting, I even like the metaphor of the spider. <br /> <br /> 8/10
