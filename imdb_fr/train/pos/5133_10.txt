Each of the major studios launched jazzy one-reelers in the 1930s and 1940s (with Universal in the lead). Warner Bros. (which suddenly stopped making them in 1946) is often distinguished by camera angles, mirrors and off-the-wall optical effects, thanks to creative directors such as Jean Negulesco. It is normal that the best of this kind comes from this studio. <br /> <br /> What sets "Jammin 'The Blues" apart from the rest of the band is that it's more like an avant-garde experience than a Hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, it transforms an ordinary jam session into a "dreamy" escape from war dreams, highlighted by the melody of "On The Sunny Side Of The Street". Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (who will later work with Hitchcock) enjoy great artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio did not care at all about how he and his fellow musicians were presented. The optical printer is exploited, several images of the same artist appearing at the same time. (Norman McLaren really treated this process two decades later to "No Two", while the Linwood Dunn team had different effects in "Citizen Kane".) The focus on silhouettes and smoke from lit cigarette was also ahead of its time; in some ways, this preceded the psychedelic sixties, but with a distinctly 1940s movie noir style.
