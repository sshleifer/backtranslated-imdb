Many people have this problem with the movie, they seem to think that the story should have been more fun (ignore it is based on a true story) or run wild against a movie that glorifies Che (which is really not the case). ). This film is very close to Jon Anderson's final biography on Che and tells the story correctly. Soderburgh does a great job setting the mood for the unstoppable debacle of Che's Bolivian adventure. You really have the impression of the total shyness and confusion of the Bolivian peasant faced with the revolutionary ideas of Che or difficulties that his men had to face with hunger and relief. Sorry to catch the attention of film fans, but that's how things went. So do not go into this movie, expect Rambo to be filmed, it's a true story!
