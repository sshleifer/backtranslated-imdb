Although far beyond the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so I'm naturally intrigued by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery involving a deceased actress is presented in simple and simplistic terms, with spikes of danger for the young bloodhound. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so younger members of the public will not be angry. <br /> <br /> What I really enjoyed about this story is that the final results were rather serious and meaningful and that Nancy seemed to understand and advance the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great like Nancy Drew and I hope we'll see her again under another mystery.
