Many critics on this page mention that this film is a bit dark for children. It depends on the kid. This is not a movie for a child from 2 to 6 years old. It is more suited to 8 years and older. I saw this movie when I was 10, I loved it. At the time, most animated films were a little too childish for my taste. This film deals with more serious problems and therefore has a slightly more emotional impact. In this movie, the characters can die and be sent to hell! This gives a little more emotional weight to scenes where characters risk their lives. Good guys are not always perfectly nice and kind (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
