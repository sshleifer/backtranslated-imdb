This film takes you so deeply into the two main characters. I inserted it into my laptop without even reading the cover (not to mention the reviews) and I was intrigued for two hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that is created between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable, even with virtually no physical contact. Towards the end, I could not choose which of my dreams: our hero and our heroine had to withdraw their hug or simply consume their passion. RML could have done without a curious secondary plot and a hundred minutes would have been enough. I am nervous though. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local libraries, this movie has given me confidence in a great achievement.
