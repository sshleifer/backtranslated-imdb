I have a weakness for old black and white films of this kind, the films of Will Hay and Abbot & Costello, especially since these are my favorite movies. I chose this film on DVD because it used the same idea as "Oh Mr Porter" of Will Hay, which is one of the most beautiful comedies ever made. I just finished watching this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie ended at 12:45). I find that films like this, like Ghost Trains, are best viewed at night with the lights off. In this way, you will enter more into the scenario and the night viewing will work well with this movie. <br /> <br /> The one-liners in the film may seem a little old-fashioned for some viewers, I guess it depends on the viewer. They are not dated to me yet. I'm 28 and even though I'm not old enough to have been there when this movie was released (my dad was though). I still have a lot of respect for some old movies like that. Sitting in the room in front of the television with snacks and drinks, and relaxing at night watching these movies, little can beat the feeling you feel by doing this. It's an escape from reality for a moment. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men of the film (he has a black mustache), he appears about three quarters of the film after the crash of his car. and he is looking for a woman, he was followed at the station. This man was also part of Will Hay's classic "The St Michaels Ghost". I just thought I would post it in case nobody noticed it :). <br /> <br /> The sets in the film are very atmospheric. Outside the abandoned train station looks good and as if there was no soul to miles in all directions, and the interior of the station is very comfortable, away from the rain storm who reigns outside. I felt like I would have liked to be there in the movie with the cast. The atmosphere in this film is something missing from many movies now. This allows you to stay hooked from the beginning to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> We need more of this type of film on the current market. But unfortunately, it could be neglected to prefer nudist films and gross and coarse moods. This kind of cinematographic era (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) is for me the golden age of cinema!
