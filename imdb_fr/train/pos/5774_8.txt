A meteor falls from the sky and awakens a plesiosaur that once terrorized the Crater Lake area. While the monster eats the locals, they try to kill the monster. <br /> <br /> Recent attempts to send out old horror and sci-fi movies like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are a bit jarring to have movies like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. This is the kind of movie that these movies falsify and send only, it's the real deal. That's all these movies are trying to be just without the tongue in their cheeks and it's so much more fun because of that. This is a real kind of movie that was unlucky enough to be released just as Star Wars was changing the way we look at special effects. The monster, a mix of stop motion and life-size head, is a small beast with picturesque charm. Filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its chaos. Of course, it is clear that everything is wrong, but the films on the suspension of disbelief are not they? In fact, I think they are really cool monsters, which is the case. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a low budget player. If you want an authentic player in a monster movie, look no further. It would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar movies on lake monsters (Boggy Creek, etc.)
