This movie was very very strange and very very funny. All actors are very real and very strange. The film's "look" was also different, a kind of dream and whitening, which only added to the feeling of space, trial and error of the whole. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, I mean, it's not what you would call "mainstream" but that's what I liked. It does not look like anything I've ever seen before. . . unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and lines of punch in the strangest places. Children are so disgusting (and pimply) that you can not help but feel for them. In other words, these versions are far from being "Hollywoodized" teenagers. <br /> <br /> All this, for me, makes it a good thing.
