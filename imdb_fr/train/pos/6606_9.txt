It's time for Hollywood to sit down and take note! If the actors act in a snooty way, all you have to do is call in the animators who worked on this little wonder. Renaissance is probably the first animated film that makes you forget that you do not see any human beings. Although the voice over the cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are among the best I've ever heard, the emotions illustrated by the "cartoons" are nevertheless annoying. <br /> <br /> This style of animation is not new, but the use of light and shadows makes the film a living painting. Ironically, such technical magic makes you forget that it's actually a very, very beautiful movie. The pace and unfolding of the plot are wonderful and the dialogues are clear. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: The disappearance of the highest employee of the mega company reveals a story of deceit and corruption with a fearless hero at the helm. I can not say much without revealing everything ... except that, even if the film keeps you at the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you speechless. <br /> <br /> You have to look ... even for the 'adults' who smile at 'cartoons'
