I do not know if I'm just weird, but I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Cabin by the Lake is of course the sequel to another of my favorite Cabin by the Lake movies. In fact, I think I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one. I also thought the cast in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second film focuses on the shooting of Stanley's Cabin by the Lake. It was not a completely redundant movie showing Stanley taking girls and drowning them. - If you are looking for a deeper meaning, then this movie is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it. I have probably already killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
