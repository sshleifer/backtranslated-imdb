"Gray Gardens" (1975) is the Maysles brothers 'strange documentary about Jackie Bouvier Kennedy, an eccentric aunt and first cousin who lives like a pig in a dilapidated 28-room mansion in East Hampton, Long Island.Big Edie' Bouvier Beale, 78 years old, witty and dry, and her daughter 'Little Edie' Beale, 56 years old (about 13 years old with emotion), a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future, lives isolated from the rest of the world, with the exception of her many cats and raccoons the attic. They have fun bickering all day, listening to the radio or singing (they do not even have a TV). Their fall from society is incredible, and the viewer is attracted to these two very special people, even though they are obviously dysfunctional. One of the best documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.
