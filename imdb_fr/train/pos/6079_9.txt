Shakespeare plays transcend time. The tongue breaks in a way the barrier of time. but maybe it's the actors who really do that. <br /> <br /> after the disappointment of Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), hesitated to take another modern interpretation of Shakespeare. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> The character of Iago has been so well interpreted by fellow Kenneth! Although Iago is really mean and despicable, the character has been so well played that he does what Shakespeare wanted the charater to be, a pleasure that the public hates. I must say that fishburne's performances here were also very good. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to both Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
