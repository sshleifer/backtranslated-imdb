He now has a name, an identity, memories and a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, but they still found him and destroyed the world he had barely built. Now he wants explanations and get rid of people how he became what he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back and this time he is here with revenge. <br /> <br /> OK, this film does not have the most elaborate scenario in the world, but its theme is very intelligent and ask serious questions about our society. Of course, like all Hollywood movies since the late '90s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is a story of superheroes. Jason Bourne is like a project of Captain America, which has completely disappeared. In the first film, the hero discovered his abilities and accepted them in the second. He is now fighting against what he considers to be an evil, after a person close to him has been killed (his girlfriend in "Suprematy") by them. It's all part of the history of superheroes, including a character with superpowers (realistic but still impressive: he's almost invincible). <br /> <br /> And the interesting point is that the evil he fights around the world (There are no borders in Bourne's movies, the characters are moving from one continent to another. other in the blink of an eye), is, as in the best seasons of "24", an American enemy who believes that he is fighting for the good of his country completely blind. It's funny how "crazy patriots" are now N.1 enemies of Hollywood paranoid stories. <br /> <br /> In addition to all these interesting themes, the film is not flawless: the female character of Nickie Parson is now completely useless and the direction is quite original as regards the scenes of dialogues. But all this does not matter, because "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are rather impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is talking about the "Waterloo Scene" and the "Tangier Pursuit" and everyone is right. I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tangier, which reminds me in its exaggeration and madness the works of Tsui Hark. Visually inventive scenes, many intelligent action scenes and a good reflection on the contemporary American theme: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is undoubtedly the best film of the series and a very interesting and original action film.
