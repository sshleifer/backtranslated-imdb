Based on a screenplay written in part by Nicholas Pileggi, best known for writing the book Wiseguy, which he adapted to the film Goodfellas, and for writing the book and scenario of Casino, director Harold Becker shows how connected circles rub their backs, even in the command of a relatively honorable mayor like Pappas, considered a presidential prospect. While Cusack follows the written record of the deceased gangster's probation report, his skepticism is agitated. How did this violent young man get a probation rather than a prison sentence? We meet the other conspirators, including Danny Aiello, the political leader of Brooklyn, and Tony Franciosa, the boss of the mafia whose nephew was shot. How and why these people are affiliated, I leave it to the film to reveal it, even if they are never worried. <br /> <br /> The story is usually told through the eyes of the character of Cusack, a visionary of Louisiana. who admires his boss and hopes to learn from him. Everyone benefits from the bureaucratic knowledge passed down from generation to generation. Part of the dialogue is incredibly scholarly, but since I just described the building blocks of history as bureaucratic knowledge, it can not be said that it does not work. The shootout opposes the easing of two other problems on the mayor's desk: a charge of Aiello for a subway station and an off ramp in Brooklyn to help a new banking center, and the city's bid for the next democratic congress. Individual idiosyncrasies are also explored, including Aiello's emotional connection to the music of Rogers and Hammerstein. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of talk about menschkeit, a Yiddish expression that explains Pappas to his deputy, about the link between honor between two men, about what happens between the two hands in a handshake. This link does not make much sense for Bridget Fonda, the lawyer of the police association who defends the honor of the deceased policeman and fights for the pension of his widow while compromising evidence appears. Gradually, the Deputy Mayor understands that menschkeit is such an influential notion that it surpasses its law. <br /> <br /> There are different shock scenes, including the one where the Brooklyn boss comes home for lunch. In the middle of the day, his wife declares her interest through the dish she has cooked, then the mafia boss falls by surprise. There is also a convincing and clearly conjectural late scene between the mayor and his deputy. <br /> <br /> A delicately handled scene includes the Mayor's decision to speak at the funeral of the child killed in a Harlem Church. His advisers tell him he will not be wanted there. But he goes anyway and attacks an alleged shameless hyperbole, Pacino and his character. <br /> <br /> This arouses an impressive reaction from the congregation, but the mayor knows, and his deputy, that it was artificial, and the way they scrupulously avoid discussing it, in the limousine who takes them, is a subtle use of calm and innuendo. It's a scenario that knows he has to give Pacino the reason why most of his fans will see him and immediately follows his quota with the reality that silence has a much more inherent meaning than speech. <br /> <br /> Pacino and Cusack are convincing together throughout the film, the old man unbreakable and aware, the youngest eager to learn, but with ideals that do not change. Pacino is innate with its down-to-earth ability to marry common sense and inventive imagination, inspired flair and realistic realism. Cusack moves very freely despite his dark defense. <br /> <br /> The subplot of Bridget Fonda is not necessary, but it stems from the insightful belief in the insight of the writer Paul Schrader in the value of each character. is embodied in serious embodiments. Aiello, for example, is a highlight because it evokes the joy of living of his character and his sensitivity to the environment.
