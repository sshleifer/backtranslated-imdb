I started watching the show in the first season and at first I was rather skeptical about it. The original movie was a bit childish, and I was just looking for a science fiction show while waiting for the new BSG season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes, I became a fan. I loved the characters - Jack O'Neill, the not-just-stupid-as-you-think-he-is, the not-only-smart-Samantha Carter, the glorious Teal'c, the favorite of women and children, and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Of course, stories sometimes not serious, sometimes ridiculous, but most of the time, it is not about technologies or fights in space. It's about helping your friend or risking your life for him. It's about "we do not leave anyone behind". Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About free will and all the qualities that make humans - Human. <br /> <br /> And now, this is a record, a 10th season and always good.
