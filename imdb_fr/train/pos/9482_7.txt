Henri Verneuil represented commercial cinema in France from 1960 to 1980. Always strong at the box office, and generally telling dramatic stories and full of suspense of casino thefts, Mafia settlements and battles of the Second World War, we could count on Verneuil to give us two good hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his time: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... as Icare is the only time he realized Yves Montand. It is a strangely static film, mostly in offices and conference rooms, not containing a hunting scene and having virtually no violence. <br /> <br /> Montand gives a good performance, although slightly dry, and is well supported by the other actors. I could not help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, based on Z (the assassination of Lambrakis) and the confession (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
