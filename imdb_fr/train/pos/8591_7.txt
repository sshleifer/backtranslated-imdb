It was a pretty decent film. This movie is good for just sitting and watching and being entertained. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and certainly does not deserve one, but I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like the show 24 but in film format. If you like everything we need to do to prevent the terrorist from killing the president, you'll enjoy this movie. Personally, I think this story has been made MUCH too much, but The Sentinel adds a little twist with the mole in the secret service. All in all, this film will not leave your jaw on the ground and will not change your life, but who says that every movie has to be like that to be good?
