And a plot rather unexpected also for the time: there is the plague in the city of New Orleans and only Richard Widmark can stop it! The key topics of Elia Kazan: seafront, workers, crowds, fugitives, blue-collar workers, violence behind the scenes are all highlighted here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is quite effective as a cold gangster A big score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise a little miscast but certainly observable as his go-iron. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as a strong, cool woman - I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. <br /> <br /> Himself always reminds me a little Sinatra - in the face and in a very quiet way - and it's supposed to be a compliment. I had never even heard of this movie, and yes, you have to admire the performance of Widmark. I also liked Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, they form an improbable but effective team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you must know that she is not exactly made as she would have been in real life - rather on a small scale at least no? - but I found that the plot worked well. <br /> <br /> Find out. Its good. *** outta ****
