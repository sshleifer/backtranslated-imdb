I am a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already knew quite a lot about the Beatles 'music and the truth behind the breakup, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul Wings' band. I was curious to see how this film would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed by this film. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references used by both musicians were very specific. Yoko Ono would always be with John wherever he comes, the Wings song "Silly Love Songs" being this year's number one hit and the rooftop concert of Apple Studios playing the music from the album "Let It Be" . The actors played John and Paul very well. The accents could have used maybe a little more work, but they seemed to act as if I had read the two old Beatles. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was essentially what the whole movie was. <br /> <br /> The end at the beginning disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you will appreciate it, especially since it was how it happened in real life. They also show the fantastic "Saturday Night Live" skit in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to perform. (compared to the 220 million dollars that others offered them) Overall, I was not disappointed with this film. It really gives you a better idea of ​​why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back together.
