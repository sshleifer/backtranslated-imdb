This one will have reviews on the whole map, because it does not correspond to any mold. It's a horror, but not a splatterfest. It's both suspense and horror, without the usual Hollywood screams and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is sober and slim without special effects because I think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe. It's a red herring. He acts here. "Camp" is a misinterpretation of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives a rock solid performance, so she must believe that the scenario has something to say. We all know the sorry excuses where the actors are obviously no longer interested and expect the director to take "Cut" and get his salary. That is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with an almost worldly regularity. I do not think the intention was humorous-- but to keep you out of balance. <br /> <br /> Think less about a horror "movie" than about a "horror game" on a stage - this whitewashed house. Then you may see that paranoia, fear and spiraling madness take place in a remote place in the United States. <br /> <br /> And he's crooked. Time travel, mental control, secret and Nazi experiences that may NOT be dead. . .yet. <br /> <br /> I say: praise him and try him if you want something slightly cerebral. It would be a good choice for a sat midnight Saturday.
