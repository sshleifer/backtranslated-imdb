Homelessness (or the homeless, as George Carlin has stated) has been a problem for years, but has never been a plan to help street people who were once considered humans and who have done everything to go to school, work or to vote. Most people think that homeless people are just a lost cause and worry about racism, the war in Iraq, the pressure on children to succeed, technology, elections, inflation or worries of being on the street. . <br /> <br /> But what would happen if you had the gamble of living in the street for a month without the luxury that you once had of a home, your entertainment devices, a room bath, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you cherish once to see what it means to be homeless? This is Goddard Bolt's lesson. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (the director) who plays the main role of Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until he decides to make a bet with his rival (Jeffery Tambor) if he can live in the streets for thirty days without luxury; If Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project to build several buildings. The bet is to know where Bolt is launched in the street with a bracelet on the leg to monitor each of his movements without being able to leave the sidewalk. Pepto was nicknamed Pepto by a vagabond after it was written on his forehead, where Bolt met other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a former dancer who divorced before losing her home, and his friends Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) already used to the street. They are survivors. Bolt is not. He is not accustomed to making mutual agreements as he once was when he was rich: fight or run, kill or be killed. <br /> <br /> While the love affair between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to draw, I discovered "Life Stinks" is one of Mel Brooks' watching movies which, before being a comedy, shows a soft side compared to his stupid work like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs, to show what it looks like. something precious before losing it the next day or in return for making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it as Monopoly money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie will inspire you to help others.
