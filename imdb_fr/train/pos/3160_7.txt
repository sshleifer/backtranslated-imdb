This show has all the typical characters of a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it's about the 70's. That's the only difference he has with d other television comedies. I do not know how you can like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is this: "Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want to sleep with you." (Audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. Fez: Oh yes, I am. (Audience applauds and applauds) "It's not funny. I think if there were not those laughs (I do not know what you call it in English, sorry), you would not laugh at all. It's not an intelligent comedy, it's an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but it's not good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English.)
