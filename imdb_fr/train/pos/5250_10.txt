The world is composed of two types of moviegoers ... There are the "English Patient" types, which can not be bothered to take advantage of everything that is not enough eyebrow to be shown on PBS, and there are the "Happy Gilmore", for whom an hour and a half of genital play is well worth the 7 dollars. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are a ton of gray areas, but you know which side you are leaning on. If you are an English patient, save your time, save your money and save us all your comments "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid". I know you really like to minimize every movie you do not like, and every person who loves them, but you might stick to it at one time. <br /> <br /> But if you're like Happy Gilmore. .. go see this one ... you'll find it hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell continues to be hilarious in almost everything he does. Go check it out. You will be glad to have done it. And it's good.
