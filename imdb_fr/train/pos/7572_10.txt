I just can not believe that these games can be so much better, but that's the case. Unfortunately, I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even if I beat her, I can not wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games I must have, even though I beat them several times. I hope they will never stop creating this type of game, even if the show ends. <br /> <br />
