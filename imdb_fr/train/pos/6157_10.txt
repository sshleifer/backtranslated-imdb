It was a movie I never thought I would see until my 3-year-old son saw it at the video store and caught it after I liked the animal cover photo on the island. Nabooboo. We have had it and have watched it many times since; in fact, we have rented it several times since. There are very few non-animated films that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. The acting is exceptional, the songs are convincing, they plunge you into the head and you can not help but sing. The scenario, though specifically dedicated to World War II, is timeless in its own way and there is something new to see every time you look. I've heard about it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think it's two very different films, both great, but my son has no interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and a movie that parents will not want to bend. There are days when we watch him before nap time and bedtime, and I do not feel that moan coming when he wants to repeat another movie.
