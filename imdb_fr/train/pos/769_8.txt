Of all the breakdance / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 Beat Street is undoubtedly the best. The story follows a DJ, his younger breakdance brother, a graffiti artist and showbiz promoter looking for a winter where they try to get out of the ghetto by using their "street" talent. The acting is not always up to par and the characters are not completely drawn, but they are more than offset by a realistic dialogue, a plausible story, fantastic dance sequences and a hip-hop soundtrack timeless. It should be noted that this film was shot in the birthplace of the breakdance ("This is not New York, it's the Bronx!") And includes appearances of the fathers of the breakdance, the dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew is the best scene of the film when it dominates a dance battle at Roxy, the most important breakdance club of the early 80's. A must for hip-hop lovers.
