So, your friends are sleeping? The woman visits the mother-in-law? However, you are at home. It's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on TV and the dishwasher needs to be stacked? So now what are you going to do? <br /> <br /> I will tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make an old-fashioned cocoa (Frys is the best!) Take some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now select and play the thriller / horror Arthur The Askeys World War, return to this comfortable sofa and enjoy the night! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is a real classic of the time of the British war! Arthur Askey with his side kick, Stinker Murdoch, entertains you and I suspect the cast, high octane, thrills, chills and spying. It takes place in rural Old England during World War II. <br /> <br /> It is centered on a motley group of people who have to spend the night, in circumstances beyond the control of everyone, in an old waiting room of the railways, discovering that an old train haunts them. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds perfectly and precisely, and it is a credit for the entire cast, it is humorous at times and sometimes really scary! <br /> <br /> (The tale was written by this old boy, Godfrey, of the glory of the Army of the dads, and he is smart) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey is fun and is very at home to teach you his routines and casting, he also shows that he can act a little! The actors never get on stage, even the janitor and the parrot help to give the film the necessary gravitas. <br /> <br /> Oh, when it's over, do not forget to stack the dishwasher!
