What is so taboo about love ?! People seem to have big problems with transgenerates. <br /> <br /> The title of this film did not catch my attention. It was a gritty shot that took about 4 minutes in the movie, which made me stop browsing the channels. I could not believe how incredible this movie was. It touches so much human emotion that he did not fail to move me one way or another. This is by far one of the best independent films I have ever seen. I did not consider these characters as either sex, just as human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Praise to all intrepid filmmakers!
