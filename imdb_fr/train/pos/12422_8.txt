With mixed reviews, I was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very entertaining little detective film with interesting characters, excellent performances, easy writing without being casual and a good rhythm. It looks good too, in a funky way. Apparently, people like this movie or hate it, and I'm from those who liked it.
