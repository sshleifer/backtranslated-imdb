I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK appeared in the TOP 10, but that it was not even included in the TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This film has a bad reputation because 'Ewoks, but There's so much reason to love this movie: <br /> <br /> - Han Solo Rescue of Jabba: this official ends the sub-plot Han Solo related to the debt created during from the first encounter with the character of A NEW HOPE. <br /> <br /> -The Emperor has finally been revealed: Well, it may not work as well now that the prequels are out, but it was the first time we saw the Emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - The Bike Chase Speeder: All right, so it was a special effects moment. But it was without a doubt one of the most memorable and exciting moments of all movies! <br /> <br /> - The culminating point in 3 parts: 1) The battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke confronts his father & The fall of the emperor 3) The destruction of the second death star (Lando moment) <br /> <br /> -The final celebration with our heroes: As I said, this movie has a lot of bullshit because of the Ewoks but I think it's rather cool that while the whole galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are holding their own private party in the woods. <br /> <br /> In summary, this final is an excellent final. chapter for our heroes and an appropriate end to the story of STAR WARS.
