The film is not breathtaking in the conventional sense of the term. It does not present a series of pretty pictures. Instead, it's a visually interesting movie. This forces the viewer to constantly deal with or perhaps to imagine the context of the different shots. This kind of thing is easy to try but difficult to succeed. The film refuses to use the crutch of a kind to help the viewer little committed to understand what is happening. Instead, the film addresses and crosses a number of different genres. The thing to love the movie is to enjoy this playfulness. I guess 99% of North American viewers will simply not understand. If you try to define the narrative of this film, the philosophical message, the symbolist structure, etc., you will lose your time. There are not any. The film only pretends for these genres and others at times. The only unifying force of the film is the meaning that Claire Denis associates. There are so few feature films that satisfy Kant's description of what art is, the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself, rather than simply summarizing experiences under concepts. Film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simplest pleasure of understanding what's going on. Most movies are not art. Most movies do not approach art. As a film, like this one, is always appreciated by a wide range of viewers, this is a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I find the film too simplistic to yield to the various narrative threads that go through it. The father-son narrative of Tahiti, even if it is not exactly conventional, ends up making things a little clear and simple. He dominates too much.
