It's one of the few films I've seen twice at the theater. I really like this film for its atmosphere and its story of the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes a lot of mistakes but has a chance of redemption. Is not this a rather consoling thought? <br /> <br /> When I watched it for the first time, I thought that after the election won, the film would be over - I did not know the book. So, my boy, I was wrong when the dramatic climax was yet to arrive! The power of the last half hour of the film literally won me over. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie at all. I can not understand this single bit. Those who read the book first may be - as often with the adaptations of novels on screen - simply disappointed that so much has remained indescribable, invisible, unexplained. But as a film telling a touching story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the power of love and the madness of hate (and of conservatism) - this film is simply beautiful! Plus, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful too, especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> One of those films for which cinema was invented!
