What a good movie! Finally, an image revealing an unknown side of rock: the illusions of glory. Known rockers are aging and forgotten, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on rock around Bill Haley's clock? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best rock n'roll movie I've ever seen. Much better than Spinal Tap for example. Why? Because in Still Crazy, people are mature. They have a different point of view on rock, love and life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth that they miss so much. Beyond the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, their weaknesses and their dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Have a good time watching this (listen to the soundtrack!) and finally think about your future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
