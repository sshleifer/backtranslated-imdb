This film stars Emily Watson from the glory of Breaking the Waves. This film about the obsession of a man takes place in a station where a chess tournament takes place. A chess master arrives and soon after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by Emily Watson. She falls under the spell of this strange man, obsessed with chess. All this is to the dismay of her mother, who is much more interested in seeing her with another young man; a true gentleman. Her mother feels that it is only an ephemeral fantasy for the young woman, because she tends to take strange animals, etc. What follows is mainly a journey through the psyche of man. He tells how his past is closely related to his present. Emily Watson is amazing in this respect, as well as the actor who plays the main character. It's really slow, but it's worth watching. The end was even satisfying. :)
