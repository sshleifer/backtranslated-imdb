Despite a tight narration, Johnnie To's Election sometimes feels like a longer image, with many characters and plots abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of them are treated in the truly excellent and much superior suite, Election 2: Harmony is a virtue, but it's still a captivating thriller on a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootings and explosions (but not violence) in favor of ever-changing alliances that can transform the time needed to make a phone call. It is also a film where the most ruthless character is not always the most menacing character, as the frightening end clearly shows: one can imagine that a life of psychological counseling is necessary for all the trauma that the we inflict on an unfortunate passer-by. Simon Yam, too often a variable actor, but always at his best under the direction of To, has never been so successful, especially because the much more extroverted performance of Tony Leung makes his immobility even more powerful.
