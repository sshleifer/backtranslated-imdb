How does a regular day start at Point Place, Wisconsin ... <br /> <br /> First, Red, tyrannical father of the Forman family and World War II veteran, s sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his delighted wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then comes their skinny son, Eric, he is sitting at the table too, and his father starts shouting every day, usually involving placing his foot in Eric's back if (insert the reason here). If her sister Laurie with a promiscuous angel face is at home, she arrives, then Red stops shouting and talks to her kindly, making Eric feel excluded from the family. <br /> <br /> Once this ritual daily (painful) It's over, Eric rushes into his basement where all his friends are already present. And when we see them, it becomes obvious that Eric and his red-haired boyfriend, his neighbor next door and his childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the healthiest people there are. Meet Steven Hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and does not really care what happens because he's not funny to watch; Michael Kelso, the kind of guy who thinks he will only live by his appearance and that carrots grow in trees; Jackie Burkhardt, the one who considers herself the prettiest girl in the area, spoiled by a rich father and of course, a cheerleader; and Fez, a naive but excessive stranger who loves sweets and can not keep a secret. At first, they just hang around chatting and mocking Kelso, then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin ... before going out to do something they will regret later. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Red goes out and meets Donna's strange parents, Bob and Midge. It's rude, but it does not bother them because they think it's joking. Somewhere is Leo, an aging hippie, who is constantly confused and plays words without even realizing it. <br /> <br /> Have you imagined this seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? Of course, most seem "clich√©s", but the series takes the picture to a new level. Now, take a look at the worst stories the sitcom has to offer, sit back and enjoy one of the best TV shows of all time. One who never does the same thing twice and who is, compared to most sitcoms who are "cute funny", purely hysterical. If you become addicted, do not let this show let you go. Bite the hook again and again and, man, you'll see the sitcom kind of a whole new perspective.
