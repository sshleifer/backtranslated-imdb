I recently caught up with this little gem of cable film. It took me by surprise, although I should have expected it from the team involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell made this film with a sure hand, and it shows. We always wonder about the secret life of the killers to the rescue. It is not necessary to go too far to realize that they are probably his own neighbors, his social acquaintances or even his friends. they are not different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone at the right price. He has no scruples in teaching the tricks of the trade to his own son, and even to his grandson! <br /> <br /> Alex is a man who lives in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly begins to realize the consequences of his actions. He must see someone to help him find peace with himself. When he goes to Dr. Parks, he tries to find absolution, although he does not find it there. On the contrary, Alex discovers who is supposed to kill then. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly described by William H. Macy, hypnotizes us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe he is this man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. He is just as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who reveals the mystery. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, because the grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah. It shows an incredible ability and reach. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the woman who suffers, and she does not do much. Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother of hell. David Dorfman, is a delight in the movie. He shows maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
