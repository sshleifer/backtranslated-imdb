At the time, the film was controversial (like most of Verhoeven's projects). <br /> <br /> Containing very graphic representations of scenes of death; A parachute that does not open the body of * smack * guy on the floor. A guy is eaten by a lion * chomp * teeth in the throat. And a guy getting run over by a speedboat * zoom * bloody corpse coming down. <br /> <br /> But in addition to gore, this film also contains some brilliant scenes (and surprisingly beautiful), filmed in the gray city of the fisherman Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flying above the screen, in a part of the film irrelevant, a beautiful woman (saint) putting flowers in a pot of milk, surrounded by pieces of meat Scorching love scene between two male characters in a cemetery. <br /> <br /> The story ends with 10 minutes frenetic but rewarding, that do not disappoint and you will grow a sigh of relief. <br /> <br /> Of course, the benefits come with the disadvantages. Some special effects are too large and are obviously designed to determine how far Verhoeven could push the gore factor (eg the many hanging eyeballs). their catch). Moreover, while the two main actors (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) do an excellent job of bringing their characters to life, the character of Herman (described by the non-charming Thom Hoffman) feels enormously underdeveloped, making him difficult to treat, even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I did my best to give you a little idea of ​​what to expect from this amazing movie, and as you can see, it's not easy to summarize in words. So do yourself a favor, if you happen to find this movie somewhere, look at it! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
