Home Room really surprised me. Compared with other films written on Columbine High School, this one is the best. Home Room does not show the school shootings, but rather the consequences and effects of the community and the city. The film focuses on two opposing characters: Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an excluded who witnessed all the shooting. She seems to show no emotion about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital to graduate. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Alecia, who might have known that the shooting was about to take place. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get along well at first. Finally, they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (a lot in the style of the breakfast club). Home Room admirably shows the power of closeness and excitement after a shootout at a school. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
