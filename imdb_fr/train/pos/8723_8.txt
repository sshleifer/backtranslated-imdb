The entertainment was fabulous and the movie funny. The two bugs of the circus, Tuck / Roll were very funny. If you waited for the credits at the end, you saw a very funny movie sequence in which they showed bugs pretending to do the wrong thing like in other movies. It was clever because it made the characters more human and more credible.
