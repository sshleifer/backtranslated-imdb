"Broken Bow" takes us back to where it all started. Define 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchise is, in my opinion, the first series since "TOS" to recapture the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "Go where no man has gone before". Scott Bakula is perfectly interpreted by Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the cast are truly showing respect for Star Trek's legacy. John Billingsley is brilliant as a foreigner, Dr. Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is totally seductive as a tempting but logical scientist Vulcan, T'Pol. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best first episode of the Treks, and I believe that Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud.
