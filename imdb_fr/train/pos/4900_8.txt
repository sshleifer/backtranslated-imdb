It's an original film that the British do so well. Small budgets, cameo-like roles, well done. The story is a little weak, a widow recently widowed, Judi Dench, decides to collect the "blond bombs" of a group of girls composed of (almost all) girls who played during the war in London. I liked how the film shows young people that they do not have the monopoly of feelings, love and even lust! That "old wrinkles" can laugh as well. Judi Dench was beautiful as always, shame Do not see more of other "blonde bombs", I thought the end was a bit rushed. I kept thinking that David Jason would have made Patrick even better than Ian Holm, even though he was quite adequate as a drummer. Overall, a gay movie was well worth a night with the girls :)
