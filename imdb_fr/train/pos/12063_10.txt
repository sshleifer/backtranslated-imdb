The Woman in Black (1989) is a televised adaptation of Susan Hill's classic ghost story, published only a few years before filming. Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD and, as far as I know, it was deleted in VHS. Its availability is in direct contrast to its popularity among connoisseurs of horror movies. The story revolves around events in a seaside community of the early twentieth century, when a law firm is sent by his firm to close the affairs of a deceased widow, deceased in his isolated area of ​​the swamps. What he thought was a routine and probably a tedious task turned into a nightmare when he discovered that the old woman was haunted until her death and that the ghosts of her past do not just rest. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, without ever being complacent, flashy or overly exposing. The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the realistic approach, but that is exactly what history needs and why it works so well. That's what you do not see that scares. That said, there is a particularly terrifying scene that is visual and works perfectly. I watched this movie during the day and still had nightmares about a week later. If you like to be terrified, do what you need to buy and watch a copy of The Woman In Black.
