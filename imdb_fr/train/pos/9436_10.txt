"It all depends on you, Ed?" "Now you have to play the game." The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this movie with his new girlfriend on opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I was not quite sure what I was seeing, but I will never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. <br /> <br /> Looking at it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me earthquakes. <br /> <br /> My father was a big fan of Burt Reynolds, hence the need to queue for almost an hour to watch what was supposed to be an action movie. Previously, I had already seen two films at the Dome: "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway". It was not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked. <br /> <br /> But even at this tender age, I have always appreciated artistic talent ... and having reviewed today, I am surprised film disturbing, but extremely well designed. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a 14 year old who has not kissed his first girlfriend yet. I do not blame my father for taking me away, but it was a bit too much for a child to testify. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I always find it quite disturbing, but I am always very impressed by the quality of the film's production. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds as an absolute marvel, as well as all the principles ... of Billy Redden as a hybrid guitar marvel to Ronny Cox as a terrified insurance salesman ... everyone does a job admirable. The sound quality is unmatched, from chirping birds to ticking clocks. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate. <br /> <br /> The moral issues that arise, from the murder of sexual assailants to the consequences of killing a human being, remain profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was published. And the classic sequences of attempts at survival in nature after facing such unexpected brutality are crucial. These four men, city dwellers, suddenly confronted with a situation never imagined, raise the challenge of the action to horror. <br /> <br /> It's a classic, of course. And the phrase "you have a pretty mouth" has been quoted ad infinitum, from Saturday Night Live to the improvised comments around the water fountain at work, this film is undoubtedly a huge part of our societal pop culture. .. as much as "Make my day" or "I'll be back" never been. <br /> <br /> So what would you do if you found your friends sexually abused by mountain men away from your life in town, cozy bed, wife and kids? And if you took the steps that Burt Reynolds took (and I would have), would you bury your body under the lake, or if you were on trial and try your luck? The bottom line is: Deliverance book. You can bring that to the bank. If this film does not hurt you, you are not human. <br /> <br /> Even if you've seen it before, rent it again and ask yourself the question above. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is the same: Ed failed to kill the deer ... then changed. Life and its unpredictable circumstances can change a man. And I guess that's what this movie has to do with Jon Voight, especially, like Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his much underrated performance of Franklin D. Roosevelt to Pearl Harbor, his game taking the film to another level. Climb the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right. You have to see it to believe it. I guarantee that your heart rate will increase to a new level. <br /> <br /> A quick rhythm, tense, tense and closely traced like a banjo string, it's a game of morality that asks questions that remain today. Times have changed, but our choices as human beings have not been. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
