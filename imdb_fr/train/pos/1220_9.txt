Origins of Bisounours and their cousins. If you have seen the original movie, you will notice a difference. Cousins ​​are raised with Care Bears rather than meeting them later. However, this is not a problem for me, preferring to treat movies as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and it's fun to watch them play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a deliciously menacing shapeshifter. I could understand the three children because I was not good either in sport. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love toys or enjoy the original, do not miss this opportunity. 9/10
