An excellent example of the spectacular musicals of Busby Berkeley produced in the early 1930s. The audience must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. A contrast with his "Public Enemy" 2 years ago. Cagney adds spark and interest to an invented script and script. But the highlight of the film is the 3 production numbers that follow each other. First with the conservative number "Honeymoon Hotel", followed by the dazzling sequence "By A Waterfall", followed by the closing sequence "Shanghai Lil", Cagney only takes part in the last issue sabotaging her top of a bar Counter with Ruby Keeler. The number "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is excellent but a little comical and anti-soothing after the most exciting and incredibly breathtaking choreography "By A Waterfall". If I was the director, I would have inserted the number "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and near "By A Waterfall", which eliminates the other two figures of water so to speak and in my opinion the best of 3 figures. The 3 production numbers are the icing on the cake and the performance of James Cagney is added to the decoration of the cake. An exceptional musical achievement, a 4-star film, the ultimate musical, worth watching, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
