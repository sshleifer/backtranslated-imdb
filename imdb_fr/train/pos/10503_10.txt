When I first got my N64 at the age of five or six, I fell in love with it and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved it! The graphics were perfect for the moment, a good plot, great course and much more, the best music I heard in a Nintendo game. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the plot completely, but I think Princess Peach has been kidnapped by Bowser and Mario has to rescue her. The game consists of getting 120 stars from the castle's curses.They had about five or six challenges to get the stars.There are secret parts of the castle, where you can get more stars.But of course, you beat Bowser . * I think there are three levels to beat Bowser * Let's start with the characters. Mario is the main character and he gets useful tips from Toad. So it's one of your only alliances. I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game. The main villain is Bowser, and there are many other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. <br /> <br /> Then, what about people say that the gameplay is more important than the graphics, and I totally agree.But with the great plot, there are great graphics. Especially for the moment.I have many other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics do not compare to Super Mario.Vivid colors, great sound effects and impressive sound effects.I found the graphics of the courses of very good water. Beside the world Bowser, it has the best graphics of the game. <br /> <br /> Now the music. This is my favorite part of the game. Growing up, when I played there at a very young age, I gladly left the game all night long for the music to make me sleepy. Especially the music of Jolly Roger Bay, who was peaceful and beautiful . There are others that are great too, especially in Bowser, once again, in the world, those are the ones that are most important to me and my favorites. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite hobby as a developing player and I love this game. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) GO TO PLAY!
