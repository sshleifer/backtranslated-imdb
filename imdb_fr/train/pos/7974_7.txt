I found that this film was the usual French slap in the face of America. The camera, too often, focuses on fat people, dilapidated houses and dilapidated rural areas. While the narrative seems to sympathize and admire the people of the small town that are presented to the viewer, the cinematography exploits and belittles them. There were no doubt thin people in Glencoe and tidy and organized houses, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what there was to see. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal to the American public its worst elements. I can assure you, as a frequent visitor to France, that all is not well there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, which creates serious social inequalities. But the Americans are in no hurry to unmask the French for their prejudices against their own compatriots and their jealousy towards the United States. It is therefore unlikely that we will see movies on the subject.
