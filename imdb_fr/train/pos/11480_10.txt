Kickoff Hunting: This is one of the most amazing and intense movies I've seen in a long time. The first film in the years that left me absolutely stupefied. I was barely able to get out of the theater, I was so upset. <br /> <br /> I've been watching the screen for about fifteen minutes to try to find a way to describe the power of this movie, and just fail. Highlighting one aspect of it - the documentary-style video log format, the flawless representation of events, the strength of the characters - just seems to trivialize it all. Some may find it laughable that any killer can be described as normal. But then all the killers are not crazy fools who smoke in the mouth. Many are quite regular and unpretentious people. They are simply wired differently. <br /> <br /> And this is perhaps the most scary thought of all.
