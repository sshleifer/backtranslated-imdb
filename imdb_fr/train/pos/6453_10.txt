The arrival of a world-renowned conductor creates unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he manages the church choir and by the progressive change of the people who compose it. This film is comforting and makes you come out of the cinema with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes. Kay Pollak wrote an excellent script based on the ideas for which he became so famous. The actors are exceptional, we already knew Michael Nyqvist, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance for me. She has a very lively face that leaves no one indifferent. Per Moberg plays his role as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he's awful too. We would like him to be behind the scenes so that he plays a good guy one day so we can see if he also masters that character. <br /> <br /> It's a film that will not leave you indifferent. If you have not already seen it, do it today!
