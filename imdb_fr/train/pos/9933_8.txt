If you find yourself in need of escape, something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to get lost in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. It's fun, after all! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) where you want to see it a second time to understand everything. I wondered about Domino Harvey herself and the fact that her life has attracted the interest of Hollywood. As far as acting is concerned, many celebrity appearances do not appear in the trailers. And any actor who makes me forget who he is has done his job well. Not once did I think of Kiera wearing a football uniform or pirate suit. And then, of course, Mickey Rourke plays well and often in Mickey Rourke, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being able to take care of other people.
