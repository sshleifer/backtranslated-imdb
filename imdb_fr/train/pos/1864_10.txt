I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What awesome movie and amazing young man. This film is a must for anyone struggling to overcome abuse and abandoning their childhood to adulthood. Denzel Washington achieves an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert - Feel good and in tears. The most heartbreaking moment is when he finally meets his mother, to whom he was abducted at the age of 2 months. And one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and I would just like to know about it years ago. Certainly a movie to add to my DVD collection.
