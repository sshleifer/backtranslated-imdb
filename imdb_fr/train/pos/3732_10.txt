Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed "Phone Booth", '02 and many other great movies showed in detail how no one can really be trained to be a killing machine without destroying one's own personality and the real fears that a person to face when entering the fight !! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", 2003, achieved one of his best performances and carried this picture in his back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush", '02, gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All Real Girls," '03, showed his true acting skills in the role he played. There were two brief scenes in which the soldiers were able to find a romance during a brief holiday in the local town and had to pay for their sexual love and desires. A veteran Vietnamese Army instructor told the soldiers how to actually torture the enemy by using electrical wires in the wrong places of a human body. Pleasant and entertaining film to see.
