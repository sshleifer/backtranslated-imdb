This film came and went to the theaters. Because of its nature, you can see why it was not well received. He was filmed unfairly because of his subject more than the film itself. Higher Learning is not spectacular but it's a good movie that has tried to talk about a dreaded topic in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Intrigue / History: Higher Learning is mainly centered on Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive star of the track who has to cope with not being fast enough, and a stern teacher (played by Laurence Fishburne). He befriends Fudge (Ice Cube) and a gorgeous woman named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later, they have to deal with skinheads on campus. Remy (Michael Rapaport's play) is a confused kid who ends up befriending local skinheads on campus. Once they impose their point of view, he becomes as racist as they are. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Higher education is not without flaws: character development is rare, well played by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader of skinheads (whose name I have forgotten) , Busta Rhymes does not fit in this movie at all. In addition, the clich√© preceded the fact that women became homosexuals after being abused by men. So you know I did not like this part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Apart from that, this movie was not bad at all. Laurence Fishburne was good as a Phipps teacher (although I could do without the accent), Fudge was the best performance of Ice Cube and Michael Rapaport was good as Remy confused. All in all, it was one of John Singleton's best movies, and that's one of the reasons I frown at the garbage he puts on now. The cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy, 2 Furious Fast 2 and a very useless remake of Shaft.
