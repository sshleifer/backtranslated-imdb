I first saw this movie as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal reigned over the world. Trick Or Treat has all the elements for a rocking film. With a cast that features Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons from Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? Upset messages played on vinyl! Yes that's right, they use discs in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a message from the evil rock star on her turntable when the situation starts to scare. The monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed. As a teenager, I tried to read my discs upside down hoping it would happen to mine. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite movies.
