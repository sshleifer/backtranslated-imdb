A very good adaptation of the novel of Amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpai did their best. <br /> <br /> The film has a natural flair and I have felt it to the end. It seems that Bollywood has finally given up its glamor and that some quality artists are appearing on the screen. <br /> <br /> In terms of content, the film describes exactly what happened during the score by showing the suffering of a particular family and this confidence in life goes beyond religion . <br /> <br /> The best part was that they were not making a drama with a lot of tears and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved him.
