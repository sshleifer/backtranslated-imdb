A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed that he loses his perspective and common sense. An evil magician approaches him and informs him that he can give her a great wealth that he can use to win the heart of the woman IF he agrees to give him everything he wants in his room. The stupid guy accepts and the magician removes the reflection of the man in the mirror - it naturally results in bad things. <br /> <br /> If this film was shot a decade later, I'm sure I was not so charitable when editing and noting this film. After all, the plot of the film is a little vague in places and the acting is sometimes a little scalded. However, when you consider that in 1913, "complete" films were rare - and often only lasted 20 to 30 minutes! In addition, the idea of ​​a complex story like the one you have in this film is very unusual, because the stories were very short and played widely. So, given the time limitations, this movie is very good and is one of the first horror movies known.
