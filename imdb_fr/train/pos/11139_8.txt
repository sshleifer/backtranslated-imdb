The pursuit of the copper ring by a na√Øve tracker (JON VOIGT) and his imbecile rogue sidekick (DUSTIN Hoffman) should not dream, it must soon build a friendship based on the basic techniques of survival. <br /> A bold film for its time, and a major example of the kind of rugged landscape that is explored in the more graphic movies of the 60s. Symbol of the "end of innocence" in American movies , since it is the only X rated film to win the Oscar for best film. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is the male merchant who expects the big city finds an easy way for women to make money when they are fighting for his body, but quickly discovers that the city is a cold place without carpets for him. Coupled with a lame crook (DUSTIN Hoffman), he embarks on a series of sero-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the confines of cold water for the promised sun in Florida, a land that his friend "Ratzo" dreams of living there. <br /> <br /> But even in this final quest, both are losers. John Schlesinger has finely crafted a brilliant Waldo Salt script, and John Barry's obsessive theme of "Midnight Cowboy" adds to the poignant moments of search and despair. <br /> <br /> In summary: a true American classic that faces honestly difficult and daring subject to show the underside of some aspects of urban life.
