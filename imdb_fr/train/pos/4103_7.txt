The main characters of this film belong to two categories: intelligent and stupid. Quite simple. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays the role of an unfortunate dopey who is arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to be financially reimbursed by his former boss nasty, the situation becomes uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> While Standa is truly (but endearingly) stupid, her boyfriend Ondrej is an absolute idiot who blocks everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa might have a chance to go through life with some success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but certainly not without headaches! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, a type of evil genius who degenerates into a delirious tyrant inspired by Hitler. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to protect Zdenek's secrets. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed by the quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic has certainly produced more than its share of superb entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two films, you have already seen the best of Czech cinema.
