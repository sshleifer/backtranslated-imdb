I wanted to see this movie for a few months. In fact, I was surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of high school teens bullying a boy named Marty. They brutalize him constantly until one of them makes a horrible mistake that leaves Marty horribly burned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers is invited to return to their high school, now abandoned for a month. Party. However, none of the reckless teenagers organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, teens begin to die in the most macabre way. I can certainly tell you that they are also bloody. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, you discover that all this was a dream and none of that happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not take place, burns and jokes apparently occurred. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> I like history. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). Tyrants get what happens to them at the end and you end up feeling satisfied with the victim who takes his sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend anyone to take it if you are looking for 80s slashers. <Br/> <br /> I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars. Good cheese slasher!
