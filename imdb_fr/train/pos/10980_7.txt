I saw this film a few weeks ago and it has been in my head ever since. It features two mesmerizing characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary. To understand the true story of the Beales, I had to go through all the bonuses, reviews and reviews of the DVD, and then search the web. <br /> <br /> Although the Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edie themselves) bristle at the suggestion that this movie is an exploitation, it's a exploitation in the true sense of the word . There is very little effort to explain the Beales or how they found themselves in the state they were in - the Maysles approach seems to be just turning on the camera and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something. 'horrible. The sound, even during the re-release of Criterion, is weak and hard to follow. Although I appreciate the fact that this film was made a bit early in the history of documentary, it is ironic to compare it to the series (!) De Geraldo Rivera (!), Far superior, on sexual abuse of patients with intellectual disabilities at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island from 1972 to four years. Before Gray Gardens is shot down. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a criticism in the New Yorker, Edith and Edie needed a lot of things in their lives, and no documentary was part of it. <br /> <As for Edith and Edie, the thing I thought about while watching the movie was "Where the hell is their family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy and dangerous conditions. How is it that Jackie O, married to one of the richest men in the world (or to the wealthy Bouvier family herself), can not afford Edith and Edie a decent house? Or at the very least hire a housekeeper or a part-time caregiver to watch them both? It is shameful and a lasting shame for the entire Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this opinion may seem negative, I would highly recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who loves documentaries. Maybe someday someone will make a documentary about this documentary - introducing the rich history (and history) of the Beales and the entire subsection of Hamptons society in the 1970s.
