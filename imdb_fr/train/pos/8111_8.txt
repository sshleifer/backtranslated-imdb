Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; at once an essay on the destructive character of war and the terrors of progress. This gives surprising and accurate representations of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is terribly naive in its utopian ideals. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson form a beautiful cast, although the drama is played more like a play than a movie. There are grandiose speeches, although slightly elevated, often pronounced as if the actor was trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words there. Is technology the savior of humanity or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual treat, if one can detach oneself from the age of effects. Of course, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely so inventive. For the creator, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, huge deco bombers, space guns, gyroscopes and secret organizations of scientific saviors. It has everything you need for a science fiction adventure, but instead uses the attributes of a philosophical exercise. <br /> <br /> What was happening and Metropolis were the watchwords of Neolithic science fiction cinema in Hollywood. They have a lyrical scope and are visually inspiring. Technology has long neglected them, but their ideas have exploded. There is an art here, with more heart and emotion than today's mass-produced computer cinema. These films are the product of artisans and not industrialists.
