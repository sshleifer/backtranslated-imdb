Nowadays, we mostly remember Spielberg's "The Color Purple" for being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning the zilch. What is even more alarming is that Spielberg himself was not named Best Director. Needless to say, filmmakers deserved more praise than the ones they were given. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous. father and then by her violent husband. The film spans several years and focuses on Celie's relationship with the women around her. It is told from a resolutely feminine point of view, but you do not have to fear that it is a film of saccharine chicks. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, sometimes animated with humor even if the struggles of the central character are paramount. Some people may not appreciate the change of tone towards the end of the film, but that did not bother me, even if similar content in a smaller film would probably make me roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film has received three Oscar nominations for its acting. : Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Actress in a Supporting Role) and Margaret Avery (Best Actress in a Supporting Role). I think Goldberg and Winfrey certainly deserved and Danny Glover was inextricably stiff. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg was not named best director for his efforts. Such an omission belies the conviction, since the management of Spielberg is excellent. I am not particularly crazy about the Quincy Jones score, but it is by no means below average. <br /> <br /> The story is finally satisfactory, well told by a master-director working at Pulitzer. Award winning material. Try it and you will probably be as confused as me by the way it could be so badly treated the night of the Oscars.
