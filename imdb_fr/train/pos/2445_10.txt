I really like this show. That's why I was disappointed to learn recently that George Lopez was a racist and that he fired Masiela Lusha from the series simply because he discovered that she was not a Latin American émigré, but an emigrant from Albania. I learned this from the people in the series. She was really one of the best parts of the series and therefore to learn that even among those who, in your opinion, would be sensitive to racism, they can also hate someone, simply because of the country where they were born. disappointing.
