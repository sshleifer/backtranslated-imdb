After all these years, after the brilliant and expensive donation of his soul, film after film, finally, Hollywood gives him an Oscar recently. <br /> <br /> Country Dance arrived late one night, and of course, blew me away from my complaining niche in my so-called "life". How is it? <br /> <br /> York is also brilliant in this kind of game. The two psychological battleships loaded for the bear .... <br /> <br /> Bravo to the author, the director, the distribution and to the film crew. No wonder the Nazis lost to these Irish, Scottish and English mixes ... the brutal honesty hurts ... in the '70s, when I personally thought that "honesty" was pure and absolutely essential to the trust. I have changed my extreme nerves and I will be content with more human and warm defects in myself and others. <br /> <br /> Forgiveness allows humanity to backtrack and allows us to repair our own egos and erotic heads of errors ....
