IN THE LOVELY MEMORY OF DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first saw this film, I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this story of witches during the Second World War. The scene that impressed me the most was the fight between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was exceptional to see this army without body walking to fight the astonished singing their march. This film is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which has become for me the most fantastic place in London) to the trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. She is always great, it seems that the good aunt of a family and David with his face still astonished is his big co-protagonist. we will miss him very much.
