The opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission, Cheech and Chong dragging this large bin on the parking lot, filled with gasoline. "Do not overthrow the man!", Hilarious stuff. And then, as the "plot" ensues, you're ready for a hell of a walk. I watched this movie recently and it holds up, being just as funny at every viewing. Check it out.
