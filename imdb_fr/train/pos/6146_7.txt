Maybe Disney was hoping to have another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story and if Angela is charming, she was a very different performer from the brilliant Julie Andrews. That said, Lansbury is a perfect cast and offers a magical performance. His character has something deliciously delicate and David Tomlinson supports him wonderfully. Tomilinson can wear a melody but he is certainly not very chop as a singer. It does not matter if he's such a talented actor you'll barely notice. Roddy McDowel giving a winning performance and very dear Tessie OShea doing very little, but it's nice to see the old maid again. It is also nice to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The score contains some beautiful songs, including The Salt Sea and The Age of Not Believing. The big number Portabello Road is stretched to the extreme but it has a lot of theatricality. The effects seem a little clich√© today, but the scene with the German invaders attacked by the craziest army of the cinema is quite impressive. Children are not as annoying as other movies, but it's hard to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the march song of the local army. Housekeeping was very important to Britain and it's a warm tribute. The animation is delicious, much better than Pixar that I find grotesque. A hot and happy film and it's a wonder that it's not done on stage.
