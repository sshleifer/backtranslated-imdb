As in heaven {SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> It was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable about the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a top talented musician, physically and mentally exhausted by his career and must give it up. When he joined a church choir as a cantor, he brought a transformation in the lives of choristers, just as Jesus did to society in first century Palestine. They laugh, they begin to talk to each other openly and honestly, their faults are exposed, they accept each other, love each other, become a vital community. They include the mentally handicapped young man (? Tore), such are their inclusivity. <br /> <br /> Pastor Stig exercised his authority by imposing a stifling morality on the congregation, which the choristers gradually rejected. When Stig returns Daniel, he rebels and Stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of Jesus' day, whose insistence on obeying Jewish law offered a striking contrast to the new life of the "golden rule" imposed by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone declares "the church has invented sin". Throughout the film, there is this contrast between the moral-ism and the vital life (being). <br /> <br /> Faithful to the story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Conny, when he beats him, lets him drown in the river. Next scene, it is difficult to believe when the body of Daniel (resurrected!) Is dragged to his room (the tomb) draped in a sheet of white linen (the shroud!), By three women (three women were watching the foot of the cross in the gospel). <br /> <br /> Daniel is closely related to Lena, a beautiful and warm young woman who was betrayed by a man she loved and who is now promiscuous (Jesus has developed a close relationship with Mary Magdalene - Lena - who was probably a high class prostitute / prostitute). Thanks to Lena, Daniel learns to love, something he longed for and now finds fulfillment. <br /> <br /> The solo sung by Gabriella, composed by Daniel, consists of leading a busy life, contrary to moral accuracy. it leads to worry about sin and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows the choir singing / buzzing in harmony, like a mantra, attracting a wide audience, illustrating the harmony and interdependence that make up our true human destiny.
