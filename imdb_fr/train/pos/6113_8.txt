After seeing "Marrying Mafia", I almost lost confidence in the world of Korean cinema. But this one brought me back my faith. <br /> <br /> Leading character, university student, forced to teach spoiled high school student, rich but charismatic. It is actually the age of the female character. After some hilarious quarrels, these two end up being great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to see that newcomer kwan sang woo and did his job with excellence. He was such a revelation !! Actress Kim Ha Nobody was as charming as usual. <br /> <br /> This film has tried to avoid the clich√©s that are found in typical romantic comedies. And that did not show us naked and useless sex scenes. It was great, charming, fresh, made me want to see him again. <br /> <br />
