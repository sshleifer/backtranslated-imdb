Do not look for overdeveloped intrigue here .... relax with popcorn and enjoy this one. A star gallery appears as the villains of the classic cartoon character in this live action comedy, which features incredible makeup and scenery, not to mention the unprecedented performances of Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Very fun for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
