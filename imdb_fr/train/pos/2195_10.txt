I liked it! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, saxophonist a little conceited, proud and at the same time very vulnerable and in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), always at his side. They meet in Panama after Maggie's landing and meet at a bar with Anthony Quinn. After insulting Maggie, Tony was punched in the nose as a cowardly woman - all because she took off her hat in public. Big fight and Maggie gets stuck in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur go well together. Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her. She pushes him to go to NY where (watch the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in her arms as he plays the saxophone. I really recommend it.
