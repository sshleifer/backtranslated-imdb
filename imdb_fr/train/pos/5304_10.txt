Pecker is a funny and distorting film about a small town in Baltimore whose daily routine is interrupted by Pecker, a young photographer taking pictures of "real things". No pretty models, no beautiful men, just a difficult life. This wonderful film makes fun of the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is a particular scene in which a homeless woman who shops in the bargain shop of Pecker's mother buys the same coat as one of Whitney's art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. It just shows you that no matter what kind of money you have, you may not always like it. Once again, John Waters sends you into an endless spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your traditional Hollywood movies with special effects and celebrity mountains, but give me a "Pecker" or a "Hairspray" (another great John Waters movie) on a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla"! !
