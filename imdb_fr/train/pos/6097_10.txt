I do not see how one can say that Freddy's nightmares are tacky and stolen. Obviously, you do not know television well when you see it. The episodes are filled with drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's nightmares and I hope to have the 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series is nil, then you are entitled to your opinion, but remember that this is just your opinion and it means nothing. Freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series of all time and you will soon accept it. If you do not like it, then do not look at it, but do not deny its brilliance.
