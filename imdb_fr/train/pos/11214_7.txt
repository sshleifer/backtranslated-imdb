It was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw, I think in a $ 2 movie theater along the Hollywood Blvd. so I had no reference to the first payment made by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked by the corrupt McNairy County system and the brutality of the "redneck gangs". I was also surprised by the fact that a man decided not to let him slip and went to do something about it. Courageous ? I thought so, to the point of giving me chills in the back. <br /> <br /> I think this film is a beautiful story about the courage of the United States to defend and do something for a system that serves only their own interests. I was pretty blown away about it and I think it's still one of the best movies of the hero / anti-hero genre, which can make you laugh but includes recent movies like "The Punisher", but even more so because that it is a true story. The recent remake featuring "Rock" does not do justice to the real fire of Buford Pusser's story. <br /> <br /> A "classic" which, I am sure, will resurface in the future.
