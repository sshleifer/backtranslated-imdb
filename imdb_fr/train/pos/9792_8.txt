Once a year "comes" a movie like this and makes your life easier. You have not made the effort to think it's good, it's just. You appreciate it by watching it and taking it home. I can not say it's totally flawless, but it's close. Play - awesome, interesting, with elements of suspense. It's a little family story, quite predictable, but it's not the secret that counts. that's the way it is for the blind to reach it. I was impressed by the way the director described their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like was the actress who played the mother, she was too hard and unnecessary. Keren
