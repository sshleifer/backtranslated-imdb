Cameron Grant is one of the best film directors for adults. His only rival is Andrew Blake. Celeste is dynamited throughout the film but the DR's desktop sequence with her and her two other ladies is simply amazing. Asia Carrera's performance with the construction worker is almost as good. I highly recommend this movie and gave it a 9. It's almost as good as Cameron Grant's ELEMENTS OF DESIRE I gave a 10.
