This is an excellent fast-paced thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street) that, for 85 minutes, leaves out the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying: the evil of human beings. We are much more likely to encounter Jackson Rippner's benign evil than Freddy Kruger and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does a great job in portraying a sociable, friendly, even charismatic murderer. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, of The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film takes place at a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is a small-scale action, not the broad expanse of the canvas, and it is no less convincing for these limitations. Cinematography is nothing special, although, of course, you can not do more with a camera in the confines of a jet plane, but the dialogue is excellent, the story tense. There are no distractions, no subplots confuse the issue that is at the heart of a battle between the main characters. By staying focused and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turn it into an exciting and fast action thriller.
