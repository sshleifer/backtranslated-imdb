I have not read Kurt Vonnegut's book yet, but I know some of his other works and I'm curious to see how it will be translated on screen. Overall, I think it's a very successful adaptation of a Vonnegut novel. This is the story of an American living in Germany recruited as a spy for the United States. His job is to make friends with high-ranking Nazis and send secret messages to Americans via his weekly radio show. But when the war ends, he is considered a war criminal, but he fled to New York, where several strange intrigues are expected. <br /> <br /> If Mother Night has a problem, it's because it tends to be a little too sentimental at times. But for most of the film, the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot unfolds with skill and aplomb. And there are fabulous dark comedy moments involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a high-ranking Nazi in a prison cell. Very recommended.
