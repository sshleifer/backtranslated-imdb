I was probably one of the few Australians not to watch tennis during the broadcast of this series. I must say that when William McInnes appeared for the first time, he's a shitty actor! But as the series continued, he diminished his performance and I totally loved him. He was a rotten guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers play a kind and calm man and even more interesting to see the wavy muscles of Tom Longs! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role and the main actress played an entertaining performance. I would recommend this program if you like disturbing stories and watch Tom Long walk around without a shirt ...
