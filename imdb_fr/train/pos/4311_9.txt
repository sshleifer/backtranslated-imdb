This work concerns less the character of Steve Martin, Davis, than that of Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue inserted via Davis is an existentialism that is both contemplative, contemplative and almost poetic. . He is spiritual, intelligent and thoughtful in the delivery and content of the dialogue. The writers deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The performances are easy, relaxed and natural; exactly what you expect from actors of "A List". Martin contributes to the performance that leads to his latest Shopgirl, guiding you through life, love and the pursuit of wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is the fifth - the tailor - the conformist of the film and, as such, his performance is clear and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This book deals with life in all its aspects. This engenders a real emotional investment in his characters and lets you hope that humanity is not doomed to fail, no matter what you believe, deep inside you. <br /> <br /> Overall? It's delicious, with one or two difficult moments, and an easy natural dialogue that draws you in, helping your audience fully enjoy this work. It's definitely worth it, although it may not be everyone's first choice as a Friday / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really appreciated the intelligence of this exhibition. This is not typical and was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty exposed here. Couples and friends have detailed conversations, which feel and sound completely honest and (yet) natural. I was very impressed by this work and will soon add it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> He scores a 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
