Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to find, its length is now standard and you have it long enough without it. (When the personal video started, there were at least three versions with missing parts ..) Everything you read is true. There is no defense, and no life without it. The color is lush and beautiful to watch, and the production values ​​are pretty good for an epic Saturday afternoon for kids. But no question .. the whole Santa Vs.The angle of Satan is so amazing that STRANGE made the movie a hit at the time and a very popular cult movie once for the house. How good / bad / strange / is it? I only saw the trailer as a kid and remembered computing for almost 30 years ... including Murray's exquisite voice. a movie where Santa vs. Satan .. Add to that things like Santa asking the blessing of the Virgin Mary before leaving on Christmas Eve, children wanting to capture him and make him their slave..and an international sweat store for kids .. and it probably comes with a lot of nightmares that children had in the 60's. Like others here, I look at the thing every holiday season now. (My favorite version is The Mystery Science Theater 3000). But whatever the method chosen, the film is a crazy masterpiece and a must (with Brianiac, by the way ...). He never fails to make me laugh. Better, I think, that SANTA CLAUS CONQUERED THE MARTIANS. Some parts may still make you cringe or scare you. (How many parents do you know going out for a cocktail party on Christmas Eve? "If you're bored, just go down and play the piano." DANG ..) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, childlike, weird..they do you want more?
