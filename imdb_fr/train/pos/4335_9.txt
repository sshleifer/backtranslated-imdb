Oscar-like interpretation of Peter Falk in a written role. I loved the nuanced and nuanced exploration of a longtime marriage - how often do we have that in movies, where the film usually ends when boy and girl meet? It's an adult film, a complex vision through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how each has adapted to each other in the past and has grown over the course of time. history. On top of that, it gave me about 10 big belly laughs, and I'm one of those who sit without being amused when the rest of the audience laughs. It was one of the few really funny movies I saw. Super, original jokes.
