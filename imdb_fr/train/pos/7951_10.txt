It's a really nice and sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy. These are two dogs and a cat that are taken to live with someone else for a little while, but the animals do not understand and they escape and find their family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and it is aptly named. Chance is the young dog who knows a lot about life inside the pound. Shadow is the older and wiser dog who feels things. Put these three together in an adventure and it will make it a happy and fun moment. There are no special effects from the moving mouth, so it's not lame at all. It's the best talking animal movie I've seen so far. It's a very good movie for families.
