Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I am still a crazy-holic. It was just another movie that I watched in part on television. I then needed the video tape to finally know how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed the first signs of degradation after a few weeks. After the DVD, I had to get my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several movie posters and the movie script. Right now, it's getting worse that I'm trying to get other people to become addicted to my website and my still crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What led me to addiction? <br /> <br /> OK, this is one of those funny comedies that are both funny, but sad and melancholy that only the British can produce. <br /> <br /> All right, the movie is a world apart from things like "This Is Spinal Tap", because of the characters, who are neither childish nor ultra-cool, but real. It's also a story of aging men. A story of men getting along well. Or not. It contains some of the best possible actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy doing one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is amazing. Mick Jones, of Foreigner, wrote the songs for the fictional band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bassist Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, representing the egocentric but awkward singer, Ray Simms, really sings. We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you only heard Bill Nighy sing in "Love Actually," you have no idea of ​​the strength and power of his voice. <br /> <br /> Well, you'll get feverish for every upcoming scene for the tenth time, especially those concert scenes. You would die to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit does "All Over The World", singing loudly. You want to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at the Wisbech festival stadium. <br /> <br /> It's hard but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I am addicted to Strange Fruit. If there is a world where this group really exists, I would like to go there. <br /> <br /> Are you still mad ... someone?
