Does anyone know where I can see or download episodes of season 4 "What I like about you" on the internet? Because I would die to see them and here in Germany, we will not show anything on television. Help me please. I want to see the episodes of season 4 badly. I've already seen episodes 4 and 18 on YouTube. But I could not find more episodes of season 4. Is there a website where I can see the episodes? Because I read comments on German forums and there were people who had already seen the episodes of season 4 when they had not been broadcast on German television. I am happy with every information I can get. Thank you Kate
