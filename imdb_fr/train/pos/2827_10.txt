It's probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it's so good! It's probably best if you do not look at it expecting a startling plot and something fantastically intelligent and entertaining because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to watch Goro's 50 million vases and fantastic hair / bad English, you'll be thrilled. The more you think about the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a contest to spot as many holes as possible, in which case you'll have hours of entertainment to come. I would really recommend this movie only for tired or irreducible Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a little cautious, because the Japanese Goro fans were a little upset about it, they thought it was selling. (He was not really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do it for him).
