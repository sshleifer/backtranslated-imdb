This is a jewel, a real piece of Americana for all that it entails. If you are self-programmed to resist "life affirming" stories, just stay away and leave the rest of us who still believe in it. And what makes the icing on the cake really delectable is that it's a fact based on a true story of rags to riches, no need to choose what details have been changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the most energetic actors, and the complex and conflicting skills of his father could only be successful by someone with his talent and insight. The simple-minded comments, which refuse to accept a father who tries to enforce the law while having the feeling that he could possibly be late, expose the limits of the commentator, not the writers or the actors. It's not for the cynic or the simple mind.
