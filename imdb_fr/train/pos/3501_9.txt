One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is universally spectacular in a story of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York, the two protagonists being superstars in the making. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, it's a totally refreshing vision of urban youth that places the often nauseous shtick in the bottleneck it belongs ... even though I must admit that Bully was well above his usual rate . Raising Victor Vargas is a film you will miss ... so do not miss it!
