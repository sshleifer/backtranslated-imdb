It is a dramatic film in the broad sense of the word. This indicates to the queue that in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Of course, he has extremes .. but from time to time, the sorrow of real life goes beyond art. It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and of the whole social structure built around these goals. The film has a deeper understanding of lifestyles, stereotypes and the social structure of Greece. Unlike most Greek movies that have a certain target audience of fast food, this one does not target anyone in particular, but while you look at it, you feel that someone has put the best words and pictures possible to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music either, but I would not like to hear anything else when it was played during the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone told me to say something against this film, I would define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut. I guess the editing had to be cut for 2 hours and a bit for the theaters .. Anyway, I could write more and more to express my thought about it, but I guess you have to see it. and discuss it with a friend. A must see
