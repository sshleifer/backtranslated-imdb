Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel, Starship Troopers, has been played in recent years, ranging from Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film and TV series to numerous games. But none of these, so to speak, really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually independent of each other, the TV series was rather a spin-off and the less we said about the Verhoeven film, the better. Most do not know, however, that in Japan an animated adaptation had already been made, published the year of Heinlein's death. And believe it or not, despite its differences, this animated 6-part series is the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic. <br /> <br /> The most obvious asset of this series is the presence of motorized armor exoskeletons, which we have been deprived of in the Verhoeven film. Like the book, the series focuses more on characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see enough of them. Although the events unfold differently from those described in the book, the atmosphere of the plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched than in the book. Some may think that dialogues and character interactions are a bit inferior to the book (the cartoon treatment is a little anime, but what did you expect?), But it is far superior to the movie. Heinlein's political views are simply excised, unlike the film, where they are reversed. The big advantage of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between soldiers and insects / aliens, which depicts the type of action of the propelled armor that we would have liked to see in a film version. <Br/> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to Heinlein's. And I think they did very well with that. If you can find this series, watch it.
