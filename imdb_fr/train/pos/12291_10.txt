A real classic. Beautifully filmed and played. Reveals a lively Parisian region filled with comedy and tragedy. Although the neighborhood of the North Hotel and the hotel itself still exists, it is not as cheerful (in the original sense of the word) and as happy as it must have been. The film makes a desire for the past, which has been lost, with a sigh and a sour sweetness.
