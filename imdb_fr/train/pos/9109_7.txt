It is mainly the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but the filmmakers usually start from a historical fact to talk about something else, or also show the period before or after this fact, here everything happens during the few days when the revolution is. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing as usual what they were, not like ordinary heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although it was made from the military's title army, you can understand that they were only "capita" as main characters. Beautiful colors and lights throughout the film, excellent work for the director being his first film, it does not fall into banality. Well shown the emotions and passion of people and the crowd. The character of Maia (the main character) is well done and Stefano Accorsi has a good interpretation, able to show the limits of Maia, it is not a hero.
