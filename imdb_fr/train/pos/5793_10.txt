Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a real adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the film's true story begins, we have a performance of the film Bad Tour (The Man in the Mirror) and the kick-off is given. a good film. After that, we get a kind of collage from Michael Carrier, as it was before the release of Moonwalker in 1988. After some video clips (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.), the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially that Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are being chased by the villain of the story "Mr. Big", because they have discovered his evil plan of to drug children around the world. During the pursuit, we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, etc. But then, one of the children is kidnapped by Mr. Big and Michael will try to save her before she becomes addicted. <br /> <br /> During the film, we see amazing special effects not only for these standards, but also for today. For example, see Michael turning to a robot / spaceship to protect his friends! It's so cool! <br /> <br /> The film ends with a performance of Come Together (later published in HIStory's double album Michaels), and you leave the film with a magical feeling. Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to all families who wish to spend a good night with candy and popcorn in front of the television. And now, some parents might get up and say, "But Michael Jackson is an alleged child molester!" Yes, it's true, but hey, we all know it's not true! Wait and watch ..
