"The Groove Tube" is one of only two films by Ken Shapiro, the other being the equally wacky "Modern Problems". This one is just a large-scale parody of television. In addition to Shapiro - who apparently did nothing after "Modern Problems" - the film also stars Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. The three members of the cast (plus a few other people in smaller roles) appear in different sketches. One of the funniest is Chase in an advertisement for Geritol, in which he describes the drug while his wife undresses, and the whole thing ends up banging him. There is also a program of pornographic information, an irritating cooking show and the epic story of some drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all this is a real hobby. In my opinion, the three best televised spoofing movies are this one, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I could also include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what ever happened to Ken Shapiro.
