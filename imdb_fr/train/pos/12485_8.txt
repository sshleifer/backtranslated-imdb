I just watched this movie and I must say that I was very impressed. It's very scary and has many moments that will make you jump off the spot! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that maybe if anything, there were too many jump moments. It came to the point where each new scene culminated with a jump, which gradually eased the effect of astonishment, as there was some kind of novelty. <br /> <br /> Although it contains virtually all phantom clich√©s, they have all been so well done that it has kept the fear factor scary. There were elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned fright!
