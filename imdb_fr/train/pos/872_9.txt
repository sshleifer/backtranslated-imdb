Carla works for a real estate developer where she excels at being unattractive, unappreciated and hopeless. She is also deaf. <br /> <br /> His boss proposes to hire someone to lighten his heavy workload. She takes this opportunity to ensure a male society. The help comes in the form of Paul, a tattooed thug who has just been released from prison and who is clearly unsuited to the usual routine of an office environment. <br /> <br /> Implicit sexual tension is created between them and Carla is determined to continue despite her reluctance to adopt the work week. When Carla got out of an important contract she was negotiating with a viscous colleague, she exploited Paul's crime by robbing him of the contract. The coworker soon realizes she's behind the theft, but when he confronts her, Paul's eagerness to hit people in the face is also helpful - but this murder comes at a price. <br /> <br /> Knowledge of the Mafia gave Paul a "hype" as a reminder of an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan that uses Carla's unique abilities for lip reading to scam a gang of violent bank robbers. Now it's Carla's turn to enter a new scary world. <br /> <br /> Director Jacques Audiard's fourth feature film, "READ MY LIPS", begins as a very engaging romantic drama between two marginalized losers, before moving on to an edgy thriller where their symbiotic gaps transform them. in winners. The tracks are excellent. to persuade us effortlessly that this strange couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is a nice farce in which she tries to go around her reluctance and unhealthy ways, before discovering that he was, until recently, a prisoner. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has this almost exclusive ability to go from dodgy to magnificent and to return to a setting. Vincent Cassel plays Paul like a stuck dog who only really seems at home when he beats or invents the scam that could kill him. <br /> <br /> Like many French movies, 'READ MY LIPS' seems, at first, to be on nothing in particular until you scratch under the surface and notice that it's probably about everything . The only mundane note is a secondary plot about the missing woman of Paul's parole officer; a device that seems to have been designed solely to help steer the storyline in a nice little cul-de-sac. <br /> <br /> This is the French "new wave" of the sixties that introduced the concept of genre to film making and I always thought that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a tag system to help you define it it is always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend the genre, or even better challenge it.
