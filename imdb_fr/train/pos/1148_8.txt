It's one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer, and Local Hero - that captures the viewer's interest time and time again. Lightweight films rarely win Oscars, but the one who made the cast of Soapdish deserves one. Even after seeing the film and knowing what's coming, it's always nice to watch how the various facets of the plot evolve. Of course, the whole drama is melodrama; but it's quite appropriate for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now, why can not I write like that?" I think it is unfortunate that television censors and websites insist on all these unnecessary remediation measures.
