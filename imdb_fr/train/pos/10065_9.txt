It is a superb film, suitable for all but the youngest, although the accessibility for the youngest has been tainted (at least in the printed version that I saw) by the use of an unfortunate choice of subtitles in English! For much of the film, it's almost impossible to guess how long it is - there's no modern technology, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bike, just a dull, almost monochrome everyday life, against which opposite is the dazzling exhibition of Sezuan Opera and celebration fireworks. Even if a group of soldiers refers to their imminent departure for a theater of war, this could still happen in the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we see a car briefly - late 30s, early. 40 years - and we realize that we are watching a China on the verge of great upheaval and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away by the cataclysm of the Second World War and the communist revolution. <br /> <br /> This makes the central character's desire to conform to ancient customs and traditions even more moving. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises vitally important issues, even today, both in China and in other countries. parts of the world: inequality between boys and girls, men and women; the trade, for various purposes, of young children; corruption in society; injustice; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm reading too much in this movie; but I do not think so! I also think it is outrageous that films of this caliber are often not broadcast in the UK, whereas slag is a quality material. <br /> <br /> But do not throw me on it. .
