I did not talk about "Still Crazy" with real anticipation. Just another rock'n'roll photo, I thought ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This film is partly that, but so much more. Brian Gibson, the director, has previously directed a biography of Tina Turner, and his style is very successful. I guess it's fitting that this is his last film. <br /> <br /> The cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as leader of the group. Actor turned director, Bruce Robinson appears as guitarist of the band. It does a superb job, even if it has not appeared in a movie since the late 70's. If you're looking for a touching and funny movie (with some great songs), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
