Shirley MacLaine plays another custom role. As an aunt of a single mother in a Chicago working-class neighborhood in 1962, this experienced character actress is once again training as a brave woman who will not let any defeat defeat her spirit of success. The children, a pre-adolescent boy and girl, are attracted to their Aunt Zoe, although his many magic tricks and practical jokes have been learned from him, and they have applied all the bad opportunities they have finally been fired from school. <br /> The plot is cleverly wrapped in the Cuban missile crisis, with all the social implications. Men building bomb shelters, people looking at information about what appeared to be the only television set in a restaurant, and a general fog of unease and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle is reversed, the decisive conclusion nevertheless gives the feeling that the viewer feels good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will rise tomorrow! Clearly a low-budget production, it's still a pretty little film, filled with the magic that Sunday mornings have been made. With some "Oldies" to choose from in an effective soundtrack, the whole family is sure to appreciate this one. ****
