This is undoubtedly the best performance of John Thaw, where he successfully removes all the traits of his character Inspector Morse and brings a perfect adaptation of Tom pages of the book on the television screen. It is a well-made production that maintains its family atmosphere despite well-developed themes such as the outbreak of the Second World War and the physical abuse suffered by the child. <br /> <br /> However, it's the relationship between Tom and young Willie, it's the heart and soul of this story. It is touching and beautiful to see this connection between the young boy evacuated from London and the grumpy old man he has yet to develop - a true grandfather / grandson connection. <br /> <br /> Too bad this story was Do not do it with a bigger budget with a more established director because it belongs to the big screen and does not show once or twice every ten years on Sunday after- midday. With the proper guidance, John Thaw would be celebrated around the world and would have received numerous awards for his brilliant performance in this film. A great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time.
