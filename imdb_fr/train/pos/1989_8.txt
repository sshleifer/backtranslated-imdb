I admit I do not like Oliver! as a young child - it's long, and the story is a bit slow because of all the musical numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the pleasure of this film is the experience itself. Rather than think of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, imagine it as a celebration of classical history. The adaptation is at best loose, but really, if you watch a musical, you are not there for the story. <br /> <br /> Music is at the heart of this film, and an overwhelming majority of it. is stellar and very catchy. Most or all of the actors were involved in the scenic version of the musical, and this is reflected in their interpretations - and I see this as an advantage. The performances are all in a more "scenic" style typical of much older films and they are very entertaining. The exception is the kid playing Oliver, whose job seemed to look cute and stay out of the way of real performers. <br /> <br /> Fagin and the Dodger are the real stars of this film. Oliver Reed is also doing a fantastic job of keeping an intimidating presence on the screen as a menacing Bill Sykes. Even Sykes's dog, Bullseye, performs well. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise it, just like those who take musicals too seriously. Denying broken historical details or taking the exaggerated type of scene for a bad game will spoil the pleasure of anyone. Relax and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that as a musical, it's a fantasy loosely organized around the book, not a strict adaptation.
