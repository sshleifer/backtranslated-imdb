Hello again, I have to comment on this wonderful, exciting and believable tale of romance and intrigue. The music is wonderful and memorable. Very good colorful film. Another film I liked too, later, is High Society with Bing Crosby. Wonderful music. Thank you for listening, Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
