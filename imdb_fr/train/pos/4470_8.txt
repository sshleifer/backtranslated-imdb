Similar to "On the Town", this musical about sailors on shore is not up to the classic in terms of rhythm and quality of songs, but it has its own charms. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry, the cartoon mouse "Tom and Jerry", one with a little girl and a fantastic sequence where he is a Spanish lover determined to join his lady on a high balcony. Sinatra, who plays Kelly's shy and inexperienced boyfriend, and Grayson, the woman who serves the two men in love, sing most of the time. Iturbi provides a good piano game. At almost half past two, it's a little too long for a light musical but it does not drag.
