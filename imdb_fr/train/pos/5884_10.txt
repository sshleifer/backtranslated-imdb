Really, I liked it. The premise was good, the story fit perfectly to the two respective series and here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They do not look like others who become synonymous with a given series and then refuse to talk about it or to organize possible meetings (Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family," is a good example). In fact, Valerie said she would love to make another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I'll be looking for another one ... but if it does not work, then maybe re-launch the one -this.
