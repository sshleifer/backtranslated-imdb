Jeopardy has the impression of being a kind of stock film - one of the movies that the studios have dumped between the big budget movies / the box office. It's just 70 minutes and few series, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star, of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is once again a hard lady, as she meets a convicted fugitive as she seeks help for her husband trapped in the Mexican desert. The majority of the film is centered on the way she treats her captor, who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help. Some psychological fight there. <br /> <br /> This is a surprisingly effective little movie: its short duration makes it tense and the fact that Stanwyck is awesome must be mentioned without any mention (but I will always congratulate her every time).
