Tom wanted to make a movie for a long time and he did it. it's as if he had visualized a dirty and worn notebook, full of small brilliant ideas that he filled and carried for 10 years. no character transformation, no Hollywood ingredients, just life and some magic. the balance, in speed, in strangeness in the comedy against the drama is perfectly weighed. This film takes you on a journey that ends before you realize how nice it was. the music is excellent and your eyes will be satisfied too. the fact that this film talks about nothing, simply a sequence of sketches of people mainly linked by a part of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining, it is brilliant because it is empty. between the lines, it happens. to see or not to see, is it?
