Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It's so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor of his country can be held in such low esteem in the United States. His worst "sin", in my opinion, is to take care of those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about it? I have always been fascinated by the reaction of the American government and the media to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good man (around 1959) when he supplanted Batista. Soon, however, Castro began directing Cuban societies towards the needs of the poor rather than big cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and our government have such a problem of sharing with the poor? If these types are "dictators", we could use more "dictatorships", especially where the poorest of the poor live.
