If you are a fan of film noir and think that it does not manufacture them as before, here is your answer: they do not manufacture them anymore in Hollywood. We must turn to the French to remind ourselves how good a film of this kind can be, subtle and fantastic. Read My Lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift offered by director Jacques Audiard to the faithful directors. Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel, great narrations and beautiful performances. <br /> <br /> The basic plot could have been written in the 40s: mute but seductive ex-prisoner and an intelligent but ill-fated femme fatale (which turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) discover themselves by living lives terrifying desperation and nostalgia, manipulate themselves to achieve their own goals, develop a complex love / hate relationship, cook criminal plan involving heist, double crosses, close-ups and lots of money. All actions take place in depressing, poor and / or poorly lit places. <br /> <br /> Audiard has of course fashioned some modern twists. The femme fatale is an underappreciated clerical worker who is almost deaf and uses her lip-reading skills to take revenge on those who marginalize her. And where you might expect hot love scenes, you discover that both characters are sexually clumsy and immature. Add to that a bit of modern technology and music. It looks like a contemporary film, but make no mistake: it's an old-fashioned film noir. It's as good as any movie of its kind and easily one of the best movies I've seen all year.
