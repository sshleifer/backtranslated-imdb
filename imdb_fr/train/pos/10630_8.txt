I think it is unfortunate that the main comments on this film include the words "Null and ruthless." I think it's a very funny movie and great entertainment. We must suspend the disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian could fall in love, have a child and live happily together forever. But it's always wonderful to watch him play in a movie and warm up his heart. Is it so impossible? There are far more unlikely events described in other films. The acting is good, the scenario is funny. The only negative comment is that the story could have ended when the family moved away from their original home instead of continuing to find out if the man was still homosexual.
