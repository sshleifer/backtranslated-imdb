This is an excellent movie for all fans of Hong Kong action movies. In addition to his plot, his low drama and his comical mischief, the film is full of action and combat between guns and martial arts. Have entertained me from beginning to end. I thought Shannon Lee was great in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having a director of action like Corey Yuen is what makes the Hong Kong stock continue to be strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
