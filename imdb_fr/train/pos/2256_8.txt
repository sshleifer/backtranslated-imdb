I did not know what to expect from Van Damme's partner and friend / coach and his combat choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him play the role of "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and other Van Damme films, now he's alone, he and his wife are a great team, and in this category, Qissi is the director. his wife was the writer, the producer, and did most of the scenes that did not require action, but she also edited the film together and they did an excellent job. meaning, the fight scenes were: well edited, the roles were real fighters and went well together - the story went well, and if you can believe it ... no vulgar language, no sex, just action, a new one on me.
