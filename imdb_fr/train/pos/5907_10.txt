It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents are from rural India and to a certain extent, I have seen the lives of the villagers. The people are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects exactly the same thing. Credits to director and actor. They did a great job. I'm just wondering how films like Lagaan and Paheli can go to Oscar and not to Doghi. I do not understand the criteria on which movies are selected. Does the money making the difference or having big names in the film make the difference. <br /> <br /> We hope to see more movies like this in the future.
