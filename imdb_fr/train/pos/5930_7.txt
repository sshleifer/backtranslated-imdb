Monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks the life force of the virgins and their new target is the pretty but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I've never been a fan of sordid and overrated best-sellers like King, Koontz or Barker, but this movie B, written by Mr. Dung himself, does not is actually not as bad as it could be. be. Yes, it is sometimes atrocious, but there are actually surprisingly impressive touches: good old-fashioned cemetery, strange soundtrack and candlelit gothic house scene, mirror showing the monstrous form of the wicked, etc. Of course, the film is polluted by Mr. Dung's dialogue and his obsession with maneuvering as much as possible to vilify fat people, leading to an unfounded plot as a rapist teacher, but there are roses in the manure.
