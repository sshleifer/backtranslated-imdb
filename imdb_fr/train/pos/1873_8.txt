The violent and rebel sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), aged 25, is sent for three assessment sessions with the Navy Psychiatrist, Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), after another assault and assault against a sailor ranked at the top rank. Reluctant at the beginning of the treatment, he gains confidence in Mr. Davenport and reveals his childhood, revealing the painful traumas generated in his host family. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant) and they fall in love with each other. Resolving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This real family drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a normal life. The management of Denzel Washington is excellent. It makes a story about child abuse sensitive, attractive and tasteful. In the hands of another director, the story could be very heavy. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando a Viver" ("Return to life")
