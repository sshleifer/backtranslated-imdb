I never attended a film screening at midnight before the release of "Dick Tracy". <br /> <br /> I still have the "t-shirt ticket" that I had to wear to be admitted somewhere here and, like this shirt, "Dick Tracy" stayed with me ever since. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the film, sharp images, bright primary colors and strong characters have definitely been etched in your brain. It's a marvel to see. <br /> <br /> As a director / star / co-writer / producer, Beatty knows what works in a movie and shows it here, taking a well-known American icon and recreating it for a whole. new era. Still in the '30s, "Tracy" has timeless quality as do all good movies. I forgot how many times I have watched "Tracy" and I always catch something new every time. <br /> <br /> The others are excellent, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney is a relevance in the sense where, in the right environment, it can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still themes such as the need for family, staying true to oneself, good versus evil, even Machiavellian themes are explored. Bizarre for a cartoon movie, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Dick Tracy" is a classic in itself. Compared to other films of this decade, he makes a strong statement. It's a good solid film that does not depend on blood, violence, profanity or nudity to make itself understood. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to be learned here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Super Scott!
