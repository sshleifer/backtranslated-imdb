I think a lot of people have a lower score than the movie, NOT because of the lack of quality. But he did not follow the standard Hollywood formula. Some of the conflicts are not resolved. The end is just a bit too real for others, but the journey provided by the rich characters and the long list of supporters is both stimulating and very entertaining. Even if cinematography is excellent considering the urban context, the realization is excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is a 10 in my book, this movie will take you to places like the normal and expected Hollywood scenario will not be. They took risks and did different things. I think it worked well, I deliberately try to avoid any direct reference to the film, because seeing it for yourself is the best answer, not accepting someone else's interpretation.
