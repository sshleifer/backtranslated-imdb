While I loved this film, the trailers that circulated on the Internet the year before its release in theaters set my expectations a bit too high. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD, so do not get me wrong, I do not say do not look at it or even not buy it! It's just that I always think the first scene was the best and nothing in the whole movie has ever passed.
