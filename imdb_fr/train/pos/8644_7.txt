**** = A masterpiece to record in books and never to forget <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic in time; to see absolutely <br /> <br /> *** = A solid piece, useful, very entertaining <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 = A good film, but there are uneven elements or defects Notable <br /> <br /> ** = Can still be considered valid in some areas, but this work is seriously problematic or limited by unavoidable elements deemed inevitable (eg gender) <br /> < br /> * 1/2 = Mainly a bunch of nothing caused by moments of interest <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not of visible quality <br /> <br /> - Kalifornia = ** * <br /> <br /> - Unrated (for violent and violent material, considerable sexuality and language) <br /> <br /> I rented this film while waiting for a summer celebration Brad Pitt's face as a blockbuster, but I was pleasantly surprised and disappointed. It's really more of a drama, and very sinister about that ... I remember Duchovny's emotionally intense voices off. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays his perhaps most sexual movie ever with a surprising talent. Who began as a hopeless but harmless "white" husband became a violent and disturbing alcoholic with a disordered spirit. During some of the last stages of the film, I struggled to keep watching - it was unpredictable and scary. This is very good for writing and playing. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is filled with strange and sensational scenes that made me hold my breath no less than once, and I do not do not talk about action scenes. I mean scenes of dialogue so brilliantly designed that I actually grinned and gasped at what I saw. It was like watching a rhinoceros and a lion put in a cage and watching them biting. Once again, I am very impressed by the scriptwriter (s); no matter who they did the impossible: a mixture of oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also liked the performance of Juliette Lewis. It's so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does, it's such a bliss. Some of his moments in this movie made me cry. I want to say that. The emotions that this girl can arouse in your head are incredible and I very well remember having her eyes scrambled on a few occasions. <br /> <br /> I almost feel like I'm deceiving the quality know-how that the filmmakers have shown. give *** "KALIFORNIA" a *** ranking. But the dark feelings he generates are too powerful and depressing to bring him up. I think everyone should see this movie, though. I really do it.
