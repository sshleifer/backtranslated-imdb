I see many people on this site who wish that AG will be released on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, no less!) Although it's great to have this amazing DVD-boxed show, I'm annoyed by the fact that they've added very few "supplements" (A comment from Shaun's director Cassidy on Pilot Episode) and the episodes are broadcast in the same order as their broadcast on television. Missing episodes that have never been viewed before appearing on the Sci Fi channel are in the box, but are added to the final DVD. If you buy the DVD game, get the order in which you want to watch it and you will be happier. (You will have to swap the DVDs of your player to see them in order, but you will not regret it.) <br /> <br /> S
