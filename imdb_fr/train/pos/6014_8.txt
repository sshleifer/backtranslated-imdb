Seriously, these frank and sober criticisms of ZP miss the point. You can not get anything from this movie in a simple state of mind. <br /> <br /> As long as you did not watch this film on the big screen (which I'm lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was rather rare), you have not no idea what this movie is. <br /> <br /> If you insist that he is not intoxicated, you can at least enjoy the end when the shit explodes Pink Floyd's wonderful reworking of "Careful With That Ax," Eugene "," Enter number 51, your time is up.
