What little class of British cinema! It's time And a comedy cut in half! <br /> <br /> For those who seek to relive a little freedom after being neglected in their youth, this road movie will be the solution. <br /> <br /> It's a mix between "Withnail and me" and "Easy Rider". The film runs at a fast pace and does not let you drift too long ... Sometimes there are moments of reflection, but I think they are well justified and add to the characters that actors describe. I was a little preoccupied with the character of Phil Daniels at first, but fortunately he was conquered midway through one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie! In general, I found myself laughing through the film, which probably embarrassed some people around me. Oh good. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. It will become a cult British comedy. Well worth a visit.
