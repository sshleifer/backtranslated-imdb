Twisted, funny, enchanting and hilarious! I could not help but laugh while watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he made on the family camcorder that grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker, his motivations and his ability to manipulate for the camera . Manipulation is a strong word, but do not we watch all the movies to be manipulated in one way or another? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I had fun with the fact that the boys in the movies seemed to be out of shirt as much as possible. Later, Darren comments on his nascent homosexuality, and you can see it among the hints (allusions!) Of flamboyance at a young age. Maybe it was just the heat of Southern California, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a stimulating environment, it's nice to see that his parents support him and love him, and that his friends seem to be fascinated by his emerging talent behind the lens. <br /> "Put the Camera On Me" gives you a glimpse of the 80s, spared by commercialism.You will remember hair, music and fashions.I am the same age as Mr. Stein, then the return trip to Memory Lane was a welcome one, and his solo lip sync dance number is invaluable, reinforced by the Frankie Goes To Hollywood t-shirt. <br /> <br /> The films deal with dark themes in the Child abuse, holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasies and social dysfunction No child is completely carefree, and the way Stein approaches these topics is interesting and hilarious to watch. <br /> <br /> Watch as soon as you want!
