"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible and wonderfully perverted film, as only director Sirk could have done. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramatic and colorful contrasts. The link between financial success and moral decadence is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to see the film as an excellent example of what Sirk could do with kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The game in the movie is great too. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (who deserves the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role), who manage to keep the film boiling. Congratulations to Frank Skinner for his thrilling score, for Russell Metty's brilliant photographic work (each shot is a masterpiece in itself) and for the production design department. In addition, the title song is a beauty. It's an unforgettable film.
