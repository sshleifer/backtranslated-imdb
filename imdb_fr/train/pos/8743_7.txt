A good movie with good performances (especially the first two). The film is about two American girls being caught 6 kilos heroin at an airport in Thailand. They are both thrown into prison and one of them signs confessions. Bill Pullman plays the lawyer trying to get them out. All they have to do is find a Nick Parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. So far for the story that is not so original (it looks a lot like the best back in paradise). <br /> <br /> The play of actors and the superb photography of Newton Thomas Sigel make this film interesting to watch. A 7 out of 10.
