One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to watch LION KING again without thinking about the extra story this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight and I have not laughed so much and enjoyed a movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> Take the time to look at this with the kids. It will remind you how Disney was when you were young.
