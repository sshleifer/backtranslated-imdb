It's one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a beautiful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes James J. Corbett's story particularly interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the boxing style that continues today. In this respect, James J. Corbett was truly innovative. But back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it's a period piece, history stands the test of time; he did not disappear. Ward Bond's performance of John L. Sullivan must be one of the greatest representations of a sports figure in film history, and the boxing scenes are realistic, well directed and very effective. This film, associated with an excellent script, makes this film a must.
