Temporal paradoxes are the devil's trap for underemployed minds. They are fun to consider in a "what if?" sort of way. Filmmakers and writers have addressed this issue many times in many movies and TV series, including "Star Trek: First Contact", "Back to the Future" trilogy, "The Great Adventure of Bill and Ted", " Groundhog Day "and Tribute to Stargate SG1," Window of Opportunity ". Heinlein's "All You Zombies" was written decades ago and yet readers who read this news for the first time will not be surprised. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam's excellent film, "12 Monkeys", it's difficult to establish what continuity problems may be in relation to plot elements designed to make us rethink our film design. Repeated viewing will lead us to different conclusions if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, seeing the film for the first time, will consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most people will see Cole as a man troubled by what Adams describes as "the constant tearing of the experience" that is returned to him by a journey back in time. <br /> <br /> Unlike other stories of time travel, "12 Monkeys" do not know if future history can be changed by manipulating past events. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that the time can not be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he was fired in 1996, according to his own schedule. <BR /> <br /> Even this could be interpreted as an event that was to occur in a unique temporal world, to ensure that the timeline is not changed ... Cole must die in front of his youngest self for destiny to be realized. If this is the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces acting on it. It's amazing to think too much about these things. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events, these will guide the actions of those who have the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film therefore, it means that the future MAY be changed by manipulating past events ... or does it? The film probably gave rise to many drunken fights in bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians.
