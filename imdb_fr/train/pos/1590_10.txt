I just started watching the TV show "What I like about you" and I must say it's a pleasure to watch. I always like to see the new concerts go well, as many concerts take place before you really feel them. I've been watching Amanda Bynes since "All That", she's really a funny girl, which is good in her comedy, it's that it's so natural and what I mean by that is something that one person could say here, his best friend, is not repeated. <br /> <br /> I just watched the show and fell in love with myself. I'm just watching reruns from now but I'm looking forward to the next season. All the characters in the series give something to the whole story. It's nice to see an old face from other shows I've enjoyed watching in the past, like Jennie Garth of "90210", Leslie Grossman of "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan of "City Guys". The new characters also have a lot of talent, Nick Zano has that charm that makes you love him even when he does something wrong with holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Overall, this show has the right ingredients to succeed. I can not wait to see him grow up.
