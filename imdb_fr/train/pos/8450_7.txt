It was not really bad for Raw's first PPV in 006. But the end was really shocking for everyone present and those watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- RIC FLAIR VS. LEADING WITH LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP This is not a bad start to the game, these two can seriously organize a great match if they had more time to play a wrestling match. Flair wins by DQ after Edge hit him with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH- TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP It's not bad that this is the first time these Divas have played in the ring. Mickie opts for a modified chick kick, but Trish shoots his own chick kick to keep his title. 3/10 THIRD GAME - TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW Seriously good, this match was really. All match, HHH focuses on the injured arm of Big Show, but Big Show still defends itself. Later, HHH is able to switch Big Show and a pedigree for victory. FOURTH MATCH - SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {It was a bonus match} Not bad, it was good. After Viscera's descent, behind the referee, Benjamin's mom received a handbag (which had bricks) and hit Viscera on the head three times. Viscera only got up to get caught in Benjamin's heel with a heel twist for victory against the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH GAME - JERRY LAWLER LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS boring, slow and sloppy. The two men did not really make a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a fall for the victory. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH GAME - TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST FEMALE GAUNTLET GAME It was pretty fun for me. Ashley {I think} Eliminates Candice last to win Gauntlet's first women's game. 5/10 SEVENTH GAME - JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE WITH DAIVARI IN A WWE CHAMPIONSHIP ELIMINATING MATCH It was a cool match in the Elimination Chamber. But nothing will exceed last year's elimination chamber, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena and Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and gets a roll-up to eliminate him. A few seconds later, Cena gets a report on Carlito so that all three counts win the elimination chamber and retain his WWE title. But his night was not over. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon arrives and congratulates Cena for his victory. Vince McMahon said his evening was not over yet and Edge was taking advantage of Money In The Bank's opportunity to challenge Cena for the title. Edge arrives with Lita, hands the briefcase over to Vince and goes into the ring, with Cena still having a game here tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena who is busted during the game in the room} is immediately pounded by Edge, Edge then nails a spear at Cena, looks for cover and under the shock that Cena bursts. Edge beats another Spear and covers on behalf of three shocking as he defeated Cena and won the WWE title for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year's, but all was well. The EC match was also good and the shock of Edge's cashing in his MITB opportunity is certainly the most shocking of the PPV series. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll give it 7/10 and a C
