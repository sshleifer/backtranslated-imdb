Composed and elegant, Carol (beautifully played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her nice husband Eddie (friendly David Houseman), Carol's wacky, constantly eating his best friend Anna (deliciously tried by the adorable zeal of the adorable Chris Jordan) and Anna's hunky, the loving husband Pete (Eric Edwards) is a quartet of swinger libertines who like to have frequent sex in a group. Their usual routine is disrupted when Jennifer's widowed, lonely and repressed, but still seductive mother (a touching performance of the charming Jennifer Welles) presents herself for a visit. Soon, Jennifer relaxes and becomes a volunteer participant in the carnal lifestyle of both happy, pleasant and uninhibited swingers. Everyone except Carol is eager to seduce her. Screenwriter / Director Joe Sarno invents an in-depth, captivating and captivating examination of the suburban anguish and limits of the wild sex revolution of the 1970s; Sarno overthrows the traditional mores of the middle class and spices things up with a daring intrigue intrigue and provocative mother / daughter. In addition, Sarno elicits first-rate reactions from leading actors: Welles and Brooke are exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as Shandara New Age sex therapist, and Erica Eaton in as a mischievous neighbor, Mrs. . The fields. Better still, all women are extremely hot and attractive; Welles in particular seriously blurs the screen with its extraordinarily voluptuous silhouette and steaming erotic presence. The sex scenes are really hot and quite explicit, but never scathing or tedious. Stephen Colwell's brilliant and brilliant cinematography and Jack Justis' dynamic and melodic acoustic acoustic folk music are both solid and effective. Recommended viewing for Sarno fans.
