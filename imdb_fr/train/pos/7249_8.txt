It is difficult for me to attribute the "right" number of stars to this film, but I opted for the 8 because of its high production values ​​and innovative approach to the 1968 war movie. you too, that I have not seen it since 1969. But that made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> The Long Day's Dying must be one of the most vibrant anti-war films ever made. He achieves this simply by describing in an extremely realistic manner the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern Europe in 1944-1945. No film before this one showed war at the level of the infantry brigade with so many brutal details and all with a coldness and passion that allow the actions to speak for themselves. There is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenario. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no subtlety either. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters appear as familiar and flat cliches. As "entertainment", the film does not do it, even though it was clearly not meant to "entertain". The goal was to make you lose your head with the misery and horror of the Second World War and modern war in general. It was twenty years before the peloton and thirty before the rescue of Private Ryan, two films much more "watchable". Here, the flat and generally unpleasant characters, the absence of real plot and the realistic and unpleasant images (including what might be the first thug on the screen of theatrical history) make the film difficult, even if it lasts only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll get when it's over, a bonus star to have the heart in the right place. Medium: 8. Like Carl Foreman's under-rated film "The Victors", an equally casual but more interesting and stimulating film, The Long Day's Dying does not seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been on the cable several times.
