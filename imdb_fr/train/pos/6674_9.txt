The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this film so adorable and funny that its bomb status defies logic. Well, I hope that in the future, it will become a hit cult and you can count on me among his fans. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, and without saying too much, this movie is for the comic book what "Princess Bride" did for fairy tales and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" made for classic cartoons. This should give you a better idea of ​​the tone of the film than the marketing committee to which it was unfortunately signed (this is a case like "The Iron Giant" where the studio had no idea what it was had on the hands). Rent it the next time you want something a little off the wall. You will never listen to the BeeGees again under the same lighting.
