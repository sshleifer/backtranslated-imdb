I totally disagree. I thought it was a great movie for kids. The dawn of Gilligans Island, and the promise of a dana plato.it hardly known at the time, was disgusting. I do not want to ruin the end. But it was unusual in the way it was done. I mean, the kids characters were great and I did not know what to expect in the end. the plot has also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say that the fact that these kids are experienced fishermen is at the center of the plot, especially in the beginning. It also helps them get out of a traffic jam to the end.It also has the advantage of not being too long.I think it takes less than 95 minutes
