After a few difficulties, Johnny Yuma goes to his sick uncle's ranch to resume his day-to-day activities, only to discover that the old man was murdered by his beautiful gold-looking wife and his vicious brother. <br /> <br /> Good production values, a friendly performance by Mark Damon and an action-packed script combine to make it an entertaining, even unusually deep, above-average addition to the spaghetti western genre. <br /> <br /> The star Rosalba Neri is one of the most fashionable European girls to date. Here she is absolutely perfect as a user (and abuser) to the cold heart of weak men. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri have appeared together in at least one other picture, The Devil's Wedding Night, a very good horror movie special interest for those who want to see what is hiding under Rosalba's dresses.
