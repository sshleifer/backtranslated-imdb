In 2054 Paris, Avalon, a computer-generated system, controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped, detective Karas (Craig) has to go to Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> Renaissance is a beautiful blend of films This mix is ​​associated with a futuristic conceptual narrative that illuminates the screen in a shocking mansion, with a black-themed ideology and conceptual mounts that should delight more than a. <br /> <br /> Pixar are the masters of animation. Their many Oscar-winning films are countless, from the charming Toy Story to the mysterious Wall-E. Any company or director has a real challenge. However, Renaissance is not a film for young audiences and, like Persepolis in 2007, brings a strong and mature animation-like approach to turn an older and more stimulating film into a more focused generation. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released Sin City, an incredibly brilliant black film, which revolutionized the use of the green screen with a beautiful balance between black and white shooting and a few splashes of color . A year later, Christian Volckman took a similar approach with this visually stunning masterpiece in the making of a film. <br /> <br /> The image of Volckman is full of animation, but it does not seem half realistic, because the majority of his time is 1 hour and 40 minutes. The faces of the character are well represented and in particular, this film must be the most beautiful of all time for the use of the shadow. The fact that we never know if the night or the day is of little importance when it comes to looking at the stony faces while the shadows are confused between their expressions. It's almost an intelligent use of pathetic error, and it's also perfectly directed. <br /> <br /> For all those who have seen Persepolis, you have come to the conclusion that this is one of the best directed animations ever planned for the simple, very conceptual artistic style of Marjane Satrapi < Renaissance also adapts to this image and rivals it in many cases with more powerful graphics and a darker tone reflecting the atmosphere. One scene especially when Karas appears in the dark is beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The narrative revolves around an obstinate and curious political government that monitors every citizen. The Paris race is based on the mysterious Avalon, whom we do not see enough to understand the essence of his true domination. Renaissance checks the narrative surrounding the attempts of a police officer tired of rescuing the mysterious woman, then we see the tired and boring police officer Craig trying to help as he struggles with other elements. There are a lot of things wrong with the script, not to mention the tired and exasperated routine of the cops, but there's a lot of frenetic adrenaline and slender jokes between the characters to keep him alive until the last step.
