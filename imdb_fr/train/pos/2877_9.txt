I do not think I need to tell you the story. Because it has been said for years and years. So I'm just going to share my feelings. I saw Cinderella when I was five years old. From that moment on, I was a Disney kid in a good way. The animation now looks childish and old-fashioned, but that's part of its charm now. Now, in the high school era, computer-generated and computer-generated images seem to have forgotten people's genius and the magic essence of early Disney movies. Fortunately, I was born before that, so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems that no matter how old I am, I'm back to this five-year-old boy watching him on VHS. What is the real magic of Disney.
