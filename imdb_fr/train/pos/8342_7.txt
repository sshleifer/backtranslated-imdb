Pretty good romantic comedy in which I do not think I have ever seen Meg more cute. All the players did a good job keeping this lively whirlpool. Of course, in the real world, no genius mathematician would even take a look at an adeptic monkey, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... we can simply forget the reality and have a good time. time. Beautiful movie. Damn, Meg is a baby, huh?
