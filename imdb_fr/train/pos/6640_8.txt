This one minute film is probably the first film ever made. Other inventors had already filmed actions - like the cinematographic photograph of a sneeze from Edison - but the Lumiere brothers have come up with a piece of equipment that is making a huge difference in support. At the time, of course, their "cinematograph" must have baffled their peers, including their subjects. In this first case, the brothers register employees who leave their factory, some of whom naturally have trouble hiding their awareness of the camera. The Lights are trying to make the movie more entertaining by introducing animals and a bike, but "The output of light factories" is not up to the ingenuity of their subsequent films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the selection by the brothers of a familiar ritual of the working class. Their choice is the initial proof of their curiosity for all the peoples of the world, a quality that makes the visualization of their experiences extremely rewarding and fascinating today. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
