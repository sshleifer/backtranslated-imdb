Another comment about this movie made the sound ugly. The spoken images were so new - I think the script and the acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not found her own style yet. It's great to see her like this - to continue to learn the job. <br /> <br /> So many clich√©s come from this film and it seems that this film has traced traces for the next 70 years. My vote is to see it and remember the youth of this type of film. Keep an open mind and you may be shocked to see how disturbed the characters were in this picture, because we were in 1934 and we see the beginning of the last century as blocked. I love that and I hope you decide you do not want to be influenced by other negatives and a commentary.
