It looks like a movie that looks like J. Edgar Hoover at first glance, who congratulates himself on having fought Klansmen, attacked Indian killers, sued the famous gangsters of the 1930s, and fought Nazis in the United States. and in the South. America during the Second World War and Commies in New York in the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959, we did not know that Mr. Hoover was obsessed with the desire to keep secret records on honest Americans, disturbing people like Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., but worst of all, his secret love affair with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to know more about this subject, I suggest seeing the movie Citizen Cohn). Hoover aside, this story of a life in the FBI told by Jimmy Stewart is a decent but dated movie. Vera Miles as a devoted woman is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. Although Hoover controlled the production and still ensured that the FBI was seen without fail, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, a real feat considering Hoover was still looking over his shoulder. The bottom note is also nice. I read recent articles online suggesting that this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time and none of her films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show it a long time ago and I hope they will show it again.
