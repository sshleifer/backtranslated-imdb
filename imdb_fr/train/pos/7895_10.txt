In the first scenes of this film, a man shot arrows in another man's hotel room and turned off all the lights. It must have been very funny for 1936, but rather far and unrelated to the film, Robin Hood did not make an appearance as far as I can see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "August Whales," 87 was very young and attractive and was playing one of her best roles during a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or being sexy with her nightgowns and swimsuit on her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase", 46. Daisey even proposed the wedding of Johnny in a big wheel upside down and even had a black eye. Davis and Brent have formed a beautiful couple, one supposed to be very rich and the other very poor. Outside of the scene, Davis and Brent had a real love story, which is a good reason why there were sparks when these two appeared in this movie. If you liked Bette Davis and George Brent, this movie is for you!
