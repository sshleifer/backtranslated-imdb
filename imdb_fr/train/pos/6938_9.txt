"Winchester '73" has something in common with "Casablanca". As you watch this show, you get the impression that you are watching a series of shots so often seen in the genre. you then realize that the clichés only became clichés after being copied from this particular film, and that they were copied so widely because this film was awesome. In other words, it's a fundamental work. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a joy to watch. The outline of the plot is quite predictable, but mostly because you have seen them copied over and over again in more recent movies. Nevertheless, it still contains a number of twists that will surprise you. The dialogue, rhythm and direction of Mann are excellent. Stewart shines especially and if you're a fan, it's a "must", but he's not the only one to offer a good performance. Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and / or spiritual lines go to minor characters. Because these characters are (much) more than cardboard cutouts, it added realism to the film. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkably underrated film that deserves a visit. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart that provides general information about the film.
