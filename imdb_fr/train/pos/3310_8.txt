Kongwon-do presents in the film a relatively intimate look at the meaning (as well as the meaningless meaningless meaning) of the lives of various Koreans; empty people looking for ways to fill themselves, enjoying the escape of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film, we observe the fallibility of the different characters; we learn from their weaknesses and their desires, from the global complexity captured in human life (and yet from the global simplicity of humanity). Although the film is moving slowly, it can be very contemplative. This does not force the ideas, but allows the ideas to develop themselves, it allows the concepts to reveal themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie ends as fast and as fast as it starts and you really understand the meaning. of loneliness, this love is often an act of egoism and the many mistakes we make. It is a glimpse of everyday life, very well and beautifully done. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action or an intense drama, this film does not suit you. However, if you like honest, original and meaningful movies that are not forced and without pomp, this is a great movie to watch.
