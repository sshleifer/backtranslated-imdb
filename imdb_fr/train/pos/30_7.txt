An old family story told to two girls by their grandfather is told 16 years later, as he had predicted. <br /> <br /> People are murdered, blood is shed and rats run everywhere and naked bodies are appreciated. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Did Evelyn come back from death to take revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is superb in this thriller Emilio Miraglia, which has made only one Giallo, to my knowledge. <br /> <br /> The only thing that ruined the film is the appearance that several frames have been cut. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there to save Kitty.
