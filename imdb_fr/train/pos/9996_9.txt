I have not read the other reviews on the film, but judging by the average rating, I find that they will probably not be very complementary. <br /> <br /> I watched it for the second time with my children. They really loved it. It is true that adults did not have to roll on the floor, but the sound of the children's joy made it sound. <br /> <br /> It's a real joke of Mel Brooks, with a lot of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money, not for who we are, and how inconstant are our friends and associates. There are undoubtedly many other films on a similar topic, many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults. It's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the younger members of the family. <br /> <br /> That's why, for children, a 9/10 from me.
