You'd better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start looking at it later, you'll be confused about what's going on in Clark's life. <br /> <br /> And yet, it's the fault; Clark is stuck in an alternative reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair because of the bridge accident when he missed Clark in the series driver. Martha is married to Lionel. The most constant is her most faithful friend, Chloe, who still believes in who he is. And, oh yes, he does not have super powers. He is in a mental institution for having placed himself in an imaginary world where he has powers and of which he is ridiculed to believe. Apart from Chloe, a mysterious character believes in Clark: a black man who, in parallel reality, is also resident of the institution and thinks he is from Mars. <br /> <br /> Clark must stay true to everything he believes is the real reality, and not to brainwash the institution's psychiatrist, who is in fact the fourth escape from the ghost zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is absolutely breathtaking and shocking. In addition, it brings a new touch to the usual episode type of "Smallville".
