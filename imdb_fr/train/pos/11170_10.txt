There is something about Pet Sematary that I have never felt elsewhere. Perhaps the fact that I was a child when I first watched it made this experience so memorable. But as I watch it again and again, it never gets old and I never get bored. From the opening credits with this scary opening song to the very chaotic end, there is something crazy, sad and scary at the same time, and it continues to resonate in your mind: sometimes, death is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to tell the whole story again. All you need to know is that it starts at point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and gradually drowns in point B (which, believe me, is the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and Pet Petary is the last place on earth that I would be. As I said, sometimes death is better!
