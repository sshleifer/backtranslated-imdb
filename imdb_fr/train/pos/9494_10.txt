WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD versions and on VHS. He claimed that he was one of the funniest and coolest actors ever created. In general, I do not watch movies knowing that they will be bad, but I made an exception for this one ... and I was very happy to have done it. <br /> <br /> It's filled to the brim with action (mostly amazingly, graphically gore), sleaze (isolated to nudity with a female key character, but there's so much in one scene it becomes hilarious) and an outrageously awkward dialogue, which adds to the film's Tonic laughter. <br /> <br /> Ginty, the unusual looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget action films) is fun in mind, offering the best possible performance. Williamson is better than usual, hitting him with unparalleled joy (and he only gets to midway). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially the bad guys, one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that seems to be a hodgepodge of Spanish and Italian. It is priceless. <br /> <br /> Once again, I can not emphasize enough its horror. It's not so bloody that it's nauseating, but it's unusually violent in places with some fleshy buds that go off in the shootings and there's a grueling torture sequence that no one will soon forget. In addition, when Ginty is invaded by a bunch of bad guys, he easily grabs a chainsaw and the splatters that ensue will cause all action fans to cheer and spill their beer. <br /> <br /> Do not miss WHITE FIRE. It's a classic action - so stupid that stupid -.
