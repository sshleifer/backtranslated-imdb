I watched this film in the early hours of the morning when I should have fallen asleep. This, in itself, was the testimony that Deliverance was a fascinating film. I think Boorman did a great job in making this film. How well did the early scene with the mountaineers and banjos duel be done brilliantly? It proved so early and how reserved and simple people in the area were. A typical example - towards the end of the "duel", the boy playing the banjo was smiling (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake his hand after the "duel", the boy was too reserved to answer. The river trip has never bothered you, of course. The scene of rape was brutal, but necessary to show what the group was facing in this remote region of Georgia. I think Beatty's traumatic shock was well done afterwards. Some said he was not affected by the ordeal. I do not agree - if you really paid attention, he did not react during all the action that immediately followed, during which Reynolds passed the arrow through the attacker and chased the guy toothless. It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. It almost seems like the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expecting to die, but you realized that the arrow he had shot earlier had finally made its effect. <br /> <br /> hesitating between 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading the message of a disgruntled voter who awarded him a "1", I awarded him a "10". The reasoning of this individual seemed based on personal prejudices, rather than on an objective point of view, and his vote was clearly an uncorrelated attempt to lower the bill.
