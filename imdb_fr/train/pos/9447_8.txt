Captivating drama of four men on a weekend boating on an isolated river. They are pacifists Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), odious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are fantastic - there's the amazing banjo duel sequence, interesting interaction between the characters and a great cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby ... and the trip becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. The landscape is incredibly beautiful and yet this horrible violence takes place. To be honest, Beatty's rape never bothered me - I'm very conscious of the fact that he's being falsified despite good acting. This film also shows how the characters change - Ed gets his pacifism tested, Lewis gets weak, Bobby is raped by one of the people he mocked earlier and Drew tries to stay sane. The direction given by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river contribute enormously to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The acting game is generally good. Voight is just OK in the lead - he has been better. Beatty is just OK - but this is his first film and he has the courage to play such a risky role. Cox is very good especially when things start to collapse. And Reynolds is just beautiful - one of his best comedian roles EVER! How it was not even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. In addition, Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are far too credible as hillbillies. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT for kids. Try to see an uncut version - the TV version is slaughtered. Mailbox viewing is also essential for capturing breathtaking images.
