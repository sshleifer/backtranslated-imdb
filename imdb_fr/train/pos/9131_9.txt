'I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain.' It's an excellent movie. It should have been re-evaluated at PG-13. Anyway, the first and the greatest film of Prince. Follow-up was nil. But I have not seen in years, so here's what I can remember. The boy (Prince) must reconcile the conquest of the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), the maintenance of his group (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension in his family. But his rival group (The Time as such) is ruining his life. As Morris (himself) tries to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Very well. Praise him, laugh and cry, and if you love him, buy him.
