Although Super Mario 64 does not look like the rest of the games in the series, it remains a classic and is just as good as the old games. Games with this replay value are rare. Plus, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels, each with several tasks that you can perform, as well as many other hidden tasks. The game is not very difficult, but its lack of challenge does not detract from the game. Once you beat him, you will want to clear your game and start again. And it's just as fun the second time, or the third time, or the two hundredth time. A must for any Nintendo 64 owner, and is a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64.
