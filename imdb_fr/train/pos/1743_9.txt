After seeing a lot of Greek films, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after watching this, I felt astonished. The cinema is great without much effort. You can not pretend that the screenplay is so big or the photography is perfect or something technical. It's a real story and it's happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten by God. The film is like a punch in the stomach and I really wish things were not like that. This obviously speaks of the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) to something different. The problem of this type is not that he is an ex-convict. The problem is that he is not one of those people. He is different and they do not want them (that's why all the good things he does turn into a boomerang). And also speaks of the apathy of the people, because there are people who are against the king's hunt, but they dare not say their opinion. In the end, you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society that is religious and tries to act as God says, but at the same time so unjustly for the king. This shows how easily people can rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. In the end, you can learn a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means that you can only understand and be part of this company if you want to be part of it. If you want to stay different and even alone, you are lost (and it is not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is real and that it should be a bell for everyone. No comment for the main actor because he has already received an award and I think his piece was great. Little comment for Hatzisavvas (plays the policeman), he's like a dinosaur, he played a lot of roles and I'm sure that role was very easy for him, but he plays it so well that you can not deny him a big Bravo. . I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
