This hilarious line is typical of what these ugly sisters say. (It's funny like that and quite funny too unintentionally.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, are they bad too! We give ourselves to pin poses and salacious comments where she goes. The other looks like Marilyn Monroe. She has these sensual lips, slightly separated. And, to reveal nothing, it is even worse than the other. <br /> <br /> The three sisters are played by starlets. The man who falls into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something of a career. <br /> <br /> This looks like today's first ever soft-core commercial porn ever. Of course, not the first, but the most racy of this era. <br /> <br /> The girls wear as little as possible and do not forget the female members of the audience: we show Bromfield shaving with an electric razor - which was it fetish? - shirtless. He was also shown to be wet in a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There is also a real conspiracy: the family of girls, you see, is cursed. They are subject to suicide - or dramatic deaths that may look like suicide. <br /> <br /> The film is not bad. I really do not know where this has been shown. Maybe it was done for drive-ins. In a way, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the main target here. Women are badly dressed. They often look like sneaky covers of magazines such as the police detective or jackets of dimes novels. <br /> <br /> But the guy seems to be at the center of things. Everyone in the movie does not like it, but all girls love it. And I think the public is supposed to do the same. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and on its own terms, too.
