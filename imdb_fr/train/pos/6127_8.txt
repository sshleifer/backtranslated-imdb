Jack Frost talks about a serial killer sentenced to death. En route to the death penalty, the prison truck in which he drives collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules into snow on the ground turning him into a snowman. . Being a killer himself who would turn him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him. Jack is now starting his war again, killing people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has a chance to become a horror classic, but it's an entertaining film. Put your brain on hold and have fun with it, but do not take it too seriously.
