After reading several comments, I felt the need to add my two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen. I had the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was wonderfully complex - especially for such a short time. The story centers on a girl victim of her violent father. She soon has the choice to "stop her" by a demon played by "Eric Etebari of Witchblade". After watching the show, I was incredibly impressed by the way he played such a unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The acting was absolutely superb by him. The girl was well and the father's was decent. There is also death in what follows the girl until she is able to escape her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely breathtaking. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budgets for that. It is rare for you to see a short film of such quality. The opening was absolutely breathtaking, comparable to that of any feature film. That's not to say it's not flawless - I thought it took a bit to start and the intro was a bit long. But that remained engraved in my head a few days after watching it. There are very few courts with this level of quality.
