A few years ago, I added a comment to the BDMI on the television series "The Real McCoys". I then told him and I repeat that it was a charming, entertaining and entertaining show with great performances. <br /> <br /> I recently saw on DVD four old episodes PLUS the 2000 Meeting with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another author mentioned here, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) have not been mentioned, but they may be able to be searched via SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The show meeting was well done and gave us many unknown ideas in the show. Privileged information that we did NOT have was whether Kathy Nolan regretted leaving the series after an unpleasant contract conflict, which left Luke a "widow" last year, which was not very good. Nolan then bombed a comedy titled "Broadside" about nurses in the Pacific during the Second World War. Find? Bordered? No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike TRASH on TV that is so sordid, salacious and violent, that so undermines our values, "The Real McCoys" is entertained by decent values ​​and good human beings. And I thank everyone involved, including the designer, Irving Pinkus, for bringing it to my family. We have never missed it.
