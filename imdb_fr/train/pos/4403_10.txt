Ride with the Devil, like Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical significance. Cinema buffs must see it at least twice, because its artistic nuance deserves to be too much understood. <br /> <br /> A perfect work of art, of surprising depth of humanity. I do not really remember another war movie, so I will capture you, change your current conception of history and politics, you will restore your trust in humanity. After seeing so many murders, so much suffering, you do not feel numb, you cherish more the connection between human beings. The performances of the actors haunt your heart, the music motivates you. Some shoots are not just images, they transcend themselves, becoming the vision of the soul. This is the true meaning of the film, which is a kind of art. <br /> <br /> A film like this does not require long comments or criticism, all it says itself. Ovation to the cast that includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the director of photography and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!
