It was not until I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just a beautiful feeling and yet never bend down to be soppy. There is an excellent cinematography and the main girl is pretty bright. It captures more than the nostalgia of time. It has a real heart. It is the Achilles injury of childhood that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I am looking for his next project. Follow-up is always the most difficult thing. It's like the blues of the second album for most people. <br /> <br /> I only hope that his next film will not be as lame as a shark film. Congratulations to everybody. Enjoy your cinema.
