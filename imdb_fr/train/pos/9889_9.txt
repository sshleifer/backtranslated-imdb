Read Eric's review again. He perfectly described what I felt for this film more eloquently than ever. I only write here to encourage you more to seek and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on television, IFC, I think. It's such a unique film that I hesitate to make comparisons. It was shot in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. It's not the Durango in Mexico (John Wayne movies) that looks like Sedona, but a really wild and wild place. I have to find the novel now to check the original location of the story. Just like the location, this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and strange and absolutely not for everyone. This is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not really forget this film, it's indelible. Yet, over the years, I had forgotten its existence. I do not know anyone who has seen it, who has never read it, or seen any reference to it. Erendira is a name so unusual that I had even forgotten the title. Well, I'll try to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** Since I was in this article, I have become a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and I regret not having read it before. <br /> <br /> Related to MsMyth's comment below; the film was shot in Mexico but the author is Colombian and in no way commented on Mexico or the history of this country, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying desperately to find a copy of this movie for my library. Loved the movie? You must read the story, then everything that Garcia Marquz has written. And, by the way, the place of origin of the story was Colombia.
