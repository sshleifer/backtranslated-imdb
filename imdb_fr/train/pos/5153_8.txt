In Christian Duguay's film, Hitler: The rise of evil, the first years of Hitler's life and politics are illustrated with success, with some minor historical errors and some exaggerations. It is quite natural that a Hollywood film contains such elements that the main purpose of the production is the income it will get from the film. Even though such errors may disappoint some audience members who think that everything should be done in the book, I think most of them fit well with the rest of the film, which makes it more interesting. We must not forget that this film is not a documentary. Who cares about how his dog died anyway? <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Hitler is described as a psychologically unstable character who gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals. But he has not been described as a super villain, but rather as an ambitious politician. I think it's a good prospect because the film is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions, which made the film somewhat objective. Yes, he was a little crazy and his methods were rough, but he was still a human being, not a totally crazy figure as described in "Inglorious Bastards". I think that made the film more realistic, even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history is reflected in the audience. Although the film focuses on Hitler, we also had the chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions through newspapers, discussions about people and songs in a Jewish cabaret. The reaction of the company was also reflected in the cinema but was very limited. The fights of the journalist Fritz Gerlich and the ironic plays in the cabaret were fun and interesting, but that was it. Most of the time, we have only seen his followers go wild on the streets and cheer him on. <br /> <br /> Another thing that was missing in the film is information about the origins of his hatred of the Jews. At the beginning of the film, some ideas about it were given, but they were rather superficial. Suddenly, it was a politician who spoke of the need to exterminate the Jews. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Hitler: The rise of evil can not be considered an excellent film that will please everyone, but it is not unsatisfactory at all. If you can stand the directors who change their story for money, it's an interesting film that successfully reflects Hitler's personality.
