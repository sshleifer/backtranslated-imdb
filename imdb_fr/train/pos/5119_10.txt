I just have to say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I can not even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time his camera covered his body after he was completely shaved, he was beautiful for his first trip to Gilley, I was amazed. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as Bud's naive young wife, but with the attitude necessary to be married to a stubborn and hardworking cowboy. If you are not a fan of country music, what I am not, is a soundtrack that will make you sing with every word. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie, it will not disappoint you.
