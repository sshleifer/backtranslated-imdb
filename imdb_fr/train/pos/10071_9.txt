When tradition dictates that an artist transmits his skills and magic to an heir, the old and proud street show, known to all as "the king of masks", becomes desperate for a young apprentice to adopt and cultivate. His warmth and humanity, however, find him paying a few dollars for a small person displaced by devastating natural disasters in China, in this case massive floods in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> He takes his new companion 7 years on his straw barge, to live with his precious and beautiful monkey, "General", before discovering that this child is a granddaughter. <br /> <br /> life is transformed instantly, because the love he feels for this little slave mingles with the amazing tradition that requires him to transmit his art only to a young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories inside this one. ... many people are affected and the culture of China opens to our Western eyes. Thousands of years of heritage can be summed up in a cup of theater and few people leave this DVD with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not great because I found sound levels everywhere. the counter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
