I just want to say that I'm so happy that someone finally gave up talking about this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This film is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking. Especially for a student movie! I just want to thank Spazz for taking the absurd time to find such a rare photo and then comment! Most people I know do not have this time, especially if they end up reading it. Congratulations to you sir! Anyway, the film follows a thin scenario, to say the least incredible and simply stupid. I understand the idea of ​​creating a satire Charlie's Angels, but why engage actresses as atrocious! Also, what kind of director has acted, written, produced and edited the photo too! Choose a job and put all your love in the man! It's a shame because I heard he made a good movie about a deadly toothbrush. Once again, thanks to Spazz for pulling the curtain on this film, people like you are a rare find.
