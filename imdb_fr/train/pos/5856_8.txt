Classified E (contains violence). <br /> <br /> I owned the original Spiderman PC game for a few years now. I still have not beat it, because under Windows XP there was a problem So be warned if you have XP.But for those who do not have XP, try this game. It's a fun family game and clean, with action and advantage for any Spiderman fan.In the game you play Spiderman and you face various criminals who commit crimes.Spiderman is a fun little game that I recommend to any fan of Spiderman or to a parent who wants a fun and clean game for their kids. <br /> <br /> 8/10
