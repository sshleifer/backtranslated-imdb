In this movie, the year 2022 looks a lot like the seventies. It's fun at first, but the viewer soon realizes how different this futuristic, decadent world is, despite appearances, how many things we take for granted may become unavailable. <br /> <br /> The characters often interact in a particular way. without tact, without manners or respect. I think it's intentional, not bad to act. After all, witnesses to the social changes that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s suggest that by 2022, the inhabitants of an overcrowded city behave in this way. <br /> <br /> I did not like most action scenes, except the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. The plot is not too polite. But the big scenes and ideas - like the death of Sol, the way rioters and corpses are treated, the "furniture" - outweigh the flaws of this movie. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
