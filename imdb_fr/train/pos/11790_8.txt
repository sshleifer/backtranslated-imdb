The new short film by David Lynch is a very "lynchian" piece, full of darkness, tension, silences, discreet but very textured background music, and again presents two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurring theme from his work. <BR/> <br /> The two characters create a very intriguing slave-mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow-up of the same kind of relationship as that described in Mulholland Dr. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. For Lynch fans. <br /> <br />
