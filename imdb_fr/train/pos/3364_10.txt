I, too, was very surprised to find that few people voted for this film and I WOULD have had to write something about it, even though my comments are very similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I like a lot about the movie. The superb acting between Mastroianni and Loren. The way the film is told: humanity and love develop slowly between these two strangers and contrast with the inhuman and continually inhuman pace of the announcer of fascist radio (who happens to be a colleague of the role of Mastroianni ) and members and coming from the show. "For me, it's a very good film about what the human being is, some of you may say that the anti-fascist" message "is too clear, but for me, it did not destroy the film My vote is 10/10.
