Why this film has almost disappeared in the dark is an absolute crime. "Conan" is perhaps the only film of sword and witchcraft best. The brutal violence, the cool character designs and the good rhythm make this dream one of the best fantasies of the moment. It is certainly the biggest animated film I have ever seen and intended for a more adult audience. It's not like Bakshi's usual frenetic style. It's all a start for Bakshi and, in my opinion, his best work. I hope this film will get the recognition it deserves.
