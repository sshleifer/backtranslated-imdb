Having seen most films of Ringo Lam, I can say that this is his best film to date, and most unusual. It is an old antique porcelain piece full of exceptional martial arts, where the location of an underground lair of traps and dungeon plays a role as important as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and fun and the scenery is truly memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise is not available on DVD and is virtually impossible to get your gloves, even if you approach the second porcelain largest city in North America (like me). If you can find it, do not let it pass.
