Absolutely fantastic trash ... this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions, etc. later in the movie (you will have to watch it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I will not bother to go down in history because it is way too long and uninteresting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - look at the nap flight scene to understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were both pretty good and spoiled by poor quality gore. Effects that resembled those of the team that made City of the Walking Dead (that is, strange bloody blood spurting from neck wounds). <br /> <br /> if they manage to find a copy - it is rather rare and I never see anyone bother to republish it, which will make it even rarer in a few years. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I 'll only recommend it for the beautiful Belinda Mayne nude scenes! This lady is a fox!
