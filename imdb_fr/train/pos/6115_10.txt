Have you ever wondered how far a movie could go? <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of extreme with Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggravated writer, a killer and an addict idiot who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and madness. Led by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist manikin, Harry begins his killing. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Atkins presents the first installment of the most vile story ever filmed <br /> <br /> The only other film I've seen of this type would be the second installment entitled Necromane schizophrenic <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget movie and will not suit everyone, but if you're looking for something unsettling, different and awful, you'll make an excellent choice . <br /> <br /> DO NOT ATTEND THE HORROR OF A MODERN DAY (like Scream) <br /> <br /> The spectator's discretion is advised
