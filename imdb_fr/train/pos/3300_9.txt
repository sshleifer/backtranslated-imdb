Pakeezah has a very interesting story (which is well documented in the "Anecdotes" section) about its origin. It seems that fate conspires to test Kamal Amrohi (the director) while secretly wishing to see him finish his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah rides metaphors, poetry and visual elocution. As a result, the intensity with which emotions emerge gives a dimension that may not be very real but is very effective and leaves an impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari saw the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan as her own. The other stars of the film are, besides her, Ghulam Mohammed (the musical director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (score) and Joseph Wirsching (the d.o.p). Their music and their cinematography will leave you bound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic of world cinema. It reveals new layers every time you look at it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the few film poets and he left us a gift.
