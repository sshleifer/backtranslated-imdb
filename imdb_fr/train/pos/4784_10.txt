It's good to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is absolutely convincing as Robert Farnsworth's simple yet friendly girl, <br /> <br /> who in his last role finally shows how good he is. It's hard to believe it's a David Lynch movie. It's slow and even, sweet and moving. One of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes and violence.
