The Straight Story is a multi-level exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. On one level, a slow walk through the heart of the country, its friendly inhabitants and the amber grain, on another level, on aging and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not is not). David Lynch gives us time in this film and helps me remember that so much can be said with silence. A remarkable film that will stay soft with me for a while.
