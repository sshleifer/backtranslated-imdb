It turned out to be a classy production with what had to be a small budget. The variety of characters is incredible, dwarves wielding the ax to the ghouls of 7 feet! I enjoyed the relationship between the sons, not too sentimental, but romantic enough to maintain interest. I also enjoyed the mix of humor (which can be very easy to go wrong, too much / not enough), which means it was neither too dark nor too spoofy. It was a big step forward compared to the other efforts of Eave, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of scenario and production. They have an excellent website that is worth seeing. I can not wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
