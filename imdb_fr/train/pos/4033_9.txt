Many critics have made it a point to note that Pinjar was different from the Bollywood manufactured films. While this is true, Bollywood films are generally adapted to a specific audience and must be appreciated to achieve their goals in this regard. <br /> <br /> However, Pinjar is an excellent movie for those looking to get out of the normal. Bollywood movie based on the equation. Located at the time of partition between India and Pakistan, Pinjar addresses a Punjabi girl victim of societal and cultural attitudes towards the treatment of women of her time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between a life with a man who abducted her and the ephemeral hope of a life with her family in the Punjab, an Indian kingdom. More than a problem of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar approaches and defines the role of a woman as a girl, as a wife and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. In contrast to the typical films of Bollywood who are evasive in nature, makes his audience reflect on these questions during and after the film.
