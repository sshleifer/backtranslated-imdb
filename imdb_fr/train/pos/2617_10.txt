I watched Lion King more often than all my friends put together. Have a little sister ... you know what it is. Now I have memorized the plot and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out, it was okay, let me see ... the second was a lot weaker ... so I saw an announcement for Lion King 1 and 1/2. .. I was like ok, we go back. After watching the 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for the rehearsal) were broken. A really beautiful and original plot allows you to stay stuck to your seat all the time. I noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao will apply 100% here. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend seeing it.
