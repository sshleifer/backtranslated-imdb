Lost holds something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and a lot has been said. I will not be the one who will explain everything to you. Just read the people who liked it and you will understand why you want to watch it. The good thing about this series is that it's totally new. There are not many movies - let alone - suspense-themed series, but Lost is proud of the theme. That's all that is unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic place, nice twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in single episodes), you will get a series in which each episode is a story . clean but part of a bigger story. You want to have all the information about the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you want to know where the writers lead you. The result is that it's a series that will not let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series has dropped a bit in season 2, likely due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was only written for one season and that when the huge success followed, the writers were also overwhelmed. In my opinion, they made the mistake of adding even more mysteries and at a faster pace in Season 2, and then solving those (or at least partially) those of Season 1. At the end of the season 2, you ended up with a big blur. secrets, twists and unexplained phenomena, but the viewer can only bear too much. The difference between seasons 2 and 3 was however huge. Season 3 gave a lot of ideas, to partially replace them with new questions. And that's exactly how they should write. you want to deceive scenario into scenario, do not have a tsunami of secrets scattered about you and pick up a few to explain the viewers. They got that in season 3 and bring us a promising future for the 4-series. It's good to see that a format of such a different series can be so popular.
