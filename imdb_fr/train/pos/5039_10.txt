Stunning. Absolutely stunning. It's a film about two children whose father suddenly has a vision. He claims that an angel visited him and told him that they had to kill "demons". He receives instructions later and they begin to gather the demons, which are to the naked eye of ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax in their heads and chop them, burying them in the rose garden. Their father says he can see their sins when he touches them. The film continues, with a final touch. <br /> <br /> What I like about this film is that it perfectly captures the fragility of human perception. Is their father completely angry? Or does he tell the truth? The public is left to decide. Go judge for yourself and see the movie. Now.
