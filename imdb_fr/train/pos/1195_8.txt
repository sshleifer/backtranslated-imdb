I saw this film about twenty years ago during the last show. I still remember the film very well, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought that Taylor was underestimated as an actor, as most critics considered him a strong, almost dull man, and women just loved watching his movies because of his appearance. This film, however, proved how much he could be an interesting actor. He did not have enough roles like this one during his long career. This is his best performance. He's totally believable in a really nasty role. From what I read, he was a very hardworking and easy-going guy in real life and never fought enough for that kind of role. He would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how much of Lloyd Nolan's character was annoying. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really pissed me off. The last scene of the film stayed with me for all these years. This film is really worth a look.
