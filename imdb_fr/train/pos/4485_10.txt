This is my favorite Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 40's. The original version of Mammy Two Shoes is part of Ensemble 2 of Tom & Jerry's Spotlight Collection, a disc, and presents the wonderful detailed animation of first cartoons. The gags of this one are not all crazy Avery kind, but more subtle and intended for all those who never watch late in front of horror movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a scary radio show and Jerry decides to play him a number of tricks to frighten him. The gag of nine lives is well done here, and I do not know how many times I tried to make a void and a scary leaf when I was a child. When the owner of Tom woke up the ruckus - Mammy was NOT the housekeeper, it was her house - she has a big surprise, with a big laugh. Prepare your pause button, it's worth it!
