This supernatural thriller by Peter Weir is truly one of the most fascinating and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain achieves his best performance as an Australian lawyer defending a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As he gets closer to the case, he finds out more about the main accused, Chris, and especially about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, who seems to be a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary rains seem to confirm the indigenous prophecy of the coming of the last wave, that which will drown the world. <br /> <br /> Dream sequences and supernatural effects reinforce this film and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are strong in supporting roles, as well as the tough-name guy who plays Charlie, the old Aboriginal who can turn into an owl. The climax and the end do not disappoint, unlike many other supernatural thrillers that fall flat after an hour or two. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is also a drama that speaks of spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
