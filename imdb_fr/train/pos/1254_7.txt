Ed Harris's work in this film lives up to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen from everyone he shares it with, including the great Sean Connery. . The film, which is more than a little moralistic, comes to life only in the scenes where Harris is interrogated by the lawyer of another convict. It's amazing, a master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> Other members of the cast are all followers and Connery is reliable, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself does not go away. The plot largely depends on the principle that a black prisoner will always be ill-treated and coerced by white law enforcement officers. It is the engine that makes the story true or false, and gives the impression that one feels a little deceived in the end. <br /> <br /> That said, it's good to watch to see Harris in action.
