Guys and dolls must be one of my favorite music movies. It's a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals - musicals have been designed to entertain, not to preach. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago, great musicals and good movies, but they can not bring us a solid, unconditional entertainment. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy does not know how to sing! It was very annoying to hear him sing and talk when I could not understand him. If there had not been Marlon, I would have given 10 stars to this man. Guys and Dolls offers old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely have these days. Watch it to have a good time !!
