This James Link game is the best link game I've played in my life. This is my favorite James link game so far because: <br /> <br /> The missions of this game are really fun and can be very difficult. more fun to play the missions have a lot of actions the weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are great. Car missions have a lot of action and are really fun to play. The actors of the voiceover are really good and it's cool that Sean Connery plays the voice for James Bond. The style of the links is really cool because it looks like Sean Connery when he played James Bond in the movies and the other character looks pretty much the same as the look in the movie. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. Plus, the game follows the movie pretty much but not everything but most of the time it's cool. <br /> <br /> overall score ********** on ***** *****
