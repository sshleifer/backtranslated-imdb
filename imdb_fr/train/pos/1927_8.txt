When GEORGE NADER died on February 4, 2002, I thought of this extremely interesting program which, even if it only had a short-term program, was a great idea with good scenarios. Generally invisible for more than 40 years, it would be interesting to see it again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was an excerpt from COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, riding his famous rocket sled, where he was often called "the fastest living man".
