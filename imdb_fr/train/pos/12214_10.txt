This low-budget digital video film has assets in the right places: write and play. In addition, digital photography is the best of the lot so far. In low light conditions, the typical digital video tone prevails, but, surprisingly, it rivals filmstrips in terms of brightness, clarity, and saturation in bright light. It's a staple movie that runs at its best with an animated dialogue about some kind of "Midnight Cowboy" story about scriveners doing everything they can to survive in the urban city of San Francisco.
