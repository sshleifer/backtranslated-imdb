The best treasure island ever made. They just do not have any more <br /> <br /> movies like these, or ever. Nobody makes such films. More than a novelty, this film is funny, frank and fascinating, but in a bad mood, mysterious and morose. This is one of my favorite photos. The director <br /> <br /> must have an idea of ​​what it is, but it certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations, leaving only little imagination. Why he has not made more movies like this, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> While reminding me of some of the best blacks, it is one of a kind. But this <br /> <br /> is not made for idlers or singles.
