Two workers in conflict in a leather goods store turn out to be secret lover since they correspond under pseudonyms of box number. In this simple idea and in an everyday setting, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, poignancy and irony that never fails. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as an average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own intrigues and jokes. Although Stewart's big films on 39/40 have wrongly eclipsed him (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr. Smith), he is easy to match and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtitles that the others movies do not show.
