I am the parent of a child with special needs and I really liked the movie! It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see humor in things. I especially thought it was nice to see how all the other characters were worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after the death of his grandmother. Before editing the film, I attended a targeted screening of the film with other parents and siblings of children with special needs. Everyone enjoyed the film and it inspired some nice discussions. We talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them. The scriptwriter explained how she volunteered with children with autism and other special needs children for several years. She based the character on a real person. Our family has a sense of humor that has allowed us to go through very stressful times. I give the film two bravo !!!
