The jokes are obvious, the gags are tacky and the characters are fantastic characters - but I could not help but laugh at his extremely entertaining movie. No matter how many times I see it, it fascinates me and I highly recommend it to all fans of crazy entertainment. It contains many moments to quote, and some of the best visual gags I've seen so far. If you've had a bad week and need a chuckle, rent it home on Friday night to start your weekend.
