A surprisingly effective thriller. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a professional and successful couple, he is a writer and a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and in an act of compromise Mulder accepts the move as long as they visit sites of historical interest regarding famous serial killers along the way. His idea: he writes the words, she takes the photos, resulting in a bestselling coffee table book that will prepare them for life. To help finance the trip, they decide to carpool and announce the fact. Brad Pitt sees the announcement and shortly after killing his owner, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, meet the writer couple and begin their journey in cross-country. Inevitably, mischief ensues. <br /> <br /> Pitt is notable as a truly inspiring Early Grayce, and is ably supported by Lewis playing his usual "white trash" character that seems to be his default setting. Duchovny and Forbes also form a convincing double act and, as events escape uncontrollable, the viewer is drawn into his spell and feels the tension ignite. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, sinister and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition beyond its current status. A top movie.
