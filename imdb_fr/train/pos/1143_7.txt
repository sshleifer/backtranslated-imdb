I do not look at soaps. My grandmother always looks at this one with the hourglass. I laughed at them when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this film takes parody and defines it in a new way. I found the story damn funny. The fashion of the '80s - epaulettes, sequins and polyester - is just the thing. Gigantic hair, high heels and histrionics - what a combination. <br /> <br /> And all the actors are just going to town, chewing on their roles and spitting them into a big, well-scripted pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him again when he had such potential, before the tabloids. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see it on film? Leesa Gibbons - she had not missed it, but to include her as a real life entertainment journalist (and where do you post for THAT job?). <br /> <br /> Certainly, I could have done without it. Sally climbs the drainpipe. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times ?, Like every actress from Carol Burnett to I do not know who and I'm so finished now, I could spit peanuts if I had them. Apparently, that's what you do when you're funny in a big building in New York. I'm just grateful that they did not take out the flagpole. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, there were twists in the intrigues, there was a generic ending before, it was common, there were clothes worthy of a second look, there was an excellent cast and he has personal memories for me. Really, what do you need more?
