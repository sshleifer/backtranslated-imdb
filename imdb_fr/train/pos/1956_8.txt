In fact, I think this film is more an example of an easy target than a really bad movie. In fact, the film is very well done in many ways and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the scenario is a bit complicated, but it's the kind. The film has a black atmosphere centered on a femme fatale. Like all the old classics of the black, this one has a scenario that distorts you so that you do not always understand it at first, and it can be difficult if you think too much and try to put all the pieces together. It's the kind. In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to let the viewer guess and, in turn, surprise, without giving up the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that she looks great and speaks of her two-way dialogue so as to turn it into something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> The direction is more than passable, because face-to-face that - you have to keep an audience interested in the "has she or not?" question for two hours. In addition to a sinuous scenario and a fun performance of Stone, this is done effectively through the creation of a black atmosphere at once dark and very hard and modern at the time, with straight industrial lines going hand in hand with those of Stone. sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press the pause button anywhere and you'll notice something interesting. <br /> <br /> The film also relies on whimsical elements of the first film and transforms them into something a little more real. , especially sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... what a shock!" is treated here more simply and, as a rule, the sexuality of the film is better used. It is always moving, but not as easily for the shock value and the buzz as in the first case. I will not say it's not a gadget yet, because, let's face it, this movie is supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And it's a funny movie. It may be an easy target, but if you watch him for what he is: a black, a femme fatale, twisted, sexy, who did or does not-that-dunnit, you will surely enjoy it (no pun intended).
