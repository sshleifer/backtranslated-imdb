Next Film by Cheech & Chong (1980) is the second film to present a duet by Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The adorable burned smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building looking for ways to smoke more and stay laid all day. But Cheech is the "responsible". He has a job and a stable girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants to put his freak on it so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem also arises, Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech is another role) is in town and wants to stay with him. Thinking he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech Chong and Red pawns. In which adventures will Chong and Red live? Will Cheech have his monster? How long will Chong go without smoking? Watch the next Cheech & Chong movie to find out! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong takes the reins of the staging for the sequel. He gained some experience doing uncredited work on UP IN SMOKE. Funny but not as good as the first movie. But fans of Cheech and Chong will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
