For my part, I have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season and I hope that the writers' strike will not end abruptly the beginning of a very good show. Ned is a pastry chef who owns a downtown restaurant and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator who has his own quirks, like his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is the childhood friend of old, but not more sunny, and the sunny place of Ned's life. Olive is the jealous but generous waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings together all the characters with his marvelous narration of the series. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson, with Olive and sometimes the dog, solve many mysteries of murder with the help of Ned's special gift of bringing the dead back to life. The show is funny, clean and romantic in a very cute and warm way, and I would recommend it to anyone.
