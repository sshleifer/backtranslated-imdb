Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist master of the first order, expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change are at the heart of his work. I bought her first book several years ago and my family marveled at it several times. It was therefore a pleasure to personally know the artist through this film. He is as patient and kind as expected, and he has wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest of which are expressed by his occasional incapacity. to say it with words. He is like most children who play alone in the open spaces (if they still do), creating things out of sticks, sand, mud and snow before they get too big. Mr. Goldsworthy has been entrusted with the gift and the mission of extending this type of game to create a deep vision of nature and open his eyes, often tired, in a new way. And always with the greatest respect, the gratitude and humor of a wandering and inquiring monk.
