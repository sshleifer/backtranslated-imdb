I saw this movie on Sky Cinema not so long ago .. I must admit that it was a very good western that features two of the biggest names. On one side is Charlton Heston, who plays the infamous retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. On the other side, the late James Coburn played by the evil Zach Provo, seeking revenge for Burgade, whatever the price! <br /> <br /> The good news of this movie is that there were some great characters. Most of the actors played the stage very well .. Especially James Coburn, whom I think was really mean in this movie .. But it was like that ... <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum Who I have seen everywhere in other movies .. Play Hal Brickman .. I felt that his character was left out in the cold, but he managed to pull himself together by teaming with Burgade, to bring down the armory Provo! <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a very good movie. Very good to watch. Excellent score of the late Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> Beautiful piece of western character ..! 8 out of 10
