In the hands of actors less important than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film could have become silly and banal. But, with these two experienced experts in mind, I found "Silence Fury" as a little mystery of the most exciting and enjoyable. When their marriage is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was the best man of this marriage, one can feel that there is some kind of conspiracy against her at work. While Colbert, Ryan and his lawyer begin to refute the claim of a previous marriage made by a foreigner, they meet at any time additional evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is already married. Even if it's not hard to know who the main villain is, it's still fun to increase the intensity and pace of the story. All in all, it's a solid and mysterious film with great performances from both main actors and a beautiful cast that includes the often underrated Paul Kelly.
