This show is good. I like the acting, the fun elements and the kindness of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, they all did great in the show. The series got off to a great start with its amusing and illogical basic idea of ​​bringing back the dead in the first series and honestly, as people say, the first episodes of the second series were a little disappointing, but they came back later . good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it's going to be canceled. Why does not ABC let him finish until the end when all the episodes are already over? I really want to know how the story will unfold. I think we should give it a chance, because there are still a lot of viewers who like it.
