I do not have much to add to what has been said before, but it's really a film of its time and the first (and probably the only) time the studio has totally suspended the film at the Dead End Kids. <Br /> <br /> The Warners helped the boys a lot, from director Ray Enright to an "A" budget, to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. At each turn, we get one of these gems performances from real pros. They are too numerous to list, but it seems that almost everyone on the fate of Warner (Without the biggest stars) scrolls this image. (See if you can see John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> The only performance that exceeds is that of Eduardo Cianelli, always reliable, as leader of the Mafia with a Messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of the leader Thuggie in "Gunga Din". It is something to watch! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role since "Dead End". <br /> <br /> My offer for this one is a second feature film on a double bill with something like "City for Conquest". <br /> Hooray for the horns!
