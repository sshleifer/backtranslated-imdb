It's certainly not my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is not my favorite actress, but I found the film almost totally beautiful. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who plays Miss Bates are absolutely great. The detail of the period is not alienating; the sensation of the film is just, actually. But the real "find" is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. There could not be a more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr. K in the novel, but I found him wonderfully human and humane in the film. The beauty of Northam and his smiling eyes are not an obstacle to enjoyment! Highly recommended. Anar
