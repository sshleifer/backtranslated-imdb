And it's not because since her days on "Clarissa Explains It All" that I fell in love with Melissa Joan Hart, who at that time was very popular, but still managed to have roles teenager. "Sabrina, the teenage witch" was Hart's next big jump after her days "Clarissa". According to the comics, Sabrina Spellman is - you guessed it! - a teenage witch who tries to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of teenagers' daily lives. She is helped in her efforts by her two aunts and a wise black cat as she goes from high school to university and then to her journalism career. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hart is the heart soul series. "Sabrina, the teenage witch" is very moving and very funny, and it's a pity it took so long to realize how awesome it was. I just wish there were new episodes that we could all benefit from. <br /> <br /> 10/10
