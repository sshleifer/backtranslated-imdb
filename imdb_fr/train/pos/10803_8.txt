I do not understand. Not being a critic, I do not evaluate the quality of acting, which I find credible, a good thing. My confusion lies in the content. No one else is aware that these two unfaithful women justified their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country. Should there not have been a prologue informing us that the men are going home and, if so, what effect has their misleading infidelity on their "wives" had? While these women cashed their love for loneliness, did they think their husbands enjoyed getting shot at as they faced death or daily mutilation? They did not think at all of their husbands! Only of themselves. Forgive me except when they wished the death of their husband.
