I really think this movie is great, personally. But, in every film, there is a misfortune. Some of you may not have watched Hilary Duff's "Raise Your Voice", but if you think about it, these two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In "Brave New Girl", Holly wants so much to go to the Haverty Conservatory. In 'Raise Your Voice', Terri wants to go to a conservatory in Los Angeles (do not remember the name of the conservatory there). They are both in the music business and have to sing at the end of the semester. It's really funny how these two movies look alike. Personally, I like Brave New Girl better than Raise Your Voice.
