Having seen "Fear of a Black Hat" and "This is Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that, while being similar, both films are really worth seeing. There will be many times in "Fear" that will make you hysterical. It is not surprising that both films have such a cult. "Fear" will be available soon on DVD. Rent it if you must, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
