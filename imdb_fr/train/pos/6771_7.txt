so yes, he's pretty nostalgic to watch the first episode, because that's the one I really remember. I like watching the first season and yes, compared to the action-packed shows we have now, this show seems like nothing. but frankly, I like the "less violent" part of the series and the scenario has more substance than the new ones. I found it interesting that Airwolf de Belisario and JAG have a similar theme: the lead actor (Hawke and Harm) are both looking for a member of the MIA family (brother, father). I wonder if Robert Belisario's personal life reproduces the theme of these two programs. <br /> <br /> Question: Does anyone have pictures of Hawke's booth? I love this cabin (a bit like a dream cabin) and this is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
