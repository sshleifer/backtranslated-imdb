What do you do with a 14-inch porn star armed with drugs and murder, then dead from AIDS? You make a movie, of course. The probable reason why this was not done earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been an obstacle to his production. It is no coincidence that the film was shot shortly after Nash's incarceration. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is its speed. There is no time wasted on useless shit. And why would that be? There is too much material here to require matte filling scenes. The casting is good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a series of films, so here is finally a role that suits him perfectly. Bosworth is cute, so the way she acts (she's strong) does not matter. McDermott, who is quite annoying by the way, is pretty good, mostly because he has so much hair on his face that I did not recognize him at first. (I wish they would do the same with Cruise in every movie so I do not have to look at her silly face.) I completely failed to recognize Christina Applegate and I would not have known she was there if I did not. I had not seen his name. final credits. Kudrow is charming as always, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only questionable casting choices were Carrie Fischer's early-cameo cameo and the utterly absurd inclusion of Janeane Garofalo, the idiotic You also thought to include Paris Hilton, did not you? No, I think Hilton is the perfect choice for her 10-second appearance as a stupid bitch. Because the film speaks of decadence, among others ?? and about a porn actor ?? it fits perfectly.
