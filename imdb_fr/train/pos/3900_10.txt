It's at the top of my list of the most hysterical shows I've ever seen. I laughed so much that I'm sure I missed half of the jokes. This presents Izzard as a brilliantly talented actor. What I particularly like is that he never seems to "belittle" content intended for his audience. His timing is impeccable and the routine is linked as a performance rather than a series of gags. Thumb up.
