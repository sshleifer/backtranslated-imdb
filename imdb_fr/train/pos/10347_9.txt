A delightful little film, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama as skillfully as Lieutenant Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) reconciles his dedication to his daughter Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to the force as an outstanding detective. <br /> <br /> This hodgepodge may not appeal to all viewers today, but in his day he had something to offer to all members of the film family, and the resolution of the somewhat tired scenario between feeling and duty is original and refreshing, and well worth the wait. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Mr. Williams" contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in the history of cinema, and his brilliant comic strip shines. Melvyn Douglas, ridiculously ridiculous, delivers some of the best replicas: "I would walk in Main Street with a Turkish towel before letting a woman control my life!" And the effervescent Joan Blondell leaves his pikes flying with a typical aplomb: "Good sorrow! You look like my aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> The resolution of crimes here is a standard price, although many actors help to bring the subject to life. <br /> <br /> From the current point of view, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" is perhaps more interesting for his insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct, all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries. Although most of the genre commentaries unfold in a superficial battle of the sexes, they are sometimes both subtle and penetrating, playing not only in some of the finer details of the film, but also in the battle of genres that culminates in the final scene.
