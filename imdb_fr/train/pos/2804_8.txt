The title of this film almost discouraged me from watching it. Not being a fan of Manchester United, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit boring, but I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film spun with me without ever looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you liked East is East, you'll love this movie. OK, so the plot is nothing new and the classic intrigues are contained in the film, but everything is done in a very fun way and with a breath of fresh air. The film moves very fast and entertains the audience. The occasional funny moments are a good laugh and not a bad attempt at humor, and best of all it's a good British comedy.
