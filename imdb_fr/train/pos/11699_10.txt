I have seen this movie a dozen times and it's great. But the only thing with that is that at the beginning, there was too much talk of who was coming out with whom. I think it would be interesting to make a remake of it. But on the official website, they said they would not remake because many people were saved by watching it. What happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a very good actress. She shot several other movies in the '70s and' 80s, but we have not heard from her since. I know for sure that Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for accounting at RD Films. But overall, I must say that the series itself is like a left to the old school.
