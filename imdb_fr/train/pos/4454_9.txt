Virgil Manoven is an old man who lives alone in his isolated rural farm. In the company of his beloved cat one morning in the woods around his property, Manoven sees what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods. He is troubled by troubling visions, he investigates further and is finally driven to a scary orphanage where events take a supernatural turn. "Soft for Digging" is a fantastic experimental horror with a lot of scary atmosphere. This minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue. Some scenes are truly nightmarish and the acting is excellent. The filming scene is a panic: Maryland wood is comparable to that used in "The Blair Witch Project". Horror movie a chance.9 out of 10.
