I only read good things about this movie and finally got the chance to watch it late last night and that was all I expected and more. This is the way a horror movie should be. I think the reason was scary because it was so realistic. The spooky invitation score was perfect for creating a dark mood. I loved the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed the rest of the movie. It was very easy to follow and understand, unlike some movies too complicated.The special effects I'd love to see more horror movies like this. It's easily one of my favorites. A realistic storm would have created a pleasant atmosphere for this film.Other then he had all the elements of a good horror I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can enjoy a good horror movie that does not pull fists. will add to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
