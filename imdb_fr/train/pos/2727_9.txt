One of the best movies about real crime ever made and very faithful to the book of Truman Capote who invented the genre of the novel about real crime. The haunted musical score of Quincy Jones and the formidable interpretation of Scott Wilson and Robert Blake in the role of Dick and Perry, the killers. Why did not Wilson become a big star after this movie became a mystery to me? <br /> <br /> The black and white cinematography and editing in this film are top quality. The recreation of the murders is frightening and, since it leaves the real murders to your imagination, even more frightening than if they had shown that the shotgun was triggered. The film was shot in the Clutter house, which had been sold to another person after the killings. The film has a very documentary feel - in addition to scenes from Clutter House, other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores where the assassins went. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer plays an important role as a prosecutor in the short trial scene that is not only filmed in the courtroom but also by several of the Clutter murder jurors posing as the jury of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a solid movie, scary every time you see it.
