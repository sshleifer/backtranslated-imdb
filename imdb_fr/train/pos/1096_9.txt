I saw this film for the first time in 1980 in the midday spot. After many subsequent views (and the purchase of the video), it still makes me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in a wealthy American middle class - but well executed. well executed. But it's also a document of his age - a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the nascent consumer era. This film is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful sophisticated leading actors - the urban Melvyn Douglas; Cary Grant confused; Daffily determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and form a team of memorable characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "It means we have to explode", "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little pig". <br /> <br /> like it.
