William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder took place years ago, in a very bad state, in order to restore it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends with their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, strange events occur in the house, including the death of Sophie's cat. In Sophie's birthday party, a pipe leaked blood and they left the place, revealing a secret later. <br /> <br /> "The house that blew to death" is scary and is one of the best episodes of the series "Hammer House of Horror". The fantastic twist, the revelation of a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The house that dies At√© Morrer" ("The house that blew to death")
