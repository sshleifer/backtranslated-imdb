I recommend images that try something different. Many movies just seem to re-edit old ideas, so I highly recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film takes place just after the Second World War. lead the Londoners "barmy". The film is centered on a tiny London neighborhood called Pimlico. They too are tired of not being able to buy what they want but do not see the way out. Until they accidentally fall on a hidden treasure and a charter that officially designated this neighborhood as a sovereign nation several hundred years ago! With this document, they argue, they can get around all the rationing and the good ones and live life as they want because it turns out they are really not British subjects! You will need to see for yourself where the film is going and how the crisis will ultimately be resolved. Let the brilliant minds of Ealing Studios create this gem!
