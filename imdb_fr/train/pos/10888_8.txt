It's one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who believes that money is not enough. He therefore praises the family who live where he thought his family had done. Okay? It's a good little high school soap, PG-13, but the little sexual references are funny. Therefore, if your child can not handle them, he can not live in the real world either. <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a handsome kid and, as usual, walks into this fun OMG, remember what we were doing ..., together piece as if he was at end stage of a neuro-infectious disease. But it does not matter, because even this old Oracle still hopes that if Ben is as well proportioned, well, there is still hope for us, ladies. Fortunately, the rest of the set - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fills and keeps this shady Christmas-Ozzie-Harriet Christmas turn hilarious, comfortable and warm. This film is the kind of popping and popcorn, and when you come back, everyone will want to save it to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, after all, and you'll feel good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There is really something for everyone.
