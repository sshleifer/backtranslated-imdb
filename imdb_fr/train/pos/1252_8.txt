The endless limits of our inhumanity towards our own species never fail to make me dizzy. This truly amazing story of a horribly abused and largely unheard-of population is fascinating, well documented and enraged. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by the behavior of my country and this is just another in our long catalog of international depreciation. We fear. It's probably John Pilger's first documentary I saw, but it immediately made me want to see what else he did. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this parody and the appalling collaboration of the US and British governments, requires that we, the viewers / citizens, be accomplices of our own inaction ... but makes no suggestions on how to help. I do not know Britain, but America has made it almost impossible for citizens to participate in the activities of their government. A move in the right direction could help the cause of these islanders.
