It was excellent. Touch, action packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 stars or more. This film tells the story of an obsolete soldier who learns that it is not only life in life, and that those who learn that there is a time to fight, a need to defend themselves. I cried, I laughed and most of the time I remained admiring in front of this story. Good job writing for an action movie, and the plot was appropriate and pretty solid. The end was not winding, but it was still excellent. If you like to escape from New York or seek the outsiders, this movie is for you. Not an excessive amount of blood or violence, it was not difficult to look in this regard. Something for everyone.
