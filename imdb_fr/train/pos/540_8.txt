actually ... this effect of "video camera", it's just an effect, it's a pretty good .. it's very fun to watch, made for TV, it is not necessary to follow the rules. I have trouble looking at the number 1 because of the way he killed the first girl, it's disturbing. and all the time we ask Judd Nelson to get away, we, the spectators, are on his side. I hope someday we will see a 3rd cabin at the lake but I doubt it. By watching this movie, you will understand how real movies are made, much like a film in a movie. Judd is one of the scariest villains of all time, and he is more realistic: he does not cut people without thinking, as in other horrors.
