If any style of film could be called my "guilty pleasure", it would be this generic type of fantasy. Guilty is not the right word, because I am rather happy to be a fugitive from time to time. "Stardust" is a good fantasy, which one should expect from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman's adaptation, so to speak). This is not Mirrormask's visual dream landscape, it's not Pan's maze's adult pretention and it's not the classic lover of The Bride Bride, but it contains everything the lover Fancy knows enough to be completely comfortable during all the viewing. Fans of fantasy should rejoice - the work on special effects has finally become good enough and cheap enough for this material is now in regular production. <br /> <br /> Stardust's story features a young man named Tristan who, to win the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town, Wall, embarks on the adventure to find a fallen star. To make things difficult, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he is not the only one to look for her. Some witches have greedy eyes about the immortality that the star's heart can give, and the fury of a magical kingdom brother leads the murderous princes in his direction. <br /> <br /> From here, everything is pretty predictable, but it features attractive fantasy elements, warm commentary on the nature of love and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay hacker. On this note, DeNiro's performance is impeccable ... It's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray homosexuals, but a surprisingly effective effect from a person accustomed to being seen as character cast in a typeface (so the joke continues surrounding his character corresponding to DeNiro's own opening). DeNiro is no longer unique to its image from Brazil, and that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Stardust is perhaps the type of film that will last long on the shelves of children and lovers of fantasy. . I can not say that it offers something new, but it's not really there. These are actually the most familiar with its tropes that will appreciate it the most. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
