I think it's a beautiful family movie. There are many hilarious scenes and comforting moments throughout the film. The actors are great and the effects well executed. Danny Glover plays the role of George Knox, who manages the dreaded baseball team "The Angels" and is excellent throughout the film. The young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd are as good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are excellent in this Disney premium film. A touching and comforting film that everyone should appreciate.
