One of the greatest cult classics of Roger Corman, the movie producer for big and small movies, was the Ramones vehicle (originally designed for Cheap Trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. It's a simple, technically out-of-date story (but that would serve extra doses of nostalgic humor, since it's the kind of things that made Napoleon Dynamite's characters fun - see Eaglebauer van) about teenagers who love rock n roll. <br /> <br /> Vince Lombardi high school students face resistance from the director, Evelyn Togar (played by Mary Woronov, the cult's favorite), who fears that Rock N 'Roll will transform children in uncontrollable amoral devours and their promise of an area without rock'n roll. In fact, she intends to eliminate Rock N 'Roll for all students, whether at school or not, and she enjoys the cooperation of most adults who could make sure the plan is a success. <br /> <br /> But not if Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help you. Fanatic of Ramones, she has written some songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School) that she wants to give the Ramones. She tries to do it, but she is repulsed by Miss Togar who does everything in her power to prevent him from going to see the Ramones play in town. It culminates in an ultimate revolt between obsolete adults who hate fun and teenagers (in an end reminiscent of Over the Edge). After years of punk, when the renown of garage rockers, The Ramones (and others) would mark another change in the evolution of music, it was great to see a movie that celebrated the pleasure of playing this way , with such a humorous and exaggerated way. <br /> <br /> It's mostly a light comedy, but an excellent comedy of well-being anyway, when you want something more casual to entertain you. With Jerry Zucker (of the fame of the plane) and Joe Dante (of Gremlins celebrity) both taking part in the realization, you can get an idea of ​​what kind of humor you are (and not to mention, expect to see Dick Miller even if it's only a few minutes in the final of the film). The story had to be inspired later (and therefore updated) by the mid-90s comedy, Detroit Rock City, which slightly changed the vehicle character for glam rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I would recommend passing Corey Feldman's vehicle, Rock N 'Roll Forever High School, published almost ten years later. The original is always the best.
