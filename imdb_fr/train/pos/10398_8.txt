Although time has revealed to us how certain effects have been achieved, this story of love and adventure has always a special meaning. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie before, you'll be surprised how much it was stolen. filmmakers later. I watched this with a friend who was amazed at how well Disney's Aladdin had gotten through the movie. They loved the film and enjoyed the fact that it was a touchstone for many other films and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I attributed the film 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, which is where much of this film lives, because in the last 15 minutes, the film collapses during stimulation. Everything rushes as if they should arrive at the end. From the starting point of the djinn's departure to the end, there seems to be more sketching than finished painting. It does not kill the film, but weakens it. <br /> <br /> The fact remains that viewing is mandatory for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a good movie.
