I grew up in this movie and I remember when my brother and I used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. If you are a parent and have not watched this movie with your children, you should do it, just to hold them in your arms and watch them marvel at the bears and the care! The songs, especially "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this movie to all children so that they can learn how caring someone is nice! When it comes to all the garbage that is on television, you can help your children have the good impression of life with movies like these.
