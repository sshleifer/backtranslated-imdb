The first two thirds of this biopic of the fetish model Betty Page are very interesting. Betty, portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, appears as a nice daughter of the next girl, who saw nothing wrong with what she was doing (and there was certainly nothing wrong with this). Director Mary Harron, who also directed "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white archive footage with new degraded black-and-white images. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety is mainly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a superb performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and executed with talent. The first suppliers of fetish material are not described too condescendingly and we have the impression that these people were part of a narrow "community". Betty has never had too much trouble with her notoriety, although we have the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the world of role play. Since the third act of the film is virtually non-existent, we feel like watching a documentary feature film about Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Apart from the flaws, it's a movie that is worth filming and represents another beautiful feather in the cap of the producer Christine Vachon.
