Relax with this one on a dark and stormy night and get ready to be alternately amused, irritated and frightened. The old grumpy scenario of a ghostly train traveling through the lonely English countryside in the middle of the night is perhaps implausible, but it's a lot of fun. There are wonderful old clich√©s such as "L'ACCIDENT" whose inhabitants remember but do not speak. But the film is above all a way for comedian Arthur Askey to present his particular brand of vaudeville-style humor in the midst of scary scenes. Askey's nerdy humor is not very fashionable these days, but if you let him wash, it can be fun. It's probably the best of Askey's movies.
