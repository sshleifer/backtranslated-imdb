Faithful adaptation of a French novel witty and interesting on a cynical and depressed software engineer (or something of the same age), which relies heavily on the narration in the first person, but that is not so. Downbeat (petty-bourgeois), philosophical and humorous, the best way to describe the film and the novel is that it is a more intellectual character than Charles Bukowski (no lack of respect towards CB). Funny nonsense, but also dark analyzes of social and sexual relations, the great success of the film is that it reflects real life in a sufficiently recognizable way to make you ask: why other films are they not like that ? One of the few examples of a good book making such a good movie.
