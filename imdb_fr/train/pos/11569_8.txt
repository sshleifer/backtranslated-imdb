Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" treats seven minutes of delirious action in a tiny place. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches again, he will receive a dreaded bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a ceaseless chip almost prevents scratching. The caricature switches between the progress of the flea in the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to deal with it. In a beautiful sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can not be scratched, the dog changes color from brown to blue from red to polka dotted plaid! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of itching that only Clampett could do. Several other elements make "An Itch in Time" a pure Clampett. There is the grotesque concept itself, which leads to graphic scenes of the chip nibbling the dog's flesh. There is the unbridled violence that manifests itself in all scenes featuring the cat. More particularly, there are dirty jokes, including a huge dog shot behind that causes the wolf-hissing chip and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch himself by dragging his back on the ground. He interrupts momentarily to address the audience: "Hey, I'd better cut that, maybe I'll like it"! With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make "An Itch in Time" a unique cartoon, based on minutiae. Like a first episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' has almost nothing to do with anything very funny.
