Description very close and very clear of the ebullient and dynamic emotional world of a young man of 18, who makes his first experiences in his gay love with another boy, during holidays with a part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie because of its extremely clear and clear narration, with all these "sound close-ups" and those quiet moments filled with intense moods. <br /> <br />
