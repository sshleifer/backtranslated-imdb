I saw this film at the Taos Film Festival last year and was simply overwhelmed. It is a rich and warm novel on the screen, beautifully interpreted and well done. More than anything, it reminded me of David Lean's films, both in his ability to handle a complex story and his talent for creating powerful scenes that affect you on many levels. The best movie I've seen in years.
