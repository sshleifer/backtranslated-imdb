Chloe is mysteriously saved by Dr. Caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with intellectual abilities from Belle Reve to Project 33.1, and a fraction of a second later, Clark arrives. He finds that Bart Allan has returned to Smallville and meets at Kent Farm. When Lex is captured by Bart during an intrusion into a LuthorCorp installation, Clark discovers that Green Arrow has also hired Bart (aka Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman), and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to study Project 33.1. Clark agrees to join the trio to save Bart and invites Chloe to participate in their mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode of this 6th season so far. In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloé's participation is spectacular, completing the organization necessary for teamwork. In the end, Oliver breaks with Lois based on the importance of fighting criminals and Lex's secret labs around the world. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justiça" ("Justice")
