PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute movie. It is actually a complex overview of children's psychology and an interesting insight into adult development and the artist. In appearance, it is a nostalgic look at some films made in the 80s by a group of children of the upper class. One of the directors of the film, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as artistic director of all the films. Of course, these are just cute kids having fun. But it's also a lot more. Here is a glimpse of times when children are struggling with a number of confusing problems that we all face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world that seems to explode all around us. As we age, we tend to forget how life's realities were superfluous when we were little. <br /> <br /> What makes this film all the more valuable is to see a young Darren Stein become a little filmmaker general. It is clear that Darren is directing this show and that these little films are his vision, but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion surrounding the horrors of adult life. Many children make movies at home, but I have never heard or seen children create "little" films about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to integrate and make friends. These children are confronted and face heavy things! <br /> <br /> The power of this film lies in the way Stein and Shell combine such different scenes with ongoing interviews with children - all now adults and all still friends. This adds a new angle to the film. How many of us have kept in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And, many of the problems they dealt with are still two decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - a love at first sight confession reveals an ever-broken heart, a very normal sexual experience during childhood continues to be a "sticky" subject between two men, resentments persistent about the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in the center of the stage! Which makes perfect sense as these home movies progress over the last two years. Darren Stein is a director. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell take turns talking to each other from time to time and we can not help but imagine the embarrassment that it is to allow us to take a look at the youth of these people. This is especially true for Stein, who has been very successful in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME, we can see the emergence of a little gay boy who tries to understand everything. We also see aspects of the artistic spirit and personality that are not always "nice" or "caring" - and it is a bold move that any artist can share with an audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many revealing moments, but the most troubling and complex moments are a film in which we see a victim of a Jewish concentration camp being tortured and killed by a Nazi . We discover through interviews and stories that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and that the role of the victim is played by a kind child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that sees the dark side of fear and the way children experience the horrors of the adult world beyond the comprehension of adults, let alone that of a child. <br /> <br /> It's a lot more than some personal movies. This documentary captures the pain, the beauty, the joy and the sadness of growing up. Powerful things - and worth the trip! <br /> <br />:
