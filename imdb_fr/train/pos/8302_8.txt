Cannons explode, buildings explode, cars crumble and it's only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This film full of action, featuring a former CIA mercenary who does not seem to seem to die, no matter how many times he has filmed (of where the title), is rather honest. <br /> <br /> resistant, Gary Busey, commonly called bad guy in such films, has his usual charm, but it is a bit more moderate: after all, it's the whole show. This does not mean there are not a lot of great supporting roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, RG Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick Thalmus Rasulala and several other characters from actors 'forgotten' . <br /> <br /> There are plenty of smaller action sequences to keep the whole story: Busey must free a group of American military elites "kidnapped" and send a "supertank" high-tech (a normal tank with a -on glued to the top) back to the states. <br /> <br /> But does America deserve this killing machine more than the bad guys? This question is asked, of course, as in any film centered on the CIA ... but without being preached.
