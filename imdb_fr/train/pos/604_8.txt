As we approach its centenary, Saura has brought together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this soul song par excellence for their country. The twelve "impressions" of the sequel are presented without narrative in a deprived environment, allowing the power of each performance to explode in front of Saura's camera. The creative use of large dishes and large mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection adds dramatic dramatic effects to the varied selections of songs, of dances and instrumental performances. Photographs of Albeniz reappear over the program, connecting the passion of music to its great creator. Saura embraces all Spaniards on its stage, from the elegant elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children who happily dance with their instructors.
