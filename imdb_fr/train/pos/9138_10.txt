I own this movie and have watched it many times over the years since it was released. Prince does not stun us with his phenomenal playing style or anything, he's a musician and I feel that's what he's shown here, he's just the best to tell that story by influence. Most of this film is simple and adolescent, but it is the fault of the directors / writers, it is still a very good film with music even better. Purple Rain's principles and moral beliefs are strong enough, and if more films were based on the basics taught to young children, we would have a better environment as art reflects life that reflects art.
