I did not know what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see that. An intelligent comedy, slightly twisted, that makes you think. I did not really know how a director could create "nothing", but leave that to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals of C.O.R.E. to create another low budget set that looks real (as real as nothing can be). This is well worth your time and money. If you have the opportunity to see it, go for it. You will be glad to have done it.
