Normally, I do not like the series at all. They are all too predictable and tend to become quickly boring and boring. <br /> <br /> However, this series is well played, the story follows all the episodes and even if you miss one, the story will continue catch your mind. <br /> <br /> The episodes are all filmed in a hospital and take you deeper and deeper into the mysteries of dark and old secrets that hide just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital.
