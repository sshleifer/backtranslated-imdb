The Matador is a melodrama full of wit, dark humor and suspense that goes far beyond mediocrity thanks to the two very engaging and sincere interpretations of Pierce Brosnan, who has never been so good as here, and to the faithful Greg Kinnear, who has his best role here ever since. plays Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor in As Good As It Gets. A big plus goes to writing too. An intelligent and sometimes very nasty dialogue is brilliantly delivered by Brosnan and the slow friendship that arises from the construction between these two different individuals is completely convincing. The story takes a few unexpected turns and leaves the viewer constantly in the uncertainty of guessing where he will go. <br /> <br /> Nice artistic contacts on the part of the director, such as the good use of music, a clever editing and an unorthodox cinematography your pleasant for the film and for a long time, you do not know how to label the movie. But it is also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (me anyway) on the edge of his seat.
