I just saw this at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2003 and it was funny as hell. It takes place in Toronto, where these two losers live in this dilapidated house in the middle of a highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just great, because the two losers who want the world to simply disappear. The acting, the dialogue and the writing are very good and the whole film is superb for a low-budget film. The director / screenwriter Vincenzo Natali was present at this screening and he seemed so smart and down-to-earth. This guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well in small budgets, it's shameful big Hollywood budgets!
