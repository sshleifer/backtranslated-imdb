Whether it's three guys in tight tights who are rapping a guy tied up in a string or a girl who says "What's up, dog?" at a bunch of roadkills, there's something everyone at Knuckleface Jones likes. It's strange and surreal and not quite a completely understandable thread ... but it never loses you. The first time I saw it, I nearly laughed myself sick. And every night after, I went home and looked at him again. Forget Coyote Ugly ... it's the movie that cemented my love for Piper Perabo. See it ... before it's too late!
