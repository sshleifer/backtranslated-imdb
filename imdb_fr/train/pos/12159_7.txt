- After their sons are sentenced to life imprisonment, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin to receive threatening phone calls, as someone worries that their sons will not be able to cope easily. The couple decides to move to California to escape the publicity of the lawsuit and start a new life. They start a dance school that meets with success very quickly. One of the students has a rich single father whom Adelle quickly falls in love with. Meanwhile, Helen is raising rabbits and becomes a little too faded by an evangelist on the radio. There is not much time left before everything collapses and women enter a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can not help but compare What's the matter with Helen? to Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ?, also featuring Shelly Winters. Where this film seemed almost restrained in the presentation of Aunt Roo's madness, nothing holds Helen back in this movie. It may take a long time for the film, but once it turns, Helen becomes a Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to make fun of her. Winters is so deliciously insane that it was impossible for me not to appreciate his performance. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but the things Helen is capable of are totally exaggerated. <br /> <br /> - Even if Winters is, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in his role of gold digging tap dancer I had the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would have her named for a price. It's not Citizen Kane! Stop acting so bad. Hey, Debbie, do not realize that your main goal is to be a victim of Winters madness. <br /> <br /> - I love these old stars of the woman at dusk. of horror movies from their career. What's wrong with Helen? is as fun as anything.
