Despite the fact that some critics were particularly warm, I found the story totally captivating and although some critics have described it as "Mills and Boon", so what? It is good to see a warm and touching story of true love in these cynical times. Many spectators sniffed and surreptitiously darted their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert love each other passionately, even if, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I had the impression that Sir John Conroy, who was desperately trying to control the young queen, is perhaps also played like a mean pantomime. As rumor has it that he was actually Victoria's real father (following an affair with his mother, the Duchess of Kent), it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as a young princess, stuck in the stuffy palace with courtiers and politicians ready to handle her. She brilliantly describes the strength of character and determination that ultimately made Victoria a great Queen of England, who flourished as never before under her long reign. I think word of mouth recommendations will guarantee the success of this very nice and beautiful movie.
