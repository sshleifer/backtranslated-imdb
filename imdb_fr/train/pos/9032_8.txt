This may not be the most original way of telling a story, we've seen it all in many movies ... but ... I liked October Sky anyway. There was something, an excellent staging and a good acting from all sides, especially Laura Dern (the teacher) and Chris Cooper (the father). I want to be a rocket engineer! :)
