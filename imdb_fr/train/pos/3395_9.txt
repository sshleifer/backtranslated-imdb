It's a great sci-fi movie that is very strange in the way men and women see the same movie. I talked about the movie to a lot of people and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only film I know that has polarized views on gender. Many women may have less tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots - but whatever the cause, I have always found this difference fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation by Charlton Heston. . This is happening in the near future and the head of the huge Soylent international corporation has been murdered. As the film unfolds, you quickly realize that this is a terrible and extremely unfair future American society. The rich live in beautiful apartments with security and with all the pleasures that money can buy (including the "furniture" - a euphemism for the paid mistresses who come with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are extremely poor, jobless and often live in abandoned cars or apartment corridors. Overcrowding and smog have had serious consequences and the future is really awful! <br /> <br /> Why is the rich man dead and the terrible truth with which he could not live? I really should NOT discuss it - it could ruin the movie for you. However, the film has a great plot and plays and is super exciting to watch. In addition, he stars Edward G. Robinson in his latest on-screen performance as Heston's crisp companion. Although it's not for people who are easily depressed or disgusting, this is an excellent allegorical and profound science-fiction film.
