A good film with - for its time - an intense, sprawling, rather dark story, reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers", although less brutal. The story begins fast and does not give up, with several scenes of very good dialogue between Jeff Webster (Stewart), Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a work by Mann-Stewart, but I found it much less sentimental and more interesting. There are some caveats: an end too fast (and rather sentimental); Corrine Calvert, 24, is not very convincing as a na√Øve French teenager, and the film is of course in Mythic West, a land of fable where the true laws of nations and physics do not apply. not. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares only about himself, and the mountainous landscape is unbeatable. A beautiful drama of western costumes.
