I caught this movie on my local movie channel and I rather enjoyed watching the movie. It contains all the elements of a good movie for teenagers, and more - this film, in addition to dealing with relationships between boys and girls and sex, among others, also deals with the question of the use of steroids by youth. <br /> <br /> The film has that real-life feel - no loud music, no special effects and no scandalous scenes - which, for this film, was right. This feeling makes it easier to relate to the characters in the film, some of whom are probably familiar with our region. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie, fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
