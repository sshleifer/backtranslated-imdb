I watched the McCoy meeting and was happy to see Richard Crenna, Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! It was great to see them now, because I always watched the series grow and when the TV announced that there would be a meeting I was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not understand was why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan was dead. So I went to my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site, so if anyone could tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy ) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I'd be grateful !!) I searched everywhere and no luck.The only thing I could discover about Michael Winkelman is that he was supposed to be born in 1946. This show had value and morality, each show gave a lesson to learn.The shows today do not have it All the cast was amazing, the only thing to do is to meet them. It's impossible if someone can help it !!! Thank you Glenda
