It's not the comedic Robin Williams nor the eccentric / crazy Robin Williams of the recent thriller glory. This is a hybrid of classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with the new love of Robin's thriller. But it's not a thriller, in itself. It's more of a mystery / suspense vehicle through which Williams tries to locate a sick boy and his guardian. <br /> <br /> Also performed by Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this thriller drama plays quite like a storyline, until William The character gets closer to his goal. <br /> <br /> I must say that I had a lot of fun, even though this movie can not teach, guide, inspect or entertain. It was more like watching a guy (Williams) while doing the actions, from the point of view of the third person. In other words, it was true, and I could subscribe to the premise of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth watching, even if it's certainly not the price Friday / Saturday night. <BR/> <br /> It rates a 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
