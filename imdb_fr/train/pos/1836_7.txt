It's time to hit! Director Waqt - Vipul Amrutlal Shah - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by - Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, in the Waqt of Vipul Shah, we have probably found the first real hit of this year. Filled with all the ingredients necessary for a Bollywood commercial rate, "Waqt" has all it takes for a film to click on the Indian public. This is the kind of film that makes the happiness of a distributor and who contemplates his next visit to phoren! In this "saga of Indian emotions" we have a happy family (do not we?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the factor turned millionaire (do not wonder how! ... there is something about selling toys by delivering letters and all that is serious - who cares!) , Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah) is a loving father of Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude to the responsibilities of life. However, his love for Aditya delays him in procreation. However, faced with a situation that will test her time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house, hoping that the new situation will make him more aware of his own life. . But this presumed solution becomes a problem in itself, as the gap between father and son grows and barriers continue to grow. <br /> <br /> No need to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story offers many opportunities to infuse comedy and drama. So, before the interval, you have the initially amusing, then boring, comic title of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and after the interval, there is the turn for your scarf moments between Aby and Akki! The writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original play in Gujarati 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' on which the film is based) is very good at keeping the narrative thread. Dialogues tend to become sometimes inconsistent. It does not help that the songs appear like acne on a teenage face and ruin the procedure. Obviously, some numbers could have been deleted. At the management level, Vipul shows that he has a natural flair for telling stories. "Waqt", as well as his first essay "Aankhen", manage to interest you until the last turn. On a personal note, the rocking of emotions was a little jerky for me. But judging by the reactions of the public, he worked hard. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Waqt" comes down to his performances that represent a whole point in the overall score! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable, as always. His energy is visible and his age too! Shefali presents a finely nuanced performance and matches the superstar with every step. Boman and Rajpal arrive at home with their funny stories. Priyanka has nothing to do but to fulfill the superficial role of heroin. When everything comes down, Waqt is Akshay's vehicle. I have always maintained that Akki is as good as the role that suits him. Put him in a "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and he is fantastic, but in a "Bewafaa" he is terribly bad. Here, Akki is probably at his best. Be it his comic timing or his emotional rendering, he is almost perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his best performance was in Aankhen, with the same director and Big B at his side! <br /> <br /> "Waqt" is by no means a memorable movie. It's not the one that will feature in the best movies in our industry. But it's one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is desperate for universal success, 'Waqt' could do the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Trivia - This is Akshay Kumar's second consecutive film after 'Bewafaa', in which he plays on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Rating - *** <br /> <br /> * Mediocre ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
