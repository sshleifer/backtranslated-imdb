This film captivated my heart from the start, hearing Quincy Jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful purple color of flowers in the meadows. It's really a movie for which to cry and die ...! The whole cast gives the best performance in a movie I've seen for years and Spielberg really outdid himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh my God!), Danny Glover and the others all give us the best of themselves and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives him the insecurity and the feeling of inferiority that the character needs, and we grow with her, we grow strong with her, throughout the film, and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful in the role of Shug Avery, even when she is at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners", indeed, "also have a soul". Danny Glover, always friendly and charming, does a wonderful job making him hate, and the wonderful music of (I would say sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this beautiful movie! Photography, music, director and music make this beautiful and inspiring film an experience of life. You do not want to miss it! "Sista '... remember my name ..."
