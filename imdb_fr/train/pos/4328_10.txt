I bought the DVD of this version to compare it to the current version of the 2005 BBC (which is brilliant). The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy on television and who died this year (2005). I remember the great acting, especially Rigg and Elliott, and the moving music. (The music in the 2005 version is much more discreet, but very talking.) Just to draw the attention of commentators on some points: Richard Carstone is the boyfriend of Ada Claire, not that of Esther. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake has never played Krook in any of these versions, nor Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of the great novel of Dickens. Now read the book! It's not perfect and sentimentality can make you wince from time to time, but I challenge you not to cry - and laugh!
