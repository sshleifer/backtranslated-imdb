Overflowing with symbolism and filled with a wonderful cinematography, Ecstasy is more than the erotic drama we all expected. It's almost a silent film, with what dialogue it exists in German, and a very simplified German to that. Perhaps the filmmakers wanted the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with a high level of education, even the highest in the German language, can easily do without subtitles. In any case, the story is of little importance, as the film has succeeded at the cinematographic and non-narrative level. The symbols of fertility and the power of nature overwhelm human characters - there are even scenes where flowers darken the face of the supposed star Hedy Lamarr - and some moments will remind the audience of the works of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has a message to transmit, I think it is political: the bourgeois man is shy and helpless; the working class is a happy and productive creature; and the woman is the creator, destined not to be fulfilled until she gives birth to a child. This mix of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma does not in any way overwhelm the film - it's a beauty to look at from beginning to end - but it places it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yes, Hedy takes out his kit.
