Wow, I loved this movie. The latest Hollywood blockbusters may not have the funds or the advertising needed, but his emotions are twice as strong. The story revolves around this family from Utah. It is the links between the family members that make the movie feel good. The main role (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, he never lets you believe that he plays all his feelings. It was his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show. When they were together in scenes, they separated and gave fantastic performances. Super casting, super movie.
