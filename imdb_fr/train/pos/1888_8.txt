"If I wanted to dribble, I would call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "You do not have enough?" ... "More than enough." <br /> <br /> "You got me a choo-choo." <br /> <br /> "If I start dying, remove (the cowboy hat) from my head, that's not the way I want to be remembered." > <br /> Some of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotes from this charming and often insightful movie. Dudley Moore is charming, lovable and rich. Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving ... and poor. Both have a non-father / father-son relationship that defines the man Arthur must become. Will he follow his heart and his soul, or just his wealth? In twenty-five years, I returned to this film, with joy and amusement. It's a movie to come back to again and again, and remember what's important in life, no matter how short. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
