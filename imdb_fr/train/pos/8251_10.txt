And this someone is me. And not only me, as I can see it here at IMDb or coming out of the theater. Why did people like it? It's obvious: everyone knew the zombies already (at least the Horror fans by heart and the others thanks to the reinvention of "Dawn of the Dead" or the films Resident Evil, etc.) <br /> < Or at least, they thought they knew everything about zombies ... it's until this movie arrives. And you will see the zombies in a new light (maybe). It's not a horror movie, although it contains violent scenes, but rather a comedy. A satire to be precise. And he never runs out of steam! That's why I noted it so high. It's wise, it's amazing, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) error ... on the contrary: it's a jewel and if you're a little bit interested in zombies, you should to see him! And even if you do not like them, look at them! Because it's a great movie (comic)!
