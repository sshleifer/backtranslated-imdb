Big Joe Buck, virile but naive, leaves his home in Big Spring, Texas, and rushes to the Big Apple in search of women and a lot of money. In New York, JB is confronted with frustration and "Ratso" Rizzo, a rogue but at the same time disheveled but cordial. In one way or another, this mismatched couple manages to survive, which helps them both to face a city America, sometimes brutal and brutal, en route to a poignant end. <br /> <br /> At once funny and depressing, our "Midnight Cowboy" goes straight into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change and confirms to viewers in 1969 that they themselves have been swept away by innocence. from the 1950s and abandoned, like Dorothy and Toto, in the 1960s Aquarius. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is masterful; the casting is perfect; the acting is top; the script is clear and convincing; cinematography is engaging; and the music improves all the above. Rightly, he won the Oscar for best film of 1969, and I would vote it as one of the best films of this cyclonic decade.
