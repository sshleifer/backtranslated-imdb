A must for anyone who loves photography. beautiful and breathtaking, leaves you in the ore. seen twice once in a cinema and now on DVD. it fits well on DVD but on the big screen it was something else. <br /> <br /> It took my two daughters to see it and they loved it, my oldest cried at the end. But it was she who wanted to see him again tonight when she saw him at the video store. his simple story of a child's love for nature and especially a fox is well told. In some ways, he reminded me of the bear in his way of telling a nonformate documentary story. which works great for kids. it is very important not to be preached, you decide yourself. <br /> <br /> But the star of this film is the filmmakers, how did they do what they did. incredible just amazing.
