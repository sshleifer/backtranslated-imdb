Damn, damn it ... I stupidly procrastinated (not the right term, there is a long list!) To watch this movie and I finally had the chance to do it. And the "news" is: A wonderful labyrinthine show! <br /> <br /> For all the "followers" of Von Trier: Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in the dark, The five obstacles, etc ... Europa is probably the difference for its size in terms visuals. Everything is beautifully dark and claustrophobic! You really feel inside this nightmarish "imaginary" time chain. Taking up masters of surrealist cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, to the black films of the 40s with the acid drops of the avant-garde Von Trier leads the art film scene as a filmmaker "well-intentioned" nowadays . His authoritarian way of dealing with very complex problems, without being irrational, strikes the nerve of the viewer with the intention of healing some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. <br /> As utopian as it sounds, I think people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader sense. The day of films and filmmakers with this kind of power is no longer necessary, but perhaps the beginning of a new era: "The era of emotional control of our fears". This is what he constantly offers us in his work over and over again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
