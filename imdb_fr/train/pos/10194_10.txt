It would have worked much better if it had been made under the name of "Mitchell in Malta". At least we would have been spared at least the sight of Joe Don Baker running in a picturesque Mediterranean area wearing this ridiculous cowboy outfit ... not to mention playing like an Old West Gunslinger. Mitchell being Mitchell, the film would not have suffered from a lack of police brutality. Never mind. At least, Mike and the Bots' humorous comments made this nice rate an episode of MST. I can not imagine looking at him alone, though.
