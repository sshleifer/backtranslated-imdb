For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will certainly impress you, because of the quality of its adaptation. With the exception of a minor minor intrigue, Sturla Gunnarson's first feature film is an almost irreproachable re-creation of the book (to the last line). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie could be a little tricky. This is certainly not a great story of cinematic drama. Instead, it has a strong element of realism, but I would not want it to be otherwise. The best way to describe such a long trip to moviegoers would be to say that it is a small-scale Hindu version of "Fiddler On The Roof". Instead of a Jewish / Russian slag, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker from Bombay in the 1970s, at the time of the war between Pakistan and the Hindus. He is forced to face a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his eldest individual son, a distant friend who puts him involved in dirty money and an unhealthy neighborhood. The end is neither happy nor sad, but it is essentially what realism implies. <br /> <br /> Such a long trip is a good little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it has been published very little.
