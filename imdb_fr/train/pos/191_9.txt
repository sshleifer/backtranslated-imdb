Back in the day, if Marion Davies had her hard voice and not only listened to William Randolph Hearst, she would have shot more movies like Show People and would have been a lot happier. In fact, when you see her making her first big release in a two-reel comedy, she would have loved doing it in her career rather than epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> All you see in Show People is the real Davies, a talented comedian, a great imitator and a generous and generous person. She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper, aka Patricia Prepoire, she bore her share of pretension in her Hollywood celebrity. <br /> <br /> If the plot of Show People was in the legitimate phase you would call it is a behind-the-scenes story. I guess it's one of the first films on movies that you could call a story behind the camera. Marion is a young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others, in search of this great break. She wants to make drama, but her introduction to cinema is the aluminum comics burlesque. She takes her pie and seltzer in the face, but learns her craft. And also wins the heart of the young comic actor William Haines. <br /> <br /> She makes her first big outing, but this is not the case for Haines too and Marion has to make a legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli. , playing Andr√© Telfair, a pretend without Count Comte d'Avignon. Someone here was trying actor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others, and hearing about it, one of the most despised movie characters. <br /> <br /> Show People was one of the first films to have unbilled appearances of stars as such. You'll meet such personalities as Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc., while being themselves in and around the film's colony. That in itself makes Show People a movie that is worth saving. <br /> <br /> Show People also made good use of Tin Pan Alley's classic songs, such as, We do not have fun, I sit at the top of the world, You'd be surprised, California, I'm coming. As the film came out on the eve of the introduction of the sound, a song called Crossroads was introduced. This is not a bad figure, but no credit is given to the boy and girl who sing it in the soundtrack. I guess since they are not seen, it was felt that no billing was necessary. I would still like to know and I'm sure you would if you had the chance to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand why Marion Davies loved this film so much and considered it personal. prefer. She looks so comfortable in this film and her lack of real-life looks shines through in her performance, making it a real treat for the audience.
