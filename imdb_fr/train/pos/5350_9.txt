I've seen The Running Man many times because I'm a fan of Stephen King and I have all his movies, but now it's even better because until 2 days ago, I did not know this site and I did not realize Paul Michael Paul Michael Glaser, who grew up watching Starsky and Hutch, was involved in this movie. For me, it's a nice surprise, because I can not tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch were injured. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) nearly died, I cried so much that my father had to turn away from the show. What do you expect from a 12 year old? Now, I intentionally search for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul and all that Stephen King has in his hands, I'm so there !!!!!!!! I just said happy birthday Paul !!!!!
