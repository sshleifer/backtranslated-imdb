It was an excellent movie that had a lot of underlying issues. It dealt with issues of racism and class. But there was also a message to know each other and to take responsibility. This movie was very deep it gave the message that you and only you can control your destiny. She also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way to integrate into society. What others think about you is not important. I think this film did a great job in showing it. I think the actors were able to transmit each character wonderfully. I just thought it was amazing the depth of this movie. By simply looking, you will not see how deep the film is, but looking further, you see the underlined meaning of the film.
