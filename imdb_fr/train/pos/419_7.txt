This epic Cecil B. DeMille from the Old West contains what is perhaps the most beautiful representation of Jean Arthur: a hysterical, an eccentric, an incurable but devoutly devouring amorous, Calamity Jane. She really succeeded! Gary Cooper is at his most taciturn, but he sometimes resolves pithy words: "The plains are big, but the paths intersect ... sometimes." The story is a pastiche to put an end to all the pastiches. All cowboy heroes of Western tradition seem to be there, except Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story in person (or at least, DeMille would have us believe it). There is no room for something as evanescent as subtlety, it's a tale of madness for the masses. What is remarkable about this film is that it is an early frontal attack on what Eisenhower finally called "the military-industrial complex". It's not just a story of gunmen, but arming anyone for money, right from the heart of Washington. But do not go into politics, leave it to DeMille, who can be sure of being superficial. The main interest of this film, all those years later, is that it uses the first score composed by George Antheil, who has a lot to say about the work of his autobiography, "Bad Boy of Music". Antheil seems to be at the origin of the "big sound" adopted by all subsequent Westerns, the plains singing with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating the wide open spaces and imbricating common melodies. That's why it does not seem unusual at all, because we've heard it a thousand times. But he seems to have been the first to summon the combined rustling of all sage brushes in this open sky symphony that has entered the mythical American tradition and given it a soundtrack that has never changed since then. to be, but probably appropriate. It's fun to see Anthony Quinn appear early as an Indian Cheyenne. Gabby Hayes is somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. Gary Cooper overtakes them all, but when did he ever seem small?
