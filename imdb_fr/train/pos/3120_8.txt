Paul Greengrass has definitely saved the best Bourne for the end! I've heard a lot of people complain about the way he filmed this movie, and some even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch project. All I have to say is that ... you do not care about me? Go it was not so bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to be more realistic, which I would prefer to a very stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I did not even notice it. <br /> <br /> You can see that Damon really got used to Jason Bourne's role. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it's a very good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this episode. Damon also has very good actors in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the CIA's secret organization. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is full of car chases and incessant actions, they have been able to stick enough of the character development in theirs with everything going on. This film is well above the other two Bourne movies and is certainly one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!
