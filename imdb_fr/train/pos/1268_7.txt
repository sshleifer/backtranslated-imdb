Just Cause picks up some of the best parts of three movies, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and The Silence of the Lambs, and mixes them to create a quality thriller. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to former Deputy Attorney Kate Capshaw and a Crusader Against Capital Punishment. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee buttoned Connery at a conference and persuaded him to handle his grandson's call. He is on death row for the murder of a young girl. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural area of ​​Florida, he comes up against a sheriff's tough singer played by Laurence Fishburne, as ruthless in his crime solving as Orson Welles. was in contact with the evil. <br /> <br /> Later, when Connery canceled the verdict with evidence he discovered, he feels pretty good about himself. At this point, the film takes a decisive turn from the touch of evil at Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that everything is not what it seems is a euphemism. The distribution runs regularly in good performances. A special mention must be made to Ed Harris who plays Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer sentenced to death with Underwood. He's going to make your skin crawl and he's starting to get Connery to rethink some of those Liberal premises on which he bases his beliefs. Many of the confirmed Liberals I know have come out of criminal thinking once they become victims of crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, the opposite is just as true. Many law and order conservatives who get involved on the wrong side of the criminal justice system want to ensure that all their rights are guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and an endless process for all of society. I guess if Just Cause has a morality, that would probably be it.
