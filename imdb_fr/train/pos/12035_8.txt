I recently came across this movie on TNT five minutes later, while I was going on vacation to Florida ... (there must be some free time at the hotel, right?) Movie about TNT. I mean "Drive Me Crazy" is not that old, is it? <br /> <br /> But I stayed with that, and I was completely surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her role of Jennifer psychotic excellently. Supportive actors (Nick, the ex-boyfriend, his best friend Karen, and his parents who control life) all added credibility. The twist at the end was a nice conclusion to this story of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance, take a look! <br /> <br />
