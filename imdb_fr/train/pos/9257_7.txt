Is this your typical love story of women in the navy's transport chains? Maybe, God, you know how the formula works now, a pretty woman is introduced into an image, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think this movie follows typical stories, but it does not say anything about the content. There are big scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, though short. Some things did not make sense, like the need to participate in random fights, but it's fun, but the fighting was well done. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy above all, but has a lot of good feelings. The humor is well balanced, you will not hurt your stomach, but you will keep smiling. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of hot action, so not for kids.
