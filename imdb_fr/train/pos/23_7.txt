Okay, the music was poorly written and generally badly sung (although Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sound pretty good). And so they broke the fourth wall at the end by letting the king and his nobles sing about the "battle" with the ogre, and praise the efforts of Puss in Boots when they should not have even known it, from full right. /> <br /> Who cares? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, who makes a film based on a fairy tale, who sings and dances. His acting plays very well with the role of the sneaky and evil kitty cat, which seems to plunge his master into deeper and deeper trouble, but he actually has a plan that he has thought of seven or eight shots at a time. 'advanced. And if you've ever seen Walken in one of his naughty roles, you * know * that the ogre stung the dust in the end when Walken put him in his trap. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, and a must-have for anyone who loves Christopher Walken's unique style.
