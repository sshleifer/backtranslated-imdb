A well-made and imaginative production, refreshing without clich√©, this somewhat picaresque affair tells the story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy in less than ideal conditions: the man, a convicted fugitive who kidnapped the young value as a hostage. Expertly directed by Alan Gibson with a keen sense of balanced narrative movement, the film brings freshness in almost every scene, while criminal Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), finding his rejection of parole was particularly unjustified , is a complicated but ultimately successful escape plan. as a result of which his spontaneous nature appears as he fled to the lakeside residence of his childhood. Steckert, capricious, often gains the confidence and affection of his prisoner and, as the police approach an inevitable confrontation, the paired pair sees themselves as very similar in their responses to the forms of rejection, according to the indications of a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) to help a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn) in charge of the manhunt for Steckert and his "prisoner". It's a captivating story, worth telling, a new, rhythmic adventure that takes advantage of a stellar performance by Harris, Wagner, Coburn, and Karen Black, as well as Justin Henry as a boy pulled off, with a whimsical score. a contribution by Wilfred Josephs and a world-class cinematography by Frank Watts, all images being shot in a beautiful autumn Ontario province.
