Of course, the story of this film was "Hollywoodized" - but it's far from the only piece of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte sided with the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, and not because of any sense of patriotism for a country that had seized New Orleans there was not much time; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused his departure for Galveston; he was more a little criminal and a scoundrel than a hero or a braggart. But who cares? It's a pure entertainment movie - and, in fact, we all wanted John to go for the feigned sword rather than the governor's prude girl. Brynner stands up again on a mediocre handwriting to give a fascinating performance.
