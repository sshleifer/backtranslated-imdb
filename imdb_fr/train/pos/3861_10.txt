2 words: Academy Award. Said Nuff. This film had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, drama to make me cry and one of the biggest dance scenes to compete with Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The acting game was the pinnacle of any independent film. Jeremy Earl had been in good form for a long time since his stint at the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with dynamite precision and sharp wit, last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I had witnessed the emergence of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My bus !! She left" left. It was the real turning point of the film. My grandmother liked the DVD so much that I bought her and recommend it to her friends. This will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart when you see the Tony Donato white tie and the African-American Nathan Davis tie. Through the thick (being held at the end of the knife) and slim (Nathan giving Tony advice on women), the dynamic new duo has arrived and is ready to conquer Hollywood.
