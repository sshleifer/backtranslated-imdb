The low-budget Brit Pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, gets it and finds it a little too much. A good distribution and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have all been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice is very much like Mini Mouse! She disappeared from view shortly after shooting this film - so that life could imitate art! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born.
