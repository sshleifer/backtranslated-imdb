District Attorney George Maxwell, a frustrated middle-aged man (a good performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this image), can not stand his perverted and icy wife Edith (Anne Bellamy) . Worse still, poor George is still afflicted with a newborn sun and a lascivious lesbian teenager (the gorgeous brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous adventure with the charming swinging and attractive hippie babysitter and free spirit Candy Wilson (exquisitely played with sexy aplomb by the lovely blonde KO, Patricia Wymer). Complications ensue when George Freer (a nicely venomous turn of Kathy Williams) makes George sing, who wants George to bring out his psychotic boyfriend Laurence Mackey (a scary Robert Tessier, who wears a head full of hair here) from prison . Director Tom Laughlin (yes, the same guy who played Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLarty cover sumptuous history with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity, hot sex and raw violence. In addition, they accurately assimilate the wild and uninhibited sensitivity of the youth culture of the 60s and relate the plot in a tight scenario of 75 minutes, ensuring that this film does not exceed its reception. A highlight comes when Candy invites her groovy friends to visit the Maxwells for an improvised basement party, smoking marijuana, lousy rock music and, of course, hot dancing and nude girls . Robert O. Ragland's great score hits the spot. Stanton Fox's black and white cinematography adds a touch of extra granularity to the delusional. Best of all, this movie is a great showcase for Patricia Wymer, charming and fresh, who illuminates the screen with her sweet and sparkling beauty and captivating beauty. A total treat trash.
