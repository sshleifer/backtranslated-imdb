To a friend who is currently forming a relationship with an SOB who has a long-time girlfriend. Of course, the SOB is very beautiful, charming, etc. and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching the character of Jean-Pierre Leaud at work is like watching what happens in real life when men like that destroy the lives of our friends. It's tragic, and you know she's going to be very hurt, but you can not do anything. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty. All in white, he draws the faces and tells the stories that he thinks will spark the reaction he wants. <br /> <br /> The scene takes place in the two hours where Leaud and Lebrun made love and the next morning record and, very kindly and charming, sings to amuse him is brilliant. The expression "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" that wobbles on his face will remain long in my memory. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but see it all at once, preferably in a movie theater. It takes a while to get in, but then the time disappears.
