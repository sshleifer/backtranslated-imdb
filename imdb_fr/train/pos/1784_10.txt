Evening is an entertaining film with a certain depth. All actors and actresses achieve spectacular performances. However, with an impressive cast, we expect a stellar actor, but in this film, expectations are exceeded. One can relate to personalities and situations in one's own family. When we observe the interaction of family members, the memories of the family are immediately evoked. This is one of the few films that encourages reading the book. Usually, it's the opposite. we read the book and then want to see the film. I will definitely get a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. The landscape of Rhode Island is spectacular, as is the soundtrack. Every car enthusiast will appreciate vintage cars that have been carefully restored. Needless to say now, but I highly recommend Le Soir. See, you will appreciate it.
