I almost did not go to see this film because I remember that the walking of the penguin was not very exciting. I went there mainly because Disney had promised to plant a tree if I saw it on the opening weekend, but once I went to see it, it was just amazing. the fact that photographers can capture impossible images is simply worth your money. You will also have the opportunity to see different habitats, different types of vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will shock you - simply because you will never think that nature is so magical and dynamic - but you also touch your soul and raise the question of humanity in relation to others. the way our lives have deviated from nature to such an extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and miracles that are essential to our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of the Earth or an environmentalist who loves trees to appreciate the impressive nature of this documentary. You must simply be a curious soul who questions the value and the miracle of life. Enjoy!
