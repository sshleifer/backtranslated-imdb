I love this show as an action packed with adventure, love and intrigue. Well, sometimes, love! It's so good to see a show where all the characters work well together and treat each other with respect. It's also great to see Dick Van Dyke play on television because I only saw it in Mary Poppins. The mix of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is very captivating for the audience. It's a show you have to watch!
