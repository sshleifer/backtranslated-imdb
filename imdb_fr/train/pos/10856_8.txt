British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: silent, introspective, generally romantic study and ridiculous social satire. Parameters, characters, and concepts vary, but some features place the vast majority of programs in one of two categories. Butterflies may be the epitome of the first type. <br /> <br /> The texts are very verbal, including long interior monologues of the main character Ria, a housewife fundamentally happy but worried, curious to know what could have escaped her when she was launched into a completely conventional life. When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally approachable businessman (who gives her all his interest for her), she plays with the idea of ​​discovering what the other way could have offered. <br /> <br /> The scenario and scenarios are always about money, so the reaction to the show is almost entirely personal: I was not blown away or turned off. My mother, on the other hand, loved this show. I think that the degree to which one identifies with Ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's response to butterflies.
