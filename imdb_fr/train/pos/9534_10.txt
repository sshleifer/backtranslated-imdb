Acting This film is a very well played movie. I will say that the performances are sometimes a bit weak; but overall, the acting is very good. The only actor who has blown me away with his performance is Jude Law in the role of Harlen Maguire. He was amazing! Tom Hanks seemed a little uncertain at times throughout the film, but he was also amazing. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography That's what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall is a real genius. If, at any point in the film, you had to suspend it, you will see the finely worked work of this man. He organizes every shot so nothing is left. When the camera is still, there is a postcard quality on the screen. As the camera moves, each shot is planned to perfection. But it does not stop there. The choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he illuminates the whole is part of the most amazing lighting work I have ever seen. His work on this film did what he is. This film is at the top of the list of best cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Heroes, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. History People will say that this movie is a 1930s gangster movie, but I think they missed the film's purpose. This is a love story telling the story of a hit-man who fails to protect his son from the life he has chosen. It's a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds in a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other. Screenwriting is worthy of an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but optimistic score to intensify this sad but optimistic story. The music is one of the most beautiful and touching scores I've had. Management Sam Mendes is a new director with the feeling of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors are rare in the current cinematographic world. I'll be on the lookout for Sam Mendes's next movie. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful films I have ever seen.
