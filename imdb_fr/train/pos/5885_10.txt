This film surprised me enough. I did not have high expectations for that, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written. They did not spend too much time digging into the past, so they did not rely on the success of the old TV show to make the film. Overall, it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit-com and I think I could agree with her.
