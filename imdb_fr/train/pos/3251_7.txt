Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", the remake of "Yojimbo" Kurosawa by Sergio Leone (suggested by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This one is strictly a film B; taken like that, it's rather nice. the staging is clear, the game full of verve, the limitations of his photography "direct on video" well managed. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film lies in the disastrous decision to marry the "fist" / "yojimbo" plot in a subplot of Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West". Although Leone realized both "Fistful" and "West", her motives behind the two films could not be different. "The nameless man" (Eastwood) is a borderline social-social path with a soft spot for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with her own broken family and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have had much to do with each other. To reunite them, "Gun Crazy" must twist his plot and complicate it until we lose the thread of the story we follow. <br /> <br /> But it's a B movie after all, filled with action and foolishness; it's entertaining at this level, but do not wait.
