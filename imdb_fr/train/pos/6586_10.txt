Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes to date, on the verge of the great Basil Rathbone of course, and this is probably the best adaptation of a Conon-Doyle short story. <br /> <br /> A length adaptation includes new elements that corresponds well to the drama that surrounds it and accentuates the hate one feels for Milverton. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances, particularly of Robert Hardy, as well as Brett and Hardwick perfectly rounded and comfortable in their roles make it a superb piece of drama.
