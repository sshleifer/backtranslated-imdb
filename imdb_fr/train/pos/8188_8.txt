I really enjoyed the first part of this block, The Impossible Planet, and I was a little afraid that the second is not as effective as in the past of the two partners in the series 2 Who. But luckily, my fears were unfounded because I found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. Anyway, we start with the surviving crew members who leave the Ood and become the devil's pawn. There is also a little philosophizing from the Doctor in the episode that I liked. Needless to say, it was a good story about Doctor Who. This could be a little too intense for the youngest viewers. <br /> <br /> My note: B +
