Netflix should mention this short feature in the Silk Stockings info. Superior in all directions to this down on-product. It had been much better to sing Cole Porter and a lot more energy. Silk Stockings turned out to be a big disappointment. Fred was getting too old for that kind of thing, even though the dances and Cyd are adorable. I will watch the Ninochka version of Garbo - Melvyn Douglas. Was Peter Lorre sick when making Silk Stockings - he seems to be very passive in the most active numbers and with fewer lines? Very happy to have crossed Paree - Paree by pure accident. Made the experience a lot more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple "singer and dancer" is pure joy.
