From the Austen film series of the 1990s, it is my favorite, even more than "Persuasion", which converted me to Austeniana. Before seeing this "Emma", I had seen two previous versions, but one of them seemed quite wrong, rather that of Lady Teazle and, in the other, it seemed half wrong, the way of a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed fair, young and ridiculous. and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and the atmosphere of the production translated the charm of the novel extremely well; in fact, it's one of the sweetest and happiest things I've ever seen, more like a Christmas treat. The script is unusually well-formed, and the additions to the adapter, like the ray of light that reveals Harriet to Emma in the church, are all in good condition. Mark Strong is not what I expected from Knightley, but I like him a lot: he brings out with strength the vulgar and practical side of the character, which contrasts with Emma's assignments and her angry crises against Frank Churchill are fun enough. . Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton, as Emma's protégé, is as sweet and firm as she should be. And as in "Pride and Prejudice" of the same producers, it is ensured that the possible couplings of characters can be believed - only in certain cases. For me, this production has been and remains a delight.
