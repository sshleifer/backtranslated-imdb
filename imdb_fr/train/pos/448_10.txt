I think this film is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just talking about the breathtaking landscape. It is about two unfortunate English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their less happy family life. In the end, four women together praise the place together, each with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this beautiful place magically, they all find the peace they dream of and, interestingly, this peace comes from reflections and inner resolutions, more than without. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed on kindness and understanding. The acting is a joy to look at in oneself. I particularly like the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
