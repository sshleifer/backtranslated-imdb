I was watching this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I was talking with my mother-in-law at the same time). Can anyone tell me what happened to him? I slightly observed that her husband heard someone talking to his wife in the bedroom, then he opened the door, she is already dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to him? Did she kill herself? How was she able to organize just like phone calls when she was at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer? Anyone can explain to me, please. I am so so curious !! (In the end, I read that she was suffering from the personality of the multiplication disorder). <br /> <br /> Thnks before.
