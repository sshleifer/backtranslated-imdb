It was originally a film in which Gene Kelly would play, but when the producers could not find it, they got the "best actor in the world" and the result is pretty good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is struggling to do what he does best, to set up a dice game with big stakes, because he needs $ 1000 to have room. So, to get the money he needs, he bet $ 1000 with his old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can not convince Sergeant Sarah Brown (Great Expectations Golden Globe winner, and Jean Simmons Havana Meanwhile, Nathan is struggling to get rid of the woman who wants to ask him to get married, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also featured Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley as Big Jule. An interesting romantic musical, where Brando sings all her songs and where Sinatra is sweet and cool. He has been nominated for Oscars for Best Artistic Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge. He has also been nominated at BAFTA for the best film, regardless of its source. Best movie - musical / comedy.
