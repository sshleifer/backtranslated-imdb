This is one of Jodie Foster's best films and is largely ignored because of the public's misconception of viewing it as a teen movie. It has great performances, including a fight scene between Jodie and his mother, performed by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodie's friends are a bit amateurish, but I think it's worth a visit.
