Brendan Filone is the absolute best character of the Sopranos. he died while being shot in the eye. It was the best and well orchestrated stage of all time in the Sopranos. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Filone will haunt Uncle Junior in his dreams until Uncle Junior can do more. Brendan Filone is the best character. Brendan Filone was killed in episode 3, denial, anger and acceptance. But his legacy will live forever. Brendan Filone is the best character on Sopranos! Brendan Filone is the best character of all time. I recommend this series to all those who love Drama and wish to see good scenes of death, a good staging and good production, because nothing is better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
