It may (or may not) be considered interesting that the only reason I really watched this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his film CASABLANCA ( 10/10) Best actor Oscar (I would still have given the Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a great job and deserved at least the nomination.) Well, I'm glad I watched this movie because I enjoyed it immensely. I think the movie preaches a bit, but not only did it not bother me, I enjoyed the speeches and never tired of it. <br /> <br /> The action was exceptional in this film. I especially liked Paul Lukas Lucile Watson (rightly named for an Oscar), Bette Davis (unduly proposed), George Coulouris and, curiously, Eric Roberts, who plays the role of the child in the middle. I really enjoyed his character: a weird boy who speaks like a kind of philosopher. He just made me crack. Even the name of the character (Bodo) is fun. <br /> <br /> g, in which Lukas's character was forced to do something he did not see well, even if he did it for all the right reasons, also worked for me. I agree with the reasons why he thinks he did this and I understood why he could not explain everything. The message of this film is good and noble, the landscape (that is to say the house) is beautiful and the acting is excellent. Watch this movie if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> 9/10
