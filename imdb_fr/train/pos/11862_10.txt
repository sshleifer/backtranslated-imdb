did not anyone who played games here notice that the movie GTA: Vice City Mansion and other elements, including the weapons of the film, are related to the film and that this film inspired the designers of the film? game (Rockstar Games) to copy some things from this film and elsewhere, this is one of the best movies of the 80s, I recommend it to all those who have not yet seen 10/10 without posing Questions
