I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese movies like these are never broadcast in prime time. I must say that this is one of the best serious movies of all time, which highlights the difference between Hong Kong and Chinese mainland. This really shows that there is a discomfort between the two, but it can only improve as HK learns Mandarin. It also showed me how the indie rock scene exists in mainland China and that the Chinese know how to scratch the guitar and make house funking! Who said China was not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with his crisp and clear voice, his honest acting and his total magnet. I recommend this film to those who do not know much about Asian people to purify themselves of typical Western stereotypes, and those who just like Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Check it out!
