We have just seen the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - a perfect treat - cleverly done, touching, fun, dramatic and meaningful. I could not agree more. I only hope that the rest of the Festival's films will reach this level of entertainment and I hope to see more Chinese films screened in Sydney in the coming months.
