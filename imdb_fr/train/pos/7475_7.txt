After reading quite negative points about this movie, I was not sure I had to spend money to rent it. However, it was a nice surprise. I did not see the original movie, but if it was better than that, I would be in paradise. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as David, seemingly unstable, convincing me that he is more than a smile on his legs (for the third time only of his career - the other examples were Magnolia and born on July 4th). Penelope Cruz is slightly light but fulfills the requirements of her role, just like Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. However, in the film, it is not the acting game that really impresses, but the cinema. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe excels as the director, offering a welcome change of pace from his usual style. The growing madness of the film is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence where Cruise travels through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinctive feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a spectator. The plot seems a little artificial, but the problems explored are questionable to infinity. The film is not perfect, but it's a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those who grew up under a Hollywood diet, it should be a revelation.
