A warm and touching film of fantastic quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is, as always, superb. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given many outstanding performances, but Something about it will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> Especially, you must see this amazing 5 years. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by his presence that I had to buy the film so I could watch it again and again. She is a miracle of the creation of God. <br /> <br /> Judging by the IMDB rating, I'm not the only one to be fascinated by this young actress.
