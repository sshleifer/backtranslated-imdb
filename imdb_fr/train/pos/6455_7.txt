I was attracted by this film as soon as I saw a preview on Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I became hooked. We Americans are aspirants for a child back. <br /> <br /> I understand that this film was a huge draw in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only speculate on reason. It may be because of the provocative joke that Lena's character makes at the beginning of the film and other social commentaries, but maybe it's because of the central message that, in my opinion, has the same attractive everywhere in rich societies. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is the same as that of the movie Titanic. Life is short and as far as anyone knows, that's all we have. It can be removed at any time. So, is not it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls that separate us from others because we are so afraid of being hurt? Breaking down the walls is painful, but feeling alive lives on the other side of these miserable walls. Feeling alive is worth taking chances. Give and you will receive. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this film for its lack of characterization and other flaws. I say that you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Talk about it, it is a parable, a fable for us, the wealthy Westerners, rich in material terms, but whose souls are in abject poverty. <br /> <br /> Join a choir or a group, help build homes or give food to those who are less fortunate than you. Spread joy and make the world a better place as long as you go out and communicate with your neighbor. Making a check is not enough. By the way, we are a social species. Even the most humble of your fellows can touch you in ways you never thought possible. <br /> <br /> Robust individualism has its place, but it is overrated.
