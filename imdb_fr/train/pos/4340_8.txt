I enjoyed this film, maybe because I did not see any critics, etc. It was delicious and a little "amazed". I do not know why it did not make more noise than it did. Regarding the story, I could relate some aspects of Paul Reiser's character and "see my father" in the character of Falk. It reminded me a lot of my time as a child and that I also listened to my grandparents. If you liked movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. A "sleeper", in my opinion, and one of those stories of well-being. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had a lot of wonderful word struggles, but nothing was exaggerated. I would say it is at least 8, maybe higher.
