I had just lived the worst day of my life. Then I came across this cute movie, I watched it and now I'm ready to go out and kiss a floor lamp. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I only looked at it for two reasons: VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. But it's really a lot more. The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its delicious misunderstandings. And of course, there is also ... THE VERA-ELLEN LEGS. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I bought (the 100 Family Classics collection from Mill Creek Entertainment) has the best video quality, and I heard the same thing about the Alpha version. The brightness and contrast are a little too strong, so many scenes seem discolored, especially when Vera dances in a white dress. But I guess you can manipulate the controls on your TV to compensate. I can only imagine its appearance on the big screen in 1951. The decorations, the costumes and the colors are also dazzling and deliciously scary - somehow in the sense of "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet". <br /> <br /> When it comes to romance, it's just perfect. Not sappy, not artificial, not melodramatic. Just 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, poor shit, your miserable lives will never be so charming. Har Har Har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life is zero like yours. Oh hell. It's time to watch this movie again.
