It looked like the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare planned for George Orwell's science fiction novel !! The year 1984 was one of the happiest in American history! The recovery of the economy and the reappearance of fundamental American values ​​have created an idealistic aura of innocence that has been perceived by the American people with a very favorable disposition. There have been many ersatz interpretations of classic films in the past, but the originals are almost always considered superior !! "Purple Rain" is a movie in this category !! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a doggerel of the eighties, a music of carefree quality, that they integrated in the realization of this excellent film !! Some artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics! Screwball comedies, neon accent clothing and, of course, music !! 80s music is considered by experts as the best decade for music in American history !! Located in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" allowed the use of naive entertainment as the city evolved. When I was little, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months. At the time, the non-white population was less than 3% !! By 1984, African Americans had built roads leading to Minneapolis and, as a result, they also created their own deeply rooted culture !! The film "Purple Rain" evokes clothes and a set of music of the 80s, which captivated effortlessly the audience of the film! I loved the music of "Purple Rain", and the innovative approach taken by this film against the conflictual success is indeed brilliant !! See this movie if you have not seen it yet !! Prince became an icon of the eighties with this masterpiece! For a short time, he went out with Kim Bassinger, he has to do something good !! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map !! This film gets my categorical verdict of THUMBS UP !!!!
