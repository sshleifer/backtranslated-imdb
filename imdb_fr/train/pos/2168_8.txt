A few years ago, I saw this film on television late at night, but it was an inconvenient experience that has remained to me until today. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a little unoriginal - because of an earthquake, an underground reserve containing a toxic nerve agent is pierced in the hills above a small town , and a microscopic amount of this substance reaches their food reserves. The city's inhabitants are beginning to lose their ability to be restrained by all the whims and light aspirations that run through our minds from time to time and normally know that we simply do not have to act. <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly, but for me it only added to the growing discomfort as the behavior of city-dwellers slowly began to crumble. Several surreal and very disturbing scenes have remained etched in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> This raises interesting questions about what we could all be able to do if we give in to our fiercest instincts. Did I enjoy? I'm not sure that "enjoy" is the right word. Did it make me think? Absolutely. I still think about it. Scary things.
