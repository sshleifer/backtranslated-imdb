Get ready: it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I am relatively unfamiliar with the other works of David Mamet (screenwriter and director), but after watching this film half a dozen times (it's always a pleasure to watch), I can say without hesitation that it is a genius. This film is extremely well written and plunges you quickly into its environment of deception, craft and backroom. The sensation of the film is very similar to that of The Sting (1973) and also pays tribute to the film noir. <br /> <br /> This is a psychologically complex film that will certainly make you think about the various twists and motivations of the plot. shady characters. It's a bit predictable sometimes but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Generally, the acting is superb, especially Joe Mantegna, but a person with whom I watched the movie pointed out to me that it was not a good idea. to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not only a gambler, a smoker and a thief, but who also wears a bad 80s hairstyle. I agree, but I think she is nevertheless remarkable in the role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this film, the better, like Mamet's latest film, The Spanish Prisoner, because the end will be even more impressive. Sit down and get ready to get caught up in a movie that is dangerously close to shine.
