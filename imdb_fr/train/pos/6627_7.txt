A dark scanner, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow ?? If you're a fan of these movies, then it'll be worth it. <br /> <br /> It took seven years for the French animation project "Renaissance" for a limited budget, and tonight I was able to see it at a private screening for the Stockholm International Film Festival . My spontaneous reaction is impressive. my next thought is "eh, neat" and further analysis unfortunately gets a resounding "meh". It's a great triumph of science fiction on the surface, but scratch it or poke it a bit and its intricately intricate plot becomes blatant, just like the flat characters. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is clear that the people at Onyx Films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface. The visuals are amazing. They used live action motion capture embedded in keyframe animation, with striking contrasts of jet black and brilliant white and a heavily shaded rotoscopic background. For those of you who are not with "technical jargon", the movie looks like a fully animated Sin City. Its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized jig is completed by a large dizzying flash. It's a vision. However, the clear sound effects that take the form of futuristic legendary weapons, suspenseful music, large drops of rain and splinters of glass also break all the merit. This is the wet dream of any techno-nerd ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a dark, dark and dark Paris, in which a big company called "Avalon" started to mingle with the lives of citizens under surveillance (consider the fluid and transparent screens of Minority Report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of the young researcher Ilona (expressed by the charming Romola Garai). Cut to Karas (Daniel Craig), our protagonist and policeman with hard shell ?? a man who makes the law in his hands ?? who is assigned the case to find and recover Ilona. During this affair, he is assisted by Illona's sister, with whom he also begins a love story. A very fragmented love story, if I may. <br /> <br /> The world of the Renaissance is remarkable. Director Christian Volckman is very interested in the fusion of black themes. The result is an urban jungle populated by bloodlines, rats, femme fatales and solitary detectives hiding in the shadows of the slums. The problem is that the creators have undoubtedly felt the need to have archetypes extremely clear and explicit in the story, otherwise the film would have been "too surreal" for the general public, because of its format of ominous animation. It follows that we have a multitude of clich√© characters such as villains with perverse laughs, shabby crime bosses and tough guys who push the smoke at every opportunity. It puts black in our faces, and it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the dialogue is a bit artificial. It seems that every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot. This is not fatal because the plot is so complex that once it sets in, you need a clear direction. Daniel Craig also helps here by bringing an impeccable attitude to his tough cop character. At one point in the Renaissance, he is seen in a car chase that is surely one of the most exciting sequences of the film. Unfortunately, the novelty of science-fiction visuals dissipated after this car chase and "Renassaince" could be slightly shorter. In summary, a futuristic comic book experience very interesting but imperfect. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
