Over Her Dead Body was a pretty little movie. It was decent and entertaining, while still quite funny. There were some clich√©s, but I found most of the cool things. At first I did not think it was going to be good If you can go beyond the first 20 minutes, the movie begins to become more and more interesting. This movie did not laugh hilariously, and oh was not wonderful, it was just a movie you can sit and enjoy the way it was nice.I do not see how this movie was bad The odds are a little too low. I could have dealt with a 5.5, but a 4.8? a 1 is shameful. He was good enough and there was nothing horrible about it to give him a 1, that's what most people gave him.
