This film was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained beautiful scenery and scenery. 2) He showed the disparity of a war-torn environment and a technological environment. 3) John Cusack's game was awesome. He described the anxiety very well. 4) He showed the vulnerabilities of each in a situation torn apart by the war. 5) This gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many ways. I was also impressed by the acting. Hilary's acting game was, I found, the most overwater. Morals and values ​​of everyone in a situation torn apart by war are to be won. The liberal journalist and the conservative businessman are able to do anything in any situation and are also unpredictable. Great thing. PSP
