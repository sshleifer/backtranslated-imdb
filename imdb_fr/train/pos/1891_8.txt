When you see this film, you begin to understand how much the late Dudley Moore was a considerably underutilized property. There should be a dozen films like this one in our archives. <br /> <br /> He was already a remarkable talent before going to Hollywood, both as a comedian and a musician. But it is remembered especially for his association with Peter Cook, on television and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was "dazzled". <br /> <br /> He has always tended to be eclipsed by Cook, who was jealous and mean, divided their partnership and allowed Moore to realize his true potential in America. "Arthur" is the result. <br /> <br /> It's a really beautiful movie. Moore's drunken clown comedy is undeniable. The script is perfectly suited in its own way with many hilarious, almost surreal conversational digressions. He has something so British about him that I'm surprised he found such appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian in the same way, tended to draw a blank. It is Moore's almost childlike vulnerability that is so endearing. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play heterosexual roles against him, while maintaining excellent doubles. John Guilgud, in particular, presents his with a sarcastic and bitter authority, a treasure to look at. He invariably steals any scene in which he appears and deserves his Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he never played another comic role. <br /> <br /> There is a following movie called "Arthur 2 - On The Rocks". It never reaches the same level of sublime fun as this one, but still pretty good. Guilgud only has a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost. It's darker. And there is an interesting plot. It will be disappointing if you look at "Arthur" first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to lose interest in Dudley after both of these outings. He eventually returned to Britain, shot and apparently dying. <br /> <br /> But 'Arthur' is a sample of what could have been. We can only imagine the other great movies he should have done. <br /> <br /> We missed you a lot, Dudley.
