I'm proud to say that I own an uncut copy of this piece of Crown International Sex-Productive Drive-In 70's sex-drive comedy cheese. It's a really awkward movie with a meaningless feel, with a pleasantly breezy'n'easy atmosphere. He tries to make a sincere point about the fact that true love and friendship are more important in life than cold wheels and a fast tail. Of course, it is essentially a blatant male fantasy - the main character of adolescence, Bobby Hamilton, gets the respect of the girls, the respect of his friends and the possibility of showing a local pickup truck - but this is too good mood to hate. Stuart Getz and our cheeky protagonist head for a charming face, Deborah White as the main object of Getz's affection is a well-defined darling, Connie Lisa Marie is also quite succulent as a beautiful blonde and makes fun of Neanderthal Stephan beef cake Oliver (a biker of 60 perennial film) is wonderfully hateful like the brutal Dugan Hicks. Danny DeVito, a pre-star in particular, is a real riot like Andy, the boss of the owner of Getz's grumpy car wash, an adorably pretentious swagger who wears some very ugly Hawaiian shirts and is very good at gambling. the scene where two thugs brutally beat Danny - one holds his arms behind his back while the other works on Danny's chest! And the catchy and catchy Sammy Johns theme song will resonate on your skull for at least a week. In short, it's a super fun groovy retro-70!
