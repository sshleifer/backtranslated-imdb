Charming does not even begin to describe "Saving Grace;" it's absolutely irresistible! All who venture into this film will leave with the haughty spirit. <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) just lost her husband, but her problems will get worse. Her dear deceased left her without money and without debt. Faced with losing everything, she must find a way to make a lot of money ... fast! She has an idea when her gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson), asks the city's renowned horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he secretly cultivates. Grace immediately realizes that her plant is marijuana. They then decide to use their gardening skills to grow a lot of high quality weeds and then sell them to pay their outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> The most outstanding quality on "Saving Grace" is his sympathy. All the characters are extremely friendly and, with the exception of the first 20 minutes or so, the film is a nonstop gay. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means turning a blind eye to rather illegal activities. <br /> <br /> The acting game is excellent. Brenda Blethyn is one of the best British actresses and here's why. It transforms what could have been a caricature into a fully alive and breathing individual. She's a nice lady, but she's not stupid. Craig Ferguson is just as kind as Matthew. He's a foolish loser, but he's so nice that it does not matter. The rest of the distribution also belongs to this category, but a special mention must be attributed to Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has an aura of threat around him, which suits him well, but he also has excellent acting qualities. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the ideal tone for "Saving Grace". It's all about charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy seems to be exhausted from the movie. Not so here. The film is very nice and always fun. That does not mean that "Saving Grace" is just a nice movie that will leave you with a smile and a nice feeling. Although this film is not a comedy, it presents two or three hysterical scenes. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of this film is that the climax is a little confusing. The questions are answered, however, and the end of the message has an unexpected twist. <br /> <br /> See "Save Grace", especially when you have a bad day.
