Most horror movies are actually horrible movies. They happen to be the same, the same. Mingle every minute with cheap thrills (usually "splashing") and nowadays, they can take away every second with high quality special effects. One of the goals of a very good horror movie is to suspend the public's sense of disbelief. For example, I saw the last two Mummy movies and I was almost dizzy to see ridiculous special effects by the second. The making of these movies probably costs a million dollars a second and my sense of disbelief was never suspended, it took root. <br /> <br /> The subtlety can be even more terrifying. Less is more. <br /> <br /> I saw for the first time "The woman in black" on the A & E channel. After going through the 987 usual channels of the very bad television, I stopped to watch it. This film is almost like a production of "Masterpiece Theater". It was good with me, I always preferred television and British movies. <br /> <br /> Most viewers would find this too slow. But the slow pace helps to give credibility to the story. The special effects are few, which allows the viewer to think that this film takes place in the real world, which makes us a little more worried. The makeup and costume of the ghost are simple and believable. Hollywood would have made him look like a hell demon with bright eyes, fangs, claws, and so on. Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity. <br /> <br /> The woman only makes about five appearances in the film. Most of them are where it appears in the distance and even that creates a good scare. If it appeared too often, it could have diminished the atmosphere that reigned. However, this film is so well done that we have been made to feel it almost always, but not visible. The scene where she "visits" Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her a little too close is a masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> This is just an extraordinary movie that I think should be among the best. Horror movies ever made. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and one more zillion. I have not seen anything that surpasses "The woman in black", even if I'm still looking. This film is so well done that it gives even the most hardened skeptics (like me) a moment when I almost had doubts about the non-existence of ghosts. I am joking and telling people that I sometimes fear that she may appear standing in the middle of the road or that I can see her staring through my window and so on. Maybe she could be in the crowd at the mall looking at me with her hate look. That's how should be a very good horror movie. Like a LaFanu novel, The Woman in Black attracts you very slowly and wraps itself around your neck and, before you know it, it takes your life and it's too late. <br /> <br /> What I see more closely The criticism is that it was made for the small screen ... and it is really unfortunate that it is exhausted. I just paid over $ 40 for my second copy of this movie. This is a major prize in my collection. Now, I'm looking for an even better horror movie that not only gives shivers, but also qualifies a sound drama.
