Steve Carell once again plays in a romantic and light film about choices, family and pressure. Judging by the plot and cover of the film, I was expecting complete comedy, lots of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Of course, the film had a comedy, but it seemed to me much more a light drama and Steve Carell once again achieved an excellent performance. The film itself really addresses real observations and it is a strong element that I found. But the end felt a bit hasty and predictable. The cinematography was excellent, the acting was great and the message was obvious but very important. Be that as it may, the end was old, flat and predictable. I think that if different choices were made at the end of the film (maybe even for bad ones), this movie would be better publicized. Another funny movie.
