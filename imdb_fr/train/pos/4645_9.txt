This film is very interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems that Glover has put his finger on what he claims to want to accomplish. For my part, I can understand the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current corporate impasse that weighs on all the media and against what our culture is supposed not to "think" because of the control of the media. The indignation that Glover expresses through the "scandalous" elements of the films is at once clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic power. I am happy to have seen this film and it is even clearer that Glover is preparing something interesting with the second part of what will be a trilogy. Its good! EVERYTHING IS FINE. See that too. People who consider this film as "unthinking" or "pretentious" really miss the mark. It's a smart movie. If you can see him with his show that he used to play with his books, it's very painful. The way you enter his state of mind is really something. You will have an experience!
