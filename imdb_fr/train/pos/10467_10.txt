Unfortunately, because of rights issues, this will certainly never happen. The transcripts of Joe Bob's comments on his projected B-movies are available on the Internet, but they do not quite capture his twang delivery, which was a real delusion. Nowadays, Joe Bob (his real name: John Bloom) limits himself to doing the additional functions of classics such as "I Spit On Your Grave" (featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape at the movies of all time), and Jason X, one of the most revered Friday's 13 suites of all time (the show was never the same once it had left Paramount). All I could think of when they canceled it was, "Damn, where can I get satiated with blood, blond jokes, and horrible questions every Saturday night? Does that mean I must have a life now? " Unfortunately, this is the case. But there will always be a place in my horror-hungry heart for "Monstervision". Long live the Drive-In!
