It's a great "little" movie. I say "small" because there are not a hundred shots or a dozen explosions, as in a film by John Woo. Excellent performances by Roy Scheider and the three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. The film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a thread than a washing machine - instead of everything that revolves around, it seems that things get worse as the plot gets tougher. Beautiful end, very positive. I have never read Elmore Leonard's book, but it can not be very different from the movie because it looks like what I'm watching in Elmore Leonard's movie.
