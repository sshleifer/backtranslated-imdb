It is a very charming and fashionable film. The locations are excellent and the situation is one of those old Preston sturgess movies. If you want to watch a movie that does not require much more than sitting and relaxing, that's it. The acting is good and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was also at Rounders. And while you slept. The rest of the cast is fun. This is exactly what happens when two people about to get married meet the one they really like on weekends to plan their own wedding. I know ... it looks weird ... but it is. And that's what makes it fun to watch. This will force your girlfriend to kiss you or leave you, but at least you'll know.
