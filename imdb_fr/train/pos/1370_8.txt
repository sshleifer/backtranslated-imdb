I remember seeing it years ago when it was released for the first time and Parker Posey's performance disappointed me. And the movie was very good too. For those who have spent a little too much time in the nightclub / after normal working hours, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not too serious, especially funny, and Parker Posey clearly shows his talent for this independent gem. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character of Diaz (who reminded me of all the troubled DJs I know). And many other films could draw inspiration from this film on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
