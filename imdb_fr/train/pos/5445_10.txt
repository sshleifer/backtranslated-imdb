I saw this movie for the first time a decade ago and I found it very funny. It was not as bad as some critics claimed. The fact that it was written by the very reliable John Hughes shows that we can at least expect fun dialogues. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is very good and that Hughes also wrote at the speed of light.) <br /> <br /> The film has a very loud look and uses all the primary colors - the reds, yellows etc - which makes it quite unique. The actors are also very good. Bunny Packard and Delores Salk, possessed by the devil, are remarkable. <br /> <br /> The film certainly dates a bit, but I personally prefer it to all the other series of "Lampoon".
