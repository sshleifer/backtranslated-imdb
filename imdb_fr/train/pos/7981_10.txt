In Mexico City, former CIA murderer John Creasy (Denzel Washington), alcoholic and decadent, is hired by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), on the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), his Pita girl (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes Creasy's behavior, makes him live and gives him a smile, and he feels a great affection for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy learns that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears to kill each of those responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece and will certainly become a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never corny and although having 146 minutes of time, the viewer does not feel the time pass. The cast is composed of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are remarkable, including Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinematography has wonderful moments, and the screenplay has breathtaking lines. Personally I loved when the character of Christopher Walken explains to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death and that he is preparing his masterpiece. I agree with the user who said that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best movie of the year in this genre. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("The Flames of Vengeance")
