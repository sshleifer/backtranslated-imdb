"Five Days" is presented as something special, a crime drama composed of a series of episodes, each taking place on the day of the police investigation. But in reality, this element of the story turns out to be a little less important than we thought at first, because the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is barely perceptible, and very little distinguishes the program from countless others. criminal stories. In fact, we can hardly help to make comparisons with the last "first suspect", because one of the subplots is centered on one and the same cynical police officer who is retiring: and it is not only the absence of Helen Mirren makes comparisons unfavorable. There is a lot of manipulative, over-emotional and serious music, and a set of seemingly artificial characters so that everyone is in a sympathetic sense, in another suspicious. And it is possible to guess the culprit well before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but because of the construction of the drama as a whole: some things must be true, to justify the way the series focuses on certain characters at times. Despite these failures, the series grew: in the end, I was very taken. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which has already made the film "The Singing Detective", prides itself on being "probably the best drama of the year": because there is little real originality to propose here , and the statement reveals a lack of ambition that is terribly disappointing. "Five Days" is actually not hogwash; but this is a formula, and we hope that the best of the BBC would be something a little more innovative and fresh.
