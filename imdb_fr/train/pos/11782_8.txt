I do not know if it contains spoilers or not, but I do not want to risk being blacklisted before the year 3462. <br /> <br /> I strongly disagree with the comments of the viewer who have described * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". They can not have watched the same series as * I *. <br /> <br /> The series * I watched describes the history of European colonization in the Americas and Southern Africa without any particular inaccuracies. I did not see anything in the series that portrays Europeans as bad people who have been lucky, although Europeans * have * often * been lucky - and there is nothing wrong with luck . Nor did I see indigenous peoples portrayed as poor, innocent little things. On the contrary, the Inca was rather arrogant - as one would expect from any leader facing strangers, if his country was defeated by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I certainly have not seen anything that can be interpreted as Marxist or neo-Marxist, if not by the most incredible imaginations. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African peoples * have * integrated immunity against malaria and other tropical diseases that are lacking in Europeans. At the height of their success, the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations were as advanced as all others in the world - and as rich; sometimes more. Native American peoples and Khoi-San * were decimated * by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; Just as European settlers were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (NOTE: Khoi-San people are completely different from all other peoples in sub-Saharan Africa.) <br /> <br /> I do not see what other commentators are complaining about. The only thing I can complain about is that the series does not tell me what I did not know when I finished grade seven. There is really nothing new in terms of historical information in this film. It presents, however, some beautiful dramatizations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values ​​are very high; and here and there he fills a few holes that were not covered in the sixth hour of Gruber's social studies at the College of Milan. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this, suppose you have had a good In elementary and / or secondary school, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a nice and entertaining time to see again what you have already learned (or should have learned) before starting high school.
