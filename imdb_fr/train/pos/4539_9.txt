The cast is pretty old-fashioned, but for the people of this 80s region who are now automotive engineers in the Detroit area, it's a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, which makes this movie even more fun. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno showed his age last night on The Tonight Show! He looks very young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, with the brake race on what appears to be Woodward Ave, was excellent. <br /> <br /> Leno also has some bad cars **, it would be great to see a remake of this with his collection. I'm sure Vette in the opening scene was his own car. <br /> <br /> Typical film from the 80's. Watch it and enjoy it. No computer generated shit!
