Too bad a few comments before me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on real events, a high-profile disappearance and a murder case taking place in the Wilmington, DE / Pennsylvania area, from 1996 to 2000. I must admit that I was very skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize the world. The story was actually quite impressed by how close they were to what was constantly reported in local news reports and Philadelphia Inquirer news throughout the period. Of course, I immediately remarked that the actress (whom I like a lot in Cold Case) who played Fahey did not look like him at all (Anne Marie was actually prettier). I must admit, however, that Mark Harmon really did describe Capano's personality type and Capano's behavior throughout that period. The details of the case were accurate ... no deviation of dramatic effect ... even the carpet, the gun, the furniture and the cooler. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I met Tom Carper a number of times (when he was a good man, although he is a politician) and I am very happy that he shot them. strings needed in the federal field to solve this heinous crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars.
