"El Mar" directed by the Catalan director Agusti Villarona and based on the novel Blai Bonet, offers a glimpse of Spanish history as seen by a Balearic author who brings the viewer back to the time of the civil war in this country. The film focuses on three friends and follows them from the beginning of the war in Mallorca until a few years later, when two of these friends meet while they are in the sanatorium, lost in the countryside. <Br/> <br /> We first meet three boys who play happily. Everything is not what it seems. The tragic death of one of them bears witness to the cruelty of the one who commits the evil act. The boys excluded a girl, about their age, from participating in their games. <br /> <br /> When we meet Ramallo again, he will go to the sanatorium. He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis. To her surprise, Manuel Tur, one of her childhood friends, is also well cared for and the girl who was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns who oversees their health care. It is obvious that Tur is looking at Ramallo in a way that only means that he is in love with the harsh bully. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. <br /> <br /> Roger Casamajor does a good job in describing old Ramallo. Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression as Tur, the vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, appears as Carmen, the wife of the guardian of the institution. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. <br /> <br /> "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows the talents of Agusti Villarona to make the novel more alive for the viewer.
