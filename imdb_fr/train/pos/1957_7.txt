Yes, I will say that before beginning to comment, this film is incredibly underrated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is great in her role as Catherine Trammell, just like Morrissey as Dr. Glass. He is an analyst sent to evaluate him after the death of a sports star. Glass is involved in a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The acting game was good (apart from Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent for this role. She is smooth, naughty and seductive and does not look a day older than she was at first. She really impressed me (like in Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed a lot of vulnerability in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was overwhelmed all the way. He really fears. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not as good as the first but Stone is fun to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.
