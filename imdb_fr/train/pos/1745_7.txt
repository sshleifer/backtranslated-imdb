How really nice, charming and cordial this old unpretentious soap opera! I rejoiced when I saw old Lugosi. He is disarming, friendly and lively. It is the document of a profession long lost. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these moderately good old periodicals.) CHANDU is deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not understand the conditions under which these serial publications operate. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> Without revealing too much ?? Chandu is a Western wizard who also bears that oriental name and who also likes to protect his niece against a sect of killers. <br /> <br /> Chandu exercises her supernatural gifts in a discreet and moderate way. <br /> <br /> As for the sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is actually several times kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being asleep with a flower; almost removed from a boat; by a fake policeman; the Temple of Lemuria and its strange and frightening ceremonies resemble the image of King KONG - and are a barbaric mockery of RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Do you want to protect a girl as bravely as Chandu? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old lecherous and heartless, drunk, and that only contributed to his performance. He is the prototypical bad drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. It might sound like a rather twisted tribute to Lugosi, but Wood's biopic on Burton left that impression on Lugosi and he was deeply sympathetic to the decrepit actor. I appreciate the performances of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> This series is unfairly criticized.
