In West Hollywood, these guards were a rough group who, when they came to town, partied quite boldly. After all, trail driving was a lonely affair on the eve of railroads in all parts of the United States. <br /> <br /> The drivers who worked for the track's boss, Gil Favor, played by Eric Fleming, are no different. But Fleming was a businessman, he had a job to do and hired a high-level team to do it. <br /> <br /> With Rawhide's long run and the fact that the regulars have remained largely faithful, we have come to know all the drovers at one time. A few stories have been discussed around each of them, although the main focus is on Flemdy and Clint Eastwood's character, Rowdy Yates, number two in the herd. it's a pity that they are not shown more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If it had been an NBC show, it would have been done in color like Bonanza and would run as often as these shows. We would have much more opportunity to see a man who has become a moving legend. <br /> <br /> Ironically, it was Eric Fleming who left the series before closing the series to make films. He did a few and hoped that the show would give him a profitable movie name. Unfortunately, he was killed at a film location making an action film, drowned in a river. If he had lived, he might have become a name like Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Clint took over at the head of the trail last season and the show ended. And of course he has become the icon he is today and not just in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough westerner with tough guys. No frills in this one, they were cowboys who worked, struggled against the elements and all the situations in which they were every year. <br /> <br /> They really do not do TV shows like this anymore. What a pity.
