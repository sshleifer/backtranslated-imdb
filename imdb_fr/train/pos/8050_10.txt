The most agile fat guy in the martial arts does it again. One of Sammo's first films that made him emulate the hero of his character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is incredibly Lee as in his actions and fights. The way he slips into Bruce's style and then returns to his own more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable it is in his art. Add to that a wacky humor so darling about this type of film and this film that has it all - comedy (sometimes involuntary, like the fake black), action and incredible fight scenes. A great movie of beer and friends that is worth an hour and a half of everyone's time.
