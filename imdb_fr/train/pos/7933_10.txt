Good times to work with the Quiroz brothers and the whole cast for this project as "Guy on the bench". I was surprised how well they managed to capture all the identifiable traits of a real horror movie "B". I hope to have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after the completion of the work and have been publicly recognized several times since this article was published. Once it was in the video store and the girl almost lost her mind. It was pretty funny and it was my first real dedication moment when I signed his receipt. One day, I asked Blockbuster's daughter if the movie was often rented, and she confirmed by looking for it in the computer. At the time, he rented more than Ring2, which was also a new version at the time ... The title really captivates the immediate interest for more urban markets. She also noticed several times that the film was not returned by the client, which led me to believe that the film is so great that good people do not want to return it. Pay attention to the zombies when you end up in the hood you Jaysun Barr (Guy on the bench-2005)
