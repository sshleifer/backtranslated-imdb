This is a sprawling remake (4 hours) of the rider Haggard's story, with the usual added female and an extraneous secondary plot with Russian soldiers seeking a "power stone" buried with King Solomon's treasure. It is very well filmed, giving a keen sense of the great spaces of Africa and very well played. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help save her father. Sided Onyulo like Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not named in the IMDb list) are also memorable. Still, Hollywood can not leave a good story alone when it fits, it is well told and, except that it is too long, I enjoyed. 6/10.
