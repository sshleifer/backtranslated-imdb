I've seen just about every Miyazaki movie, and they're all beautiful and captivating. But this one exceeds the others. This movie totally impressed me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, as well as their sweet and friendly friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also superb and the music perfectly captures the feelings of the film. But the characters are the highlight of this film: they are so developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now, let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the film (with English subs). Although the English dubbing is good (most of the time), it only fades compared to the original version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. So I suggest to see (and hear) the film as it was originally.
