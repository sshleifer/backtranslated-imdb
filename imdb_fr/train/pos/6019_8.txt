ZP is deeply linked to the dream of youth represented by the hippie movement. The academic debate that took place at the beginning of the film describes the cultural situation that gave birth to this movement. The explosion imagined by Daria represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all the enormous transformations undergone by society. Finally, Mark's death anticipates the end A sees for the movement itself. The film will be easier to understand if we go back to this time of life. During the 1960s and 1970s, young people were the driving force behind deep explorations of change. One of the most significant changes was to get the sexuality out of the closet and I think that the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy, but the sexual relation that men and women freely maintain in the hipotetic situation where he there would be nobody to hide. I looked at the scene where couples were throwing sand at me and I appreciated how beautifully A described the impossibility of continuing to hide this basic human instinct. Punishment was the way to "control" social explosions at that time and this is the method the police apply to arrest students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and it is clear when students have access to weapons that allow them to avoid all false controls. The dialogue between the police officer and the college professor, detained without reason, shows a part of the society interested by this feeling of youth and a completely indifferent part. Presenting flight as the most accurate symbol of freedom, the flight of the plane represents Mark's inner wish, but his return (return or return) shows the difficulties in freeing himself from these bonds and said, A represents the death of the dream by these difficulties to win the match. From my point of view a movie to remember.
