A must for any punk rocker, this is the movie that made The Ramones a well-known name in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable channels). It was one of the first and best American Punk Rock movies, with a classic cult status with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally, producers wanted Cheap Trick to be stars, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" had just turned them into superstars and a product too popular to be part of a movie at small budget. Very good luck for the Ramones who were looking to get out of the underground punk rock world and enter the mainstream market (which unfortunately never happened before the breakup of the band). The group, Dee Dee in particular, has always hated the movie in the 80s, but fans have always loved and could recite most of the film while waiting to see Ramones' shows. This film, like most classics, is a stupid fun with some classic Ramones sequences at their peak. Do not expect more, you will not find it. It's very fun, so enjoy it. Another classic film by Allan Arkush in the same vein is Get Crazy, with Lee Ving of legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
