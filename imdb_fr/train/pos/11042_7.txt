In a penitentiary, four inmates occupy a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the dredge Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégé, the late Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month-old sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old newspaper hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and speaks of black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape the prison when they discover the truth about Danvers' fate. "Maleficent" is a French horror film with a small budget, original, intriguing and claustrophobic. The story is almost in the same place, has no clichés and draws the viewer's attention to the last scene. I am a big fan of French cinema, usually novels, dramas and police stories, but I noticed that I recently saw some good French horror movies, such as "A Children's Game", " Belphegor "and" Dead End ". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("The signs of evil")
