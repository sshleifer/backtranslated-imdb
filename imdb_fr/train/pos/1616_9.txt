A delirious romantic comedy with interlaced secondary intrigues that fit together beautifully and actors who are bouncing against each other with precise and comical timing, a feat of great beauty. When Cher's fianc√© without tender asks her to help him make peace with his morose and helpless younger brother, no one can imagine the consequences that will follow. Opera symbolism, Catholic church confessions, love bites and snowfall ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. The rhythm of the image takes about 15 minutes (there is a hasty sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery, and a subsequent scene with Cosmo and the old man at the door that seems obtuse), but the patchwork of the intrigue is intertwined with clever skill, and the unstable tone of the film and its perverse mind are both contagious. *** 1/2 of ****
