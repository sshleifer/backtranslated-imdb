Fascinating, I approached I'm curious (Yellow) and it's an accompanying piece that causes great concern. I had read many reports about his widely vaunted controversy and explicit sex. What I had was not that, but a provocative and captivating cinematic experience unlike any other. I sincerely believe that the majority of commentators who felt that the film was "lame" or "boring" approached it as if it were pornography. It may be pornography, assuming that it is meant to titillate the senses, but it is intentionally non-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws it entirely into her performance by giving it a realistic realism and a simply convincing and lasting humanity. Her breasts can be drooping, her nipples unusually big, her fat thighs and her chubby face. But at the end of the film, the audience identifies with her and accepts her faults as a human. This touch gives him even more credence on the need. If the director had thrown a bomb of Briget Bardot, the effect would have been canceled. I can not recommend this article that provokes reflection. Get ready to invest a lot of thought into this deliberately deliberate movie. The patient, unpretentious viewer will be rewarded for the way most other films might dream.
