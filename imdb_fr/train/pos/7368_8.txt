I think the team behind this movie did a great job with its limitations. only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and edit everything, which, in my opinion, is a feat in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as an innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism in the story), I think this film is a heartbreaking tragedy and that more sadness that you feel. more to Heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned. <br /> <br /> this is one of my favorite British movies that I loved and would watch again. I think it's unfortunate that the films are not heard at all.
