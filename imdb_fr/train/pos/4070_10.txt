I know Anime. I went there before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about it, let me tell you this: Of all the anime I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious that people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know this film because it is an Acedmy Award; this is not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who had only seen Spirited Away, and they agree that the latter two are the superiors of the three. Personally, I had never thought anything could be compared to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think the prior is the best of both, but Castle in the Sky is easily comparable to this one; In many ways, Castle presents some of the major elements that Mononoke lacked. In both cases, if you've only seen Spirited Away and think it's Miyazaki's best film, get ready to shake your planet.
