It's easy to see why Panic has never had a satisfying theatrical release: it's far too clever, and the public would probably have had difficulty with that, comparing it to American Beauty in its investigation of a midlife crisis, and Sopranos and Analyze this in his study of illegal activities in the middle of family life. Although panic may seem to come from a non-original material, Brommel's realistic characters, combined with skillful dialogue and careful direction, make the film a realistic look at the loss of a man of a certain age. , a hitman who works for his father (Sutherland). He leads a double life, with his wife (Ullman) and son ignoring his real job. At his middle age, he is more and more disgusted with what he has done all his life. Under his calm, the accumulated facade gives rise to repressed resentment with regard to his father's control of his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels invigorated and decides it's time to leave the family business. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter / director Henry Brommel has decided to make the profession his main character. away from contract-death is disposable. He could easily have replaced it with an undesirable profession; his characters are so well developed and believable, the scenes managed with so much gentleness and realism and the dialogues written so insightfully and naturally that the emphasis is on the conflicting character of Macy rather than on his job as a hitman . Brommel's script looks like a Shakespearian tragedy, with a well-defined theme of destiny. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Macy creates a tragic, easily understanding character, and turns into another great performance, as expected. Donald Sutherland is also an aggressive and abusive man as a domineering father, and Ullman's dramatic turn as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Imagine a scene in a bike shop, where his mood gets subtly darkened and culminates in a disturbing scene of emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> The first feature film by Henry Brommel, Panic is a film well designed in its sincerity. With a leading cast, a plausible scenario, a concise dialogue and a precise direction, this character study is, hopefully, only a foretaste of Brommel's ability to create characters that seem real. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
