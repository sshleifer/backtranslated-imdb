It's the quintessence of the fairy tale! The bad guys are completely bad and the heroes are refreshingly clean. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful, as is the new actor who plays Tristan. Exceptional performances, delicious, funny and dramatic magic, and a perfect fairytale ending make this movie absolutely fabulous! I'm not sure that all the content is suitable for younger children, but for an older audience, there are a lot of hilarious subtleties! The previews do not do justice to this movie! My fiance and I were quite skeptical, but we were so happy that we took a chance on this film that I can only hope to assure anyone on this movie to try it!
