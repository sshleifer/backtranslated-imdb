I really do not understand why people are so upset and panic this movie! Remember, it's a SNL movie, not a movie supposed to be unpredictable and original in intrigue or direction! The Ladies Man is a hilarious, though sometimes silly, film with a delirious cast and, as usual, great performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are amazing but his comedy! I really do not understand how anyone could laugh a lot during this hilarious movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people take it like that: a comedy for SNL, silly and irreverent. Nothing that can win prizes, but nevertheless, some gold from modern comedy. "10-4 apricot!"
