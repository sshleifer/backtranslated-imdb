This film scares me since the first day I saw it. <br /> <br /> My mother had seen him when he was on TV in 1992. I remember being woken up in the middle of the night by his crying tears as my dad helped him up stairs. <br /> <br /> She said something like "Do not let her take me" or something like that. I asked her what made her so angry and she told me that she had watched The Woman in Black. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that I had to watch it and even if I was only eleven, she left it to me. It scared me. I'm immune to horror movies since I watch this!
