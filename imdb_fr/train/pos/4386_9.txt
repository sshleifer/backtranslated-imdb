It's a powerful film. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accents kept me from understanding a lot, which ruined the viewing experience. I abandoned the project, then I acquired the DVD, used English subtitles when I needed them and I really got into this film, discovering how good it was. It's excellent. <br /> <br /> The widescreen image makes it spectacular in places, with beautiful rugged landscapes and history reminded me of Braveheart, a story that was both catchy and good versus bad. Here is Liam Neeson (good) against Tim Roth (bad guy). Both are doing their job well. <br /> <br /> Few actors are as despicable as Roth. Dude, you really want to hit this guy in his arrogant and irritating puss. (He is so ugly and vile that sick critics love his character more than anyone here). Neeson is a man and a solid hero figure like Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong here as the main woman. The film attracts you and totally involves you, so get ready for an emotional experience by watching this.
