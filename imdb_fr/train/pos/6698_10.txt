I loved Sabrina the teenage witch and saw all the episodes. I remember when I spent every night at 6 pm and was waiting for Nickelodeon to come, but when Sabrina left high school, the show started to get worse. The best series must be when she was friends with Valerie (I do not know what it is). From there, the next series (Dreama's friends) was still good, but when she left high school, it did not seem right. All the main characters seemed to be gone, which meant he did not have so much old "flicker". However, the first series where Sabrina is at university is still relatively good and observable, but when her aunt leaves and Sabrina moves to their home, it's not fair. She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not fair and without Hilda, Zelda and Josh, the show does not seem fair, especially when Sabrina is almost married to someone who is not Harvey. Thank God, he won in the last five minutes of the last episode. All in all, I always like to watch the old episodes of Sabrina, the teenage witch, but I think the writers pushed her too far and they should have left her out of high school. After that, the show definitely lost its magic
