I came across this series rather by accident. After half a episode, I became hooked. American Gothic was a dark and strange series with Gary Cole in the role of the mysterious and probably naughty sheriff Buck trying to take control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. Gary Cole's sinister sheriff impressed me and Lucas Black impressed him even more. Caleb by Lucas Black was able to compete with Sheriff Buck, one of the scariest characters ever created for a television series. I have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence and talent as Lucas Black. If you do not have the chance to see Lucas in American Gothic, see it in Slingblade. <br /> <br /> It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during its short duration.
