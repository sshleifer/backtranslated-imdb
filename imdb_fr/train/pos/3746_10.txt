I like this movie / short thing. Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite parts are The French Song and in the opening title when the soldier with the spatula shouts "SPOONS!" I crack every time. I would recommend this film to Knox Klaymation fans and people who like other Jason Steele movies. His style of animation is very original. Some points of view are needed to notice detailed backgrounds. His humor is also hilarious and certainly not something you heard before. Like Max, the distorted Spatula that has in his head a sound and light system that emits colorful lights and a joyful music every time he talks about his miserable life. It's a wonderful animation to watch anytime, anywhere.
