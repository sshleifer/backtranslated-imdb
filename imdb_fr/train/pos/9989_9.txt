I was lucky to see a screening of this movie recently. I think it will be in movie theaters in Canada towards Mother's Day. If it's in a theater near you ... GO! This is not a funny film, but rather a reflection film. <br /> <br /> The director does a great job of character development - letting you into Hagar's heart, mind and wounds little by little. At first, his attitudes and behaviors do not make much sense. Throughout her story, she becomes a person you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found her nice at the end of the movie - especially when she opened her heart to the young man in the lake hut. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with his two sons is painful - and reflects many of our own experiences in this world. His youngest son, John, full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the edge of his seat - and in the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see. Ellen Page acting in this movie. She is so different from the young woman that she plays Juno. This gives me an even broader appreciation for his ability to act. If you liked it in Juno, you'll love it in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is Ellen Burnstyn like Hagar. There is probably no way to express the power to act as strong as the ability for the actor to make you forget all the other characters they have ever played. Never in the film had I thought of Ellen Burnstyn - I was always thinking and only about Hagar. She carried me in her character - hook, line and lead. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's ability to record on film this well-known book by one of Canada's most beloved authors is impressive. She brilliantly brings to the screen the stony and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar - the stone angel.
