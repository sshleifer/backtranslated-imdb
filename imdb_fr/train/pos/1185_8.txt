Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger reverse the role they played in "All the brothers were valiant". Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his role as villain but Granger plays his role perfectly. However, the real hero of the story is the bison and the northwest. The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the time wonderfully given. The staging is tense and although the film is not a light entertainment, it is, in my opinion, a major film, unjustly ignored by cognoscenti.
