Woody Allen is not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point". It was an excellent black romantic thriller that luckily was not performed by Woody Allen. There was the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film and although it appears in this one, everything is fine. Scarlett Johansson and the two work perfectly together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays the role of Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who takes a scoop from Joe Strombel's fantasy (Ian McShane.) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the mower and a host of other souls taken by the mower. One of these souls is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman). She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer wandering the streets of England. Joe, with the scoop of a life, comes back in life and gives this information to Sondra, during a magical act. Sondra is at a magical show with magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to go into an endangered box and while she is in the box, she receives Joe's visit. Not knowing what to do, she turned to Sid Waterman for help in solving the case. <br /> <br /> This film has a light air, compared to "Match Point" and yet everything works. . Johansson and Allen work very well together. Allen's humor is perfectly suited to this story and role. Hugh Jackman is terrific in the role of Peter Layman, the "alleged" serial killer. <br /> <br /> It's a fun little movie to see if you're looking for one to watch. The whole cast works well and the story runs and you sometimes forget that you are watching Woody Allen being himself. I say give a chance because you could like it.
