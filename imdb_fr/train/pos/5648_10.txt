I recently bought the entire American Gothic series on DVD and it was true to my memories. I was very grateful to be able to watch for the first time ever-televised episodes. I loved Ring of Fire, especially stories I had not seen the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic as "naughty, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also an excellent player. I thought Brenda Bakke in the role of Selena Coombs was also superb in her performance. In fact, all the actors were incredibly talented and had excellent chemistry. <br /> <br /> Too bad that the series was botched by the network (in collusion with a growing group of censors) because it was truly designed for adult viewing. Mixing comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance and horror genres, he offered brilliant interpretations supported by an exceptional level of genius. life. Long live Gary Cole (sheriff Lucas Buck), the most sumptuous "fallen angel" of all time.
