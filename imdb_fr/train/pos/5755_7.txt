It's a strange movie. It is an exploitation film characterized by exaggerated violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual to be built around rural characters at war against each other, as opposed to an "other" invader. <br /> <br /> The film is an excessive stereotype of veterans of Vietnam, in a long series of films describing the veterans of this war as dangerous psychopaths. The last sentence of Kris Kristofferson is "I have not lost the war yet", as he is about to die after being the victim of a series of killings and destruction, including the police chief of the city and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly scary scene. However, Kristofferson is a pretty good actor and charismatic enough to wear this villain with surprising depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity, is superimposed on his clear goodness. The film resembles the plot of Winchester 73 where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The film has a b-movie action, although the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, a superb director Victoria and Bernadette Peters give it a quality range A. <br /> <br /> > I give him a 7 for having long lost sight of the American psyche of post-Vietnam / pre-Reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a film industry that was willing to address such topics to this time. <br /> <br /> Seen on the THIS channel, a formidable network that continues to broadcast many old movies from the 70s to 90s, political trend.
