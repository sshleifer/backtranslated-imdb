I am surprised that we see only one non-sayer criticize this old movie. We do not usually get good opera movies, and here's a real grand interpretation of opera. Naturally, the visuals are not great. It's dated. But as an opera, nothing can be blamed. and I am an opera lover. I can not even detect a lip sync; If we did not know that Tebaldi was in the audio, nothing would convince me that it was not Sophia Loren. She does it all with talent! His dark makeup is fine; and she brought the role to the beautiful life! The rest of the cast is beautiful, as is this superb ballet troupe. Most of the actors are excellent. Loren really wonderful. His rival Amneris is also great. Anyone who did not care about the work of 1953 is shamefully careless. Verdi would have appreciated! Naturally, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the driving force behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
