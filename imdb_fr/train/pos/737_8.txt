It's amazing that actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after performing Runk Randall, punk rock band fan Ramones, in "Rock 'n' Roll High School". Soles is so exuberant, it does not bother you that she is obviously too old to stay in high school (this fact is obliterated by the fact that all children are 24 years old). The film is a fast landslide that does not go unnoticed. everything breaks down at the end, and it's as it should be. Mary Woronov, a naturally perverse and amusing presence as a Nazi director, first receives a great, one-of-a-kind piece where the Frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many shots did they use in this regard, or was it a chance?) and Dey Young is very attractive as the best of Soles, Kate Rambeau. Ironically, the weakest link in this chain is "the Ramones". They can not play, they are not funny and their concert segment lasts too long. A Ramones song, "I Want You Around", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; the other fortuitous songs are good, especially a rare ballad by Paul McCartney heard at the very beginning ("Have we met somewhere before?"). Very funny! *** of ****
