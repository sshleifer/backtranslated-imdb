What can I say about this film that has not already been said? Well tell the truth a lot of this looks very fake like some of the slaps and kicks. How Charlie Sheen if it was true I do not know. I'm sure they would hit her and hit her much harder if that were the case. However, the scenes with the pinch and the hot oil seem very real. and the last hand in the eye scene is incredibly well done and probably the only thing about a movie that ever shocked me.
