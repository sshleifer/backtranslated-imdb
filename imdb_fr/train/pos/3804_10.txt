My 3 year old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 of our family. As for the level of violence? Not really violent, especially of the slap stick type. Nobody really dies, no blood, no blood, no torture, so it's certainly appropriate for children, much more than a lot of Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This film really takes the idea of ​​CG movies where he should go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, beautifully realized textures, with a real depth, without trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. Moss on stones, rust on metal, reliefs on wood and stone all add to everything. <br /> <br /> The modeling of the characters, contrary to many current synthetic films, is original, not cute, in an artistic ensemble. Faces may seem less malleable than some other movies, but the characters are more like puppets than humans. I think it's a good thing. This confers truthfulness. As it may sound strange, it is easier to suspend your disbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, furs, clothes, tied, at least with the likes of Pixar. Just note in the opening scenes that Lian-Chu is fighting the giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of farmers and all have detailed clothes that led me to pause the film just to admire it. <br /> <br /> The frame. Well beyond the likes of Cars, and even Wall ?? E. The space has been done several times, but the fantastic surroundings of the Dragon Hunters are only comparable to scenes from Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings, but again, this is an artistic ensemble, with many good ideas launched without effort. Beautiful views like Monsters Inc., where they walk through every door in their warehouse, or Wall ?? E, where we see the huge garbage towers he built, abound in this film, everything is grandiose, but has never been neglected; it's just the bottom all the way! The interlude where they walk in the area with the fantastic falls. The wall of China, the islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? It's really where I think CG should go, do something that takes your breath away, and do it again and again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not only epic, and fortunately without. any voice and purely original for the film. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Inspiring cartoons, especially a good use of stretching and compression. Sometimes unrealistic, but 3D models are not. <br /> <br /> The characterization is also well done. Lian-Chu, the soft and uncertain giant, gradually takes confidence in him and focuses on the attention of little Zoe. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo, the cunning director of Lian-Chu, redeems herself at the end, while Zoe has not really changed at all, but who wants this cute kid anyway? I have at least loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal feud within the group is solved by external pressures, just as it should be in a fantastic story . <br /> <br /> The story recalls mainly the endless story, especially the way the world separates. The monsters are pretty standard except the flock. It lacks the emotional impact of Wall ?? E, which is the highlight of this film, but it's a much more fun ride and it does not have the boring music scene that is played in the previous movie and that has an action of the first scene. This film is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The whole film contains, as I mentioned above, a complete vision, which seems to have been rigorously followed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It seems that the scene is ready for new adventures, and I hope so. <br /> <br /> A side note, the French actor who plays Lian-Chu looked a little like Jean Reno at first, but I'm glad it's not him, even though he's the one 'One of my favorites. Happy to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give him a maximum score, a little surprised by the mediocre and low note of some; I tried to answer some of the concerns expressed by two of the least voted critics. Talk about this film as an adventure and as a European film, not opposed to Hollywood, but different.
