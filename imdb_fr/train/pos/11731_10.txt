I think this movie is very funny and horror. I like Elvira and I like this movie. It's a shame that the second part of this wonderful movie was not successful, because it's very funny as the first part. I also regret not having seen Cassandra Peterson in other films apart from this film. I think she is a great actress with huge potential. I hope I'll see it in the future in the third part of Elvira's adventures. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and that my heart will be with you. You can count on me. What more can I add? It's a cool and classic movie!
