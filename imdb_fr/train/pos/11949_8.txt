The second Woody Allen film takes place in London. The assassin of Tha Tarot Card kills prostitutes in London. Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), a budding journalist, has been informed that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She begins to love, but falls quickly in love. She is helped by the magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who does not like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like better than last year's match point matchpoint. It was shorter and much faster. The plot is old but I had fun and it let me guess until the end. It's not really a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comic lines (all of Allen of course). He's not one of Allen's best, but much better than his worst. <br /> <br /> The acting game is usually very good. Allen is mean, but he has played this character millions of times before and it has become tiring. But Johansson and Jackman are just great: they have a fantastic look and offer two very attractive credible performances. Also, Allen (surprisingly) is working on their sex appeal - there is a sequence in which they are both in swimsuits to show off their pretty bodies. The only real flow is that Allen still looks uncertain about how to shoot London. However, he is not as fit as he was on "Match Point" - maybe he will get better over the years. <br /> <br /> To see. I give him an 8.
