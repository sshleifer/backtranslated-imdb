Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie boil down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the cast and the team are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura picks up some shots in the fight scenes that take place in the second half of the movie, but that's about where the similarities end. Versus takes place mostly outside, highlighting Kitamura's ability to create an interesting movie B in natural places. For Alive, almost everything happens inside. In small, narrow spaces. Here, the artistic design is thrust into your face, and WHAT is the artistic design! We are treated in several very complex and interesting spaces, and our characters are for the most part confined to these spaces. Another key difference is that we do not have much action here before the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and freshness, here a lot more emphasis is put on the characters and the situation and jokes with your mind. Because of this, Alive is a much more interesting movie than Versus. You can not go and go into a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of zombie cold blood, but you'll be stuck on the screen for almost two hours watching the interactions of some really interesting characters. <br /> <I am now delighted to have ordered the DVD despite a few days of non-life. You should too! But be sure to realize that this animal is different from Versus - it's often slow and requires some thought to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters will take it for the release of the DVD subtitled R1!
