I probably saw this film for the first time around 1995. Since then, I have come back several times. It's good! I particularly like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising". Wow! It was so cool in the glorious days of CG animation. The computer graphics are much older than me, because I know that the movie "Tron" was shot 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early 90s. It was probably the first collaboration of different CG experiences set to music. I love him so much, I think I'll go watch him now. Goodbye
