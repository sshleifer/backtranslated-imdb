Can I be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as simply saying "I liked it"? It's pretty funny in pieces, there are big stars and it's beautiful to watch. The songs (there are about two that are then repeated) are forgotten, but they receive a healthy ironic treatment (like the beautiful Mr. Fairbanks exploding in a frantic Wagnerian version of the ballad Miss Grable has just returned); There is not a lot of dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around Miss Grable, and the comedy may be a little heavy, but the result is still very uplifting. The photography (including real outdoor shots that make you shudder) is amazing, playing with different shades of thick, lush gold. Miss Grable has a little past its peak and its fleshy appearance, but remains fresh and comfortable in this comedy "olde worlde". It looks a lot like "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and this one tends to be hated by many. I suppose that several people would judge "That Lady in Ermine" obsolete and stuffy. But it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move to some dough anyway. My suggestion is: enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the spiritual scenario and all that this film has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with a German and English soundtrack.
