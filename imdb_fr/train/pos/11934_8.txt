At first you think of another Disney movie, maybe it's good, but it's a children's movie. But when you look at it, you can not help but appreciate it. All ages will love this movie. I saw this film for the first time at the age of 10 and now eight years later, I still love it! Danny Glover is superb and could not play the role better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the game. Tony Danza is so credible as Mel Clark. You can not help but to enjoy this movie! I give him a 10/10!
