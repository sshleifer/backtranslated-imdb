A very well-shot film taking place in the early 1960s in communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story offer strong, sincere and emotionally profound performances. A clear description of how the natural trust and naivety inherent in adolescents can be easily manipulated and their impact on the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
