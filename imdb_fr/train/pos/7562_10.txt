As a low-budget company in which filmmakers produce and distribute DVDs themselves, perhaps we should not expect too much from Broken as a disc. And yet, what is most remarkable about this achievement is the fact that this version comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a presentation resolutely refined. <br /> <br /> Regarding the latter, the only major flaw is Broken is accompanied by a non-anamorphic transfer. Otherwise, we get the film in its original 1.85: 1 ratio, showing no technical flaws and looking pretty much as it should. Indeed, since Ferrari makes every effort to assemble this disc, you can almost guarantee it. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the soundtrack. Here, we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​mixtures and although I'm not sure what should be considered "the original", the fact that Ferrari played a role in two means should not be considered inferior. Indeed, although the DD5.1 ​​can offer a more atmospheric viewing experience because of the way it uses the score, both are equally fine and without technical flaws. <br /> <br /> As for the supplements, the disc is very positive overwhelmed by them. Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you will notice many comments, tons of featurettes and various galleries. Indeed, given how everything has been broken down into tiny pieces rather than compiled into a long documentary, there is really little to discuss. The featurette "Anatomy of a Stunt", for example, is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes for the rest of the pieces. As such, we cover virtually every aspect of Broken's pre-production, production and post-production. And while it may have been better to find them in an easier to digest "making of", we have easy access to all the features we would like to see. <br /> <br /> Different This is perhaps only the comments that deserve to be discussed. Again, there is also a predictable air on each of the tracks of discussion. The one that involves the actors is too jokey and does not take the film too seriously. Ferrari's parts are incredibly enthusiastic. And the techniques are extremely technical. Of course, we also have links to what has been covered elsewhere on the discs, but at just 19 minutes, none of these pieces exceed their home. Indeed, overall, a good package of extras.
