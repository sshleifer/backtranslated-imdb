I think this film is well done and realistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood "action" movies and use it as a standard to rate this movie, you will certainly be disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what makes it go above the average action movie. I have no experience of the Swedish Armed Forces, so I can not point out any mistakes in their behavior. But as I have seen the "making of" extra, I am convinced that much has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a movie that I will recommend to others to watch. High quality realistic story and film.
