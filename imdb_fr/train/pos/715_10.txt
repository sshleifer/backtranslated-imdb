All the people who sit here and say that the weak connection of this movie is the Ramones would probably say that Amadeus was fine if not for that irritating harpsichordist. The Rock and Roll High School was centered around the Ramones. How anyone can look at this and not like Joey Ramone eating soy beans behind the scenes to try to keep him working is obviously a wet-on-the-wall papa-o. Mrs. Trogar, white mice exploding, patrols in the corridors ... classics. If you do not like Ramones, you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
