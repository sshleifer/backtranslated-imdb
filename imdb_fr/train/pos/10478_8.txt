<br /> <br /> It's really a must for those who smoke from time to time a reefer in their secret hiding place, trying to avoid being caught by their parents, their teachers, the police, etc. The protagonist is a lady in her forties, living in her mansion, raising orchids and absolutely unaware that her so-called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheats on her. When he suddenly dies, she is confronted with the truth. The usher comes to tell him that she is very indebted. She does not know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain. After long reflections, she decides to get rid of her flowers and start to grow pot ... The story is quite original, exceptional performance! I can only think of a few movies that made me laugh more than this one. Yet melodramatic touch is present. The film is typically British: the jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence. It should not be mentioned that it is recommended to have some rough drafts before watching 'Saving Grace'. It will be so much more fun! Especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my jaws would burst. 9/10
