"The cinema is dead, long live the cinema!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary filmmakers, at the Romanian Anonimul Film Festival, which took place in the third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year's management award went to Jafar Panahi's "Offside". I saw it tonight in Bucharest during the retrospective of the festival. The cinema is dead but remains very animated. Panahi's film is a convincing account of what Iranian society looks like. Filmed digitally, "Offside" is a story inspired by a real-life event that hit Panahi's daughter: the problems and risks involved when it was decided to attend a football match. This is prohibited in Iran, we are informed. What Panahi manages to do is to render with little, but probably with a lot of work, intelligence and humor, the cultural patterns of a society that places women at a distinct level. The absurdity of the laws becomes comic. The film has a happy ending, after all because the Iranian team is going to the World Cup. What I liked the most is the concept, the idea behind this film. I would be very interested to see other Panahi films that were also banned in Iran. I guess he can be thought of as an activist director.
