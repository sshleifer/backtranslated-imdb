As incredible as it may sound, a musical won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1968 - it was the third musical to win the award in five years, the first being My Fair Lady in 1964, and The Sound of Music in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! However, it's Oliver! is infinitely better! No comparison. The first two movies are tasteless wet noodles compared to Oliver! The game is great; the songs are great; the story is great and the dancing is great. This film is dynamic, topical, relevant to the human experience and unlike the overwhelmed gangs of New York, Oliver! offers a portrait of poverty in the nineteenth century in London, England, which evokes sympathy without being condescending. Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it to Oliver! Other actors and actresses, including Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are also wonderful and offer powerful portraits of characters that evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures.
