"October Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, fill your mind with vivid images, and lift your mind. The story of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seems so simple at first, especially when the film takes place in a mining town, where the future is as limpid as the coal masses in the mine. But Homer can not follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Riley (a friendly teacher), staff members of her father and friends, Homer tries to make her dream come true. <br /> <br /> Yet, as in any realistic story, there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston takes us down to the coal mines, where we witness the terrible crisis of miners mined under a rock ceiling. With lighted helmets and curved posture, they looked more like exotic insectoids than humans in the dark. The bushy coughing of the miners and the blackened faces continually recalled the danger that the miners were facing in their work. <br /> <br /> The lugubrious charge of the mine is contrasted by images of the rocket launched by Homer and his friends. Under the bowl of blue sky, rockets are placed on a carpet and thrown into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, what makes the film so appealing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a hardened classic man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite their many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support are also evident. Better yet, the movie is uncomfortable. It does not tie everything up in a beautiful bow. It tears you, lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality, which is important in a film like this one. <br /> <br /> This film can be considered as a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I did not want it to end. Then I realized ... that's what a good movie does to a person. If he did his job, you will not want it to end. And "October Sky" does just that.
