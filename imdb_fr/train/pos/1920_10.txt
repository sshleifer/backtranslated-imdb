Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate, have to deal with their two teenage daughters and their strange son ... But after John Ritter's untimely death, the series focused more on managing the death of a being dear ... <br /> <I found this show going through the chains one afternoon and I must say that I laughed myself until my ribs hurt me, just to the range of characters; the witty lines and the situation that Paul would be concerned about especially his daughters ... From that moment, I caught the rest of the series when I was free and I must say that the writing was very good..But I was reading about The death of John Ritter ... Shortly after, I watched "Goodbye" in the second part and I must say that I was almost in tears, watching the emotions of the characters, losing a loved one ... How Rory hits a wall of anger and frustration. ..How should Cate sleep alone in bed ... Briget and Kerry discussing what they should have done. <br /> <br /> But the series goes on, Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who laughs loudly, while Cate's father tries to protect his family and give "tough talks" to Rory ... But the truth jewel is CJ ... who is absolutely hilarious as a wild cousin. <br /> <It will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
