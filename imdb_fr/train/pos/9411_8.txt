Sidney Stratton struggles to keep jobs in various textile mills, mainly because of her experiences in textile labs. Stratton is experimenting with a formula for a new fabric that would create the ultimate fabric, a material that never gets dirty, that never creases and does not wear out. When Stratton finally creates the fabric, he creates enemies among all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since a factory has the exclusive rights). Stratton, in his white suit, becomes the most wanted man. England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could have done it. Guiness's performance (and big players such as Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's management make the film a pleasure, but the real hero is the story itself, a great satire on the business world and the industry, with additional elements of drama, romance and suspense. Note, 8.
