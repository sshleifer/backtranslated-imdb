In today's world of digital manufacturing, no computer can replace the actor and the screenwriter. Alas, this type of "character-driven" movie is far too rare nowadays. The performance of Duvall as well as James Earl Jones are faithful to the high expectations of their audience. I wonder if this movie was made for television? He has a personal quality "close" to the story. It's a euphemism to say that the performances are all exceptional. The only thing that prevents it from being a masterpiece of cinema is the absence of a great director of photography, but the pretty pictures are not everything. How can artists like Jones and Duvall continue to produce such a successful work at a time when actors pose for digitization?
