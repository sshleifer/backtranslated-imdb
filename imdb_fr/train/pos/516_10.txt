One of the few best movies of all time. The transition from black and white to color for the sky and earth sequences was management excellence. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely intelligent, the full movie leaves you overwhelmed by all human emotions, and although a war movie it does not discriminate. I had to watch this movie more often than any other movie, and I do not get tired of it. It's a movie that asks you to question your own mortality and beliefs about what happens after we die.
