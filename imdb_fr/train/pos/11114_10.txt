It's probably not fair that I've seen most of the interesting reviews about Sopranos, and then I'm adding what people have forgotten, but ......... <br /> <br /> From the point of view of acting, how could an actor fail with these characters? Each hypnotizes and intense in his quest for life. Tony Soprano, who is a "Capo" and has a mental illness, always sees his life in front of him and knows what needs to be done to survive. Each of his men sees his life practically from the inside as the truest form of voyerism. This definitely brings out a "curious" side in every viewer, and I include myself in that! <br /> <br /> While some of the above do not care about Bracco, I must say that this is the most recent role she has had in the years since Good Fellas. She is Tony's side who makes him listen to reason, which makes him decent, which gives him a respite from his human emotions that he has not felt for so long, if ever. She is simply her savior. (Do not speak in religious tones) <br /> <br /> But the outstanding performance is undoubtedly Edie Falco. See her role as prison guard in HBO's other hugely successful series, "Oz," and then see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. She transcended the boundaries of a recognizable actress. Only actresses such as Merle Streep can escape. A kind of quality chameleon to transcend roles. But as I said before, with a character as strong as this one, how can an actor fail? <br /> <br /> Livia's strength lies in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. She is a survivor and hopes that her husband and family will be survivors. She is prepared for the worst because she knows the dangers of her husband's business, but knows that her lifestyle is more than most Jersey women. She is wise if not wiser and smarter on the street than Tony himself. <br /> <br /> In total, the biggest crime of the Soprano family is that we, the viewers, had to wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This is in my opinion the worst thing about the HBO series. That's what brought The Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, Dream On, and others back to popularity and eventually killed them. Too much space between seasons and very sporadic. Until then, I will watch the reruns in the hope that this gap in programming will be filled.
