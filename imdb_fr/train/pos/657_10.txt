The Mom and the Whore must be regarded as a movie that is both linked to the moment of its release (after 68 years) and eternal in many ways. Certainly, actors do not "play" ... Of course, they talk a lot ... But what they are talking about is what makes life worth living ... or dying. Francoise Lebrun's long monologue is perhaps the most precise and moving text ever written on femininity, virility and love. Not easy to translate accurately, though. This film is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And in my humble opinion, Jean Pierre LÃ©aud is one of the biggest French actors.
