I have never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... until now. She was really amazing in this movie. The emotion she must have felt when shooting, taken after capture, does not prevent you from thinking about it. It was a very difficult film to watch, the subject is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless as to sit and watch a woman being abused for an eternity. In fact, I felt that the situation was somewhat deflated when his friends came home and that I did not find the conclusion at all plausible. The director seemed very enthusiastic to use the height in his shots and loved to use the mirror reflections. I think he should have paid more attention to the rhythm of the second half of this piece. I'm sure it's a lot of powerful drama, this film for me, even if it had merit, was just below.
