"Roman Troy Moronie" is my comment on the film. What remains to be said? <br /> <br /> This character really brings out the idiot in Moronie. A gangster gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough without being able to speak intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will remain in the annals of film history as one of the most idiotic of all morons. <br /> <br /> There is of course a beautiful comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and Joe Piscipo too. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that Moronie kept the movie of the rating "R" because he could not pronounce bad language.
