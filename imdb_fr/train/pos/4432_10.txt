I happily admit that I am an idiot for a beautiful film, and camera movements and invention angles that are sufficiently inventive can be enough to maintain my interest in a rather long film. Gojoe, however, does not have the longest length, although it has one of the most outstanding cinematography I have ever seen since the MUSA play of the Korean period. However, Gojoe provides much more than beautiful pictures (just like MUSA ... does not imply a contrast): his second greatest strength is his superb acting and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I must confess that I'm not at all sure what the goal was to try to argue, but it certainly causes reflections along the way. Waves, but certainly thought: p. A department in which the film could have been better is action. There is a lot of bleeding in the film, but the action is filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups and often obscured by objects in the foreground. This creates very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see some more real movements, which would make more credible the fact that the bad guys could sneak into entire armies devastating everyone. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is certainly one of the most interesting and beautiful films I've seen for some time. Recommended!
