BABY FACE is a fast-paced, fast-paced film, knowing that a movie <br /> <br /> only lasts one hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a 75-minute smart <br /> <br /> ! Whether such a vast story can be told in such a short time, most filmmakers today are ashamed. Today's <br /> scriptwriters should study BABY FACE's economy and reduce the burden that so many of their films overwhelm. <br /> <br /> History is not nonsense. An amoral woman first gets rich under, <br /> <br /> and then on the bodies of men who fall head over heels in love. <br /> <br /> It is certain that the production code hailed him redeeming, happy ending, <br /> <br /> but it is not difficult to see in which direction the writers wanted to go <br /> <br />, so enjoy what is there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is great, as are George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as hapless pretenders. Not a good movie but certainly a nice movie. If <br /> <br /> you have never seen BABY FACE catch it the next time, it is displayed on a cable <br /> <br /> or rent the cassette. It's worth it ..
