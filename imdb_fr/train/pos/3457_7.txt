This is the Columbo that was directed by Steven Spielberg early in his career. It's not sensational, but a few fantastic things to come for Spielberg can be seen in this movie. The film is basically the same style as most of Spierlberg's movies and TV series. This means that some characters tend to be quirky and no, I'm not just talking about the character of Columbo. The kind of quirk of character that may be best seen in Spielberg's "Jaws" movie of 1975. But aside from a few hints at the first typical elements of Spielberg, you can not call this movie the work and the beautiful example of a rising star of the director. Although it is not bad, of course it is not, but as I said earlier, it is nothing too sensational. <br /> <br /> This film has really started well and is very promising, but after a beautiful opening, in which as always the murder took place, the film became slower and more boring to watch. Dull because it's mostly a Columbo movie from the book that does not contain memorable moments, not dull because it's a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was pretty ingenious and the concept of having a crime writer murdering his writing partner showed tremendous and interesting potential. The story, however, has not really explored all its possibilities. At least, it's the feeling that this film left me. <br /> <br /> The film was still a good movie to watch thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he's smarter than Columbo, because of his mystery / crime writing and tries to give him all kinds of possible clues to move away from itself. Of course, Columbo knows it better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment, but he plays as usual with the game. <br /> <br /> The film has a good general style and uses an editing position . It is funny to see that most of this is largely in line with Spielberg's later work, especially with some camera angles. <br /> <br /> A fine and perfectly legible Columbo film, but do not leave Spielberg's name attached. your expectations about it are too high. <br /> <br /> 7/10
