I have never seen this film recently on TCM and discovered this story about Poland and a small town that has suffered from the Nazi occupation of local cities, like many other European cities, for example: Norway. The First World War was over and the people of that city were still suffering from the lost soldiers and the wounded that the war still creates. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with one leg lost and was the former teacher of the city. He was raised as a German and was not very happy with the Polish people, who did not accept him either. As Hitler's party became powerful, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi so he could come back and punish this small Polish town for the treatment of him, which was really in his head. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer", played a remarkable role as a woman who lost her husband and had a love affair with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazis destroyed people's families and all their lives. The cattle cars are illustrated in this picture with Jews heading towards the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie and like it, give it a little of your time; This film is very realistic for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly.
