all the actors of the first season were really incredible. The first look you see on Max and Zach goes through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or as I call them the minis. minis do the best acting job I have ever seen done by children. the main actors and actresses, for example Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly, etc. make you forget that you are watching a fictional movie. show that they seem to bring this show to life. All in all this is the best show I have ever watched
