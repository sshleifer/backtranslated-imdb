All those who have seen this film and who have badly commented on it, I refer them to the criticism of this film by Roger Ebert. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and has awarded him three and a half stars. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. It may not be perfect or spectacular, but I appreciated. A Chorus Line is not really a story, it's a group of stories about the life of Broadway's hopes. I read reviews in which people said that too much time was lost in Zach's love affair with Cassie. This is an incorrect view. This is another story with all the other stories that are told about each of Broadway's hopes. What people do not realize is that dancers of Broadway shows go through the same things as the common man. And what I think is really the point of the whole show. It is not only about showcasing the talent of these special dancers, but also to give us some poignant insights to reflect on in general life. It's a study of life as a star of Broadway. Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star is watching this movie with a great sense of relationship, as they have experienced exactly what their characters are going through. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent musical. It has its slow points and is sometimes confused with the rhythm of some stories, but overall, I really appreciated. Examine the movie more closely and you may understand what I'm talking about.
