This film attracts you and encourages you to keep your eyes on the screen. The scriptwriter / director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting angles and camera perspectives that enhance the attraction he will have on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshing, unlike any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie will make you discuss the twists and turns that it takes through the conscious and the subconscious. He has a strange feeling with his dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan really became the insomniac. He is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either! He really put his whole being in this role. From the narration to the way it was shot, this independent actor is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it and I look forward to seeing more information from this writer / director / filmmaker innovative and creative!
