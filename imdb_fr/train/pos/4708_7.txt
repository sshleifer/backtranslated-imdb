Yes, Keaton seems to have really enjoyed making this movie. With a jump in his suit in a striped suit, he will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young man who does it only to pay for the high medical costs of his mother and to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. Nobody even knows that Johnny Kelly is Johnny Dangerously until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & does not like Johnny a bit (& I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a beautiful singing / dancing routine while Johnny does it. I love the part when they are in the vanishing car ever changing! The cop who "calls all cars" is the skipper of Gilligan's Island! See this one for gangster laugh of the 1930s! The gags in this movie are hilarious but you have to catch them or miss them! Look at the background of each scene.
