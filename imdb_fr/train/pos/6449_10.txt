I was taken to this film by a friend and I was skeptical about a Swedish film with subtitles. However, I really enjoyed every minute of this beautiful movie. The useless cruelty that man is capable of has been portrayed with confidence without overwhelming images - although animal lovers may have to protect their eyes for a few brief seconds somewhere for the first 10 minutes. The traditional story of humility against brutality and hope against tragedy has been illustrated from a fresh and satisfying angle, using a range of characters with flaws and very natural characteristics. I particularly appreciated the way the film has managed to address the many aspects of hypocritical human behavior that concern prejudices, discrimination and moralistic pretexts. An absolute jewel of a film that I will promote to all those who will listen to it.
