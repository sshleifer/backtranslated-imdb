I must say that when "Pushing Daisies" came out, the fairy tale immediately seduced me. The narrator made a cake of all this ordeal by making death as banal as cooking pies in the manner of Ned (Lee Pace). And that bringing them back to life was just as routine. <br /> <br /> The trio composed of Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), as well as sometimes Snooker Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked a such delight) has given rise to a fantastic dialogue and foolishness. He certainly deserves the title of comedy / drama (romantic). <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck have formed for a shy and not yet loving couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they can not touch - an obstacle that really does not seem to be an obstacle with Aids such as gloves, cellophane and odd schedules around the apartment. But despite the clumsiness presented when they work their feelings around a strange secret that few people know, they still manage to show their chemistry on screen in touching scenes like when Ned gives the hive to Chuck. However, Olive's presence creates bursting moments in the bakery and unplanned complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> The second season fell sharply, putting a damper on a show that had real potential. On some episodes, the plot was hasty and tricky, which makes you wonder "What just happened?" in the global plot of the dead person of the week and in the dominant plot line. The addition of Chuck's father and his two half-brothers to Ned did not help, and at least one of the lines of the plot felt almost recycled (the episode "Comfort Food" does not look like it not to the episode "Bitter Sweets" because the dead person of the week died in the food?). A few touching moments (the hives) helped to advance the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they got closer, the writers decided to cast another wrench rather than letting the relationship grow (Oliver come back from the monastery, Chuck the dead father comes back to life and does not come back, you get the picture). <br /> <br /> Too bad it did not work, but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way, just enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy-smiley pass and unlikely scenarios to remind you that it's is not "Dead Like Me". Again, it's in the time of "Pushing Daisies", according to creator Bryan Fuller, so that makes it plausible again. <br /> <br /> That should have lasted longer, but it's just a nostalgic thought. Congratulations to any new show that is trying to replace this short-lived gem.
