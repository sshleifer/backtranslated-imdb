I do not know much about the Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra has always seemed a bit shy to me. So when I call it one of my favorites of all time, it has nothing to do with a tribute band mentality. As another reviewer puts it, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism, not realism. It's kafkaesque (a pity that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd, when he was so good as Josef K), it's elegant, knowing, sardonic and smooth. Jeff Goldblum makes his way through a variety of characters, trying not to be shot at and acting skillfully rather than awkwardly, trying to stay on top of what he knows and those who do not know it. he can surpass and he can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball, and the support cast looks good. The symbolism, the settings (the only outdoor movement filmed with Jeff Goldblum down the steps seems really weird after so many lizards in the living room), the dialogue (style, and not practical, the order of the day), everything is a question of interacting characters, not really gangsterism. It's fun to watch, it must have been fun to do. What the critics were preparing is really a mystery ...
