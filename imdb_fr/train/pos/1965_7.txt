I found this film very good in all areas. The acting was brilliant of all the characters, especially Ms. Stone and Morissey. The character of Tramell becomes more and more intelligent and psychologically twisted by the minute. The plot is interesting though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how Catherine continues to write with new ways and twists for her novels. The setting was also fabulous and the atmosphere of the movie was this mysterious, thriller-like masterpiece. Check out this movie now, it deserves better than what it has received from the public, which has been misled by terrible bad reviews on the movie (Before you even start) ..... You will not regret it, if you go see it ...
