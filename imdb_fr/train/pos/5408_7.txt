Among these Pokemon movies (which are in the order of the best for me at least): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and the Unknown, this is probably the one about the environment the most, probably the most beautiful and the most soothing. Whether for you or not, "Pokemon 4Ever" still had a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three points mentioned above, this pokemon movie includes good mood and good CGI (as well as anime). The theme of the film in time is well represented and Team Rocket (the comics relief / garbage) is left with very good gags and ends up being more of the main characters than acolytes. <br /> <br /> The flaws are, as always, the violence and the action rather useless and the villain is rather uninteresting, even more than some villains of Pokémon movies. <br /> <br /> A strange pokémon is tracked by a pokémon hunter in a forest. A young boy tries to save the pokémon and drives him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter a big forest ... <br /> <br /> Curious ? Watch the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokemon fans and fans of "American" cartoon movies, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
