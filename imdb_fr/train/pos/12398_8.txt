What has always been missing in the Matrix story is how things have come to fruition. Do not say more, because this part of the story covers most of the basics. What was really interesting was how political it was, maybe even a blow for the current presidential government. Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in the fight against the robotic horde, which were nothing but servants of humanity. What I also found interesting is the use of fear and the way it is perpetuated by the idea of ​​the unknown. As human beings, we tend to fall into this trap quite often, leaving the lack of logic and thought invading us because people can not believe the opposite. Well represented and put in place, this shows how humans can be illogical.
