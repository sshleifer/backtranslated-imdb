"I looked in the eyes of this island and what I saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the main characters on ABC's award-winning television show, "Lost." The series could be summed up as a dramatic story about a group of survivors of a plane crash stuck on an unknown island, but that would do a disservice to the series. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, between them, and finally between themselves as they struggle against their new way of life and their mutual dependence. The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes obvious that it is not an ordinary island either - and that they may not be the only ones. <br /> <br /> After hearing the concept of this series, my first fear was the lack of stories they could tell us after a certain period, but this proved to be unfounded. The narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the performance is superb. The island is a full-fledged character, and to understand this comment, you must see the show for yourself, which can only show its originality and grandeur. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this review article, only the first two seasons have been broadcast, and they are filled with strong episodes. My only moderate criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit, but thankfully, it returns in an admirable form for the latest episodes. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend a TV series, you should follow right. now it would certainly be this one. If you like thrills, adventure, character stories, actors and the team, beautiful places and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "Lost" is for you. Make sure you start at the beginning.
