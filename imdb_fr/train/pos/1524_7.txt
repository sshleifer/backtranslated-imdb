This film is a classic should be. It's not perfect, certainly. The rhythm, while being perfect for the stage, is in the form of slow film like a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is ill advised to be too kind and too kind. She fully demonstrates her talent as an actress, her skills and her art to convince Joan, intelligent, passionate and confident. Unfortunately, the director missed the goal of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other room has his dialogue been so acute or his lines more musical. However, the treatment of this film requires that you look at him as a lawyer. This film is a case, and the viewer is the judge. This is how this image should be appreciated. 7/10.
