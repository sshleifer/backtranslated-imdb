I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We are always together. <br /> <br /> However, in the 1950s, it would never have been so easy. <br /> <br /> Life in the army had been undermined for action, drama and comedy for years by this point. Mined to death. Mixed relationships gave him new ground to cover. It's old hat today, but then ...? Marrying an Asian at the time meant that you owe something to someone or that you were a monster. This affected both possibilities with the third. Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than usual. It's good, but it shows how good it could be. Umecki-chan made her helluva debut here and although I think she won her statue, she did not really stretch out. It was a role that nobody who had not gone abroad would have recognized and the novelty was the corker. <br /> <br /> The real thief of scenes was Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this movie. Bank on it. And Japanese lifestyles have also been presented in an admirable light. <br /> <br /> A classic.
