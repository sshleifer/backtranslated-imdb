I think it's always the best routine. There are others, like Rock's "brings pain" and Allen's "Men are Pigs", which are hilarious; "Damon Waynes last stand" is also fun, but this routine has no errors. All jokes are funny, and the 70-minute time limit is perfect. Just long enough to last 20 years. I love how it allows the audience to be totally self and unrestricted. I'm a fan of classics and for a guy who has seen a lot of Jim Carrey grow up, watching a more laid back cartoon is pretty cool. Do not put in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something that you can watch if you are puffed up. Thank you Eddie, god bless.
