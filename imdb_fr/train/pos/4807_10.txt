I really thought this movie was superb. Not only is the story correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Victoria's portrayal of Emily Blunt and the way she had kept her mind, even though she had been forced to exile virtually in her youth. Blunt describes the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way in which Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous). The romantic elements of the film are so authentic and tender that at the end of the film, you really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of his life in mourning for Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are worthy of mention too. I enjoyed the beautiful score, which evolves wonderfully with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered cinematography as remarkable, some scenes leaving me breathless because of the luxuriance and splendor they represent. <br /> <br /> There have been so few films as beautiful and tender as this film and its quality as one of the best of 2009!
