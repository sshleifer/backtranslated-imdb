It's a good movie, I played the piece a moment ago. There was an extra zing--. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey and Jason Alexander had a good voice. It was great. The setting was also very good. Except that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, makes it quite long. Overall, I give it 8.5 stars. They also added some pieces, but it was still cool.
