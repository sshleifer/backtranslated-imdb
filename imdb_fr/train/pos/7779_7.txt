It is ironic that during the 1950s, when Sirk had been most successful in terms of audience, he had been virtually ignored by critics. However, he is now perceived as a director with a great intellect who has done his best work in melodrama. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" speaks of the fall of a Texan oil dynasty surrounded by a worthless reputation, alcoholism and nymphomania ?? These are the twisted and fatal links between sex, power and money ... <br /> <br /> Stack draws a convincing portrait of a tormented drunkard, wiped out by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, dementia and deep insecurities? ? <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone succeeds as an attractive woman with excessive sexual appetite, degrading for Hudson and other types in the city ?? His best line: "I'm dirty." In a frenetic scene, we see her shaking, shaking and sweating to become a provocative mambo ?? In another crying alone on a derrick model at his father's office: symbol of excessive wealth and male tyranny ?? <br /> <br /> The frenetic atmosphere is both made attractive and intensified by the magnificent use of colors, lights by Sirk, and careful use of mirrors ??
