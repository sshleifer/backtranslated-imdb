My director's intuition can bring material that needs a boost in the right direction. The young Mr. Lincoln is full of "old-fashioned" values ​​that, in retrospect, despite his two-dimensional representation, are at least more respectable than one might see on the big screen in today's cinema. What makes it so powerful in all its simplicity and grandeur is that it is a real courtroom drama in the form of a history lesson. <br /> <br /> We all know Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president who proceeded to emancipation and who was assassinated after the Civil War. But as a lawyer, he was charismatic, funny in the most unexpected places and a true gentleman. He is not a superhero who can do no harm (which was Fonda's only apprehension before signing), but a character with possible flaws that his innate goodness and clear view of good and evil surpass. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that John Ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost unintentionally. In fact, it's a lie, he tries, but he does it somehow effortlessly in the studio system; he worked independently while simultaneously satisfying Zanuck. He was therefore almost ignored by his own practices of "editing in camera", and did not move it to stay away from the story. It is this strength of conventional wisdom that goes hand in hand with the material, as a kind of complementary piece of Americana from 1939 as seen in Mr. Smith's Goes to Washington (here only is the law and not politics). <br /> <br /> Fonda is terrific in the lead - its first with Ford - and never lets Lincoln lose sight of makeup and a boost in footwear. The personality of Fonda, in a sense, as in Grapes of Wrath and My Darling Clementine, appears in the character of Lincoln. As unlikely as it may seem, no one else at that time would have played it: he is mature and wise, but he has the courage to prove himself in this complicated murder case that he has seen, done, but she did. case. <br /> <br /> Only in small pieces, like this last shot that superimposes Lincoln walking on the road with his monument, and two or three small occurrences during this great parade scene, at the beginning , seem pretty dated. Regarding the goals set with Young, Mr. Lincoln, all were achieved by Ford, his team and his cast. it's not as hokey as one might think, and there's a strong balance of humor and authentic pathos.
