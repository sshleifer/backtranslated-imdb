I have just bought the first collection of this impressive series and even after watching three episodes, I am always fascinated by the elegant style of the animation and the slow but thoughtful actions of the story. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pains. <br /> <br /> Although this episode of the Gundam saga is very cool and presents what the previous series had: an elegant and satirical way of telling the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have the control or power over everything (that sounds familiar to me?), I must say that this one becomes a little too sweet-dramatic to continue to explain the life of the main characters and their incessant need to have a stomach ache about everything what's going on and what they have to do to prevent the OZ band from succeeding in its projects (especially the character called Wufei ... I mean he whines more than an American character on a soap opera.) , do you want?) <br /> <br /> In addition to the exaggerated drama (I think it comes mainly from the dubbing of English actors), this series is always very exciting and will captivate me once again. I mean, it can always be worse. It might look like the last installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, let's talk about mellow-dramatic ... I'll talk about this one later.
