"Foxes" is a serious look at the consequences of growing too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the teenage sex comedies that have overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridging High), the film stands up well to time. <br /> <br /> The theme of teenage anxiety is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago. and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi, Scott Baio (do you remember him?) direct a beautiful and young cast that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film follows four girls from Southern California as they go through a life without sex, drugs and parents. Teens spend their days at school and at school, and their nights at parties, concerts or on the street. They are rarely at home because instant gratification is a pill, a party or an absent boy. <br /> <br /> But rather than condemning them, the film is nice, blaming absent and indifferent adults for forcing teenagers to grow up alone. And it is impossible not to love the charismatic cast. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film ?? a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows. We see girls asleep at sunrise among the objects that define adolescence, from Twinkies to John Travola's picture, while Donna Summers' "On the radio" is recorded below. <br /> <br /> From there, the film gains speed as girls go to school and to life. Annie (rocker Runaway Cherie Currie) is the wild child who lives for the party or the next pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the dramatic queen of boys. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is the shy girl above her head. And Foster is the one who has the plan. It's his job to keep this crew long enough to finish high school, while keeping his mother divorced and desperate (Sally Kellerman). <br /> It's almost impossible work and Foster finally fails. at. <br /> <br /> Despite his age, "Foxes" remains a pleasure to watch. The dated hair, clothing and references to Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill did not detract from the film. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply breathtaking, with breathtaking images of the L.A. Basin at dawn, dusk and night. Giorgio Moroder adds a soundtrack of the 80s with Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the film is that the young stars around Foster never split like the cast of "St. Elmo's Fire" (1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have. But perhaps like Bowling for Soup's "1985" song, they came up against a wall.
