Of course, it quickly became uneven after this film, but from "Knife in the Water" to "The Tenant", we could always count on Roman Polanski to offer something fascinating and unique. Despite many common themes (alienation, paranoia), none of his films are really like each other. The story of this story is somewhat similar to that of his "Repulsion" ten years ago, but the tone is completely different. "The tenant" manages to balance the absurdity darker than dark (I hesitate a little to call it humor, even if the bizarre behavior of the protagonists and the dialogue were sometimes amusing) with a paranoia really suspensive. Polanski has always been a master of discomfort, and the moments of this film are almost unbearable. The strange character of the film is also an advantage. <br /> <br /> In addition to the exquisite leadership of Polanski, the rest of the cast and crew make a valuable contribution. Polanski the actor is often overshadowed by the director Polanski, but his performance here really reflects the clumsiness of his characters and his sense of exclusion. The themes of social discrimination make this film more than strangeness to be strange. The rest of the cast also performs well, including Isabelle Adjani's friendly trick, as well as those of Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters. "The tenant" is often underestimated because of people's willingness to praise "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby", but it's just as brilliant as any of these classics. (9/10)
