It was certainly the case with Angels in the Outfield. It was on television last night and I think I have not seen the movie since my sophomore year and I am now in my fourth year of university. Although the film has many flaws, it's so touching that you can not help but sit back, watch it, and have fun. It's also hilarious. Danny Glover's speech is so exaggerated that you can not help but laugh out loud. This adds to the film and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. You really feel for the characters of the movie even if the development is not the best. A must see. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
