If you have not heard of this Walt Disney Pictures movie, do not worry. It would be ranked among other Disney films for educational purposes such as "Family Planning". <br /> <br /> It was co-produced with Kotex to teach menstruation to teenage girls. As he only teaches superficially, he does not go into details for the animated sequence "Head of Ram" / Reproductive System. <br /> <br /> The film shows elements of the "Wonderful World of Disney" as the turning of the page and use of animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This film is impossible to find. If you can find the film, good luck and enjoy.
