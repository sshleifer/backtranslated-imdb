I had seen this film a long time ago, but I found it incredible and, to this day, it never stopped me from being surprised. <br /> <br /> A magnificent film that describes the story of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink Japanese ships into the port of Singapore at the height of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> These commandos are in plain clothes and are considered spies by the Japanese kidnappers. But something is going on that has not been explored much in any WWII film I saw in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> A close and friendly bond is created between the kidnappers and the captives. They begin to respect each other, while the captain of captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend of a Japanese prison guard. This is the most wonderful part of the whole movie and it really pulls on your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, one day, as the two friends discuss, the Australian captain learns that other captives will be tried and executed for the sinking of Japanese ships in the port of Singapore. <br /> <br /> He mentions that it was his team and not another who sank the ships to his Japanese friend, and hearing this, the Japanese guard says to remain silent because it could lead to the execution of all his group. But the captain remains adamant to confess to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Japanese authorities are condemning them to death in the most respectful manner, according to their rules. This is the highest honor given to captured warriors in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the most impressive part of the film where the Australian soldiers are waiting for their imminent death and the heavy indecision of the friendly Japanese goalkeeper still not ready to believe that why his Australian friend confessed to being guilty. <br /> <br /> I will not give the end here. But it's more poignant than we can even imagine and we can easily move tears in our eyes. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an excellent underrated film that may not have earned the recognition it deserves internationally. Get a copy today and be fascinated.
