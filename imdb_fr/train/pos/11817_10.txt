I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I did not know who the actors were and I did not know that the movie would be different from the way it was screened. But I really loved it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty plays Detective Dick Tracy of the 1930s who fights crime and attacks the city's greatest mafia bosses. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and intends to conquer the city with his girlfriend singer, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who has his eyes on Tracy. The situation is getting worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst is that this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villians are back from the comic collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very colorful and creative. It was fun and fun to watch especially as a child. In his portrayal of Dick Tracy's role, Warren Beaty looked exactly like James Bond in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The cast of the film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, Dors Hoffman, William Forsythe, James Caan, Ed O Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin and Charles Durning. More more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family. Believe me on my word.
