The Lion King series is undoubtedly the ultimate asset of Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece of cel animation. The Lion King II: Simba's Pride is by far the best movie that Disney, or any other studio, has made for an animated feature film. This deserved an exit in the room. The same can be said for this film. It contains the original cast, songs by Elton John, a hilarious story, thrilling action and touching moments of character. All you expect from this series. This is not really a new story, but a background background extended on Timon and Pumbaa and their place in this story. What impressed me the most was the care given to the animation. All too often, Disney speaks of the quality of the animation of their efforts in video and television. But here, they perfectly mix a new animation with images of the original film. The scenes never seem out of place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing like Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly take on their respective roles of Simba, Rafiki and Nala. We even get a return visit from Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas. There are a lot of laughs in this movie. So, if you like the lion king, you need this movie. The story is simply not complete without it.
