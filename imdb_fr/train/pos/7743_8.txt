I went to see him twice in this film, one of my friends went to see him at the release night, and he told me that it was so great that I was expecting a lot of this movie, nothing, I do not Could not enjoy it because I did not look at it in nuter position. The second time, I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After the second time, I felt so moody to party. I loved the music, it's just great. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman improves his talent as a director, he will be a director that everyone will talk about. If you can present this film as a first film, you must be talented. <br /> <br /> The acting game is played by big Belgian stars (Dirk Roofthooft) and by many new talents like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
