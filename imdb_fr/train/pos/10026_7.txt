Without Kirsten Miller, this project would not need to be completed. However, with the beauty and talent that inspires Miss Miller, I would recommend it without hesitation. It seemed that the other players only played for his strong performance. Wagner's lamentable attempt to honor this film was a little disappointing, but his few scenes did not prevent him from entertaining himself. My criticisms focus mainly on writing and intrigue, the assembled group of talents did a heroic job of rescuing what should have been a disaster. Miller's charismatic delivery and calendar were impeccable and credible. She plays the demarcation line between assertiveness and authority, but never insulting, she is actually the structural engineer she claims to be. I would have liked to see it on the big screen, but alas I had the chance to rent it before it was lost.
