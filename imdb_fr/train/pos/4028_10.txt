I come to Pinjar from a completely different context than most of the other critics who posted here. I am relatively new to Bollywood movies and I was born and raised in the United States. I do not have a general basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is necessary. <br /> <br /> Pinjar is in itself only a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line, I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important. movies to come out of any studio anywhere and at any time. On a mass appeal scale, it could have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if it had been promoted adequately in the United States. It could very well have been the movie that put Bollywood on the American map. The American movie public has a long-standing love affair with "Gone With the Wind", and although Pinjar does not borrow this plot, it has some passing similarities. The race time of 183 minutes is huge (by US standards). <br /> <br /> The human drama of a young man is set against the backdrop of the Indo-Pakistan partition of 1947-1948. A woman imprisoned by the circumstances and plunged into trouble that she did not help to create. Placed in an untenable position, she manages not only to survive, but to grow and even to flourish. <br /> <br /> If the story is missing in any way, it's in the exhibition. The growth of Puro (the protagonist) as a person would be better illustrated - at least for a Western audience unfamiliar with Indian culture - if the "back story" of his character was further developed at the beginning of the film. But that would have pushed a film from three hours to three and a half hours or more. Because no minute of the film is lost, and nothing that made editing could be cut to save time. It is better for the public to complete what has been done before than to leave out what is left. <br /> <br /> I could use several words to describe Pinjar: "poignant", "disturbing", "convincing", "heartbreaking" immediately come to mind. But "to raise" is perhaps as appropriate as any of those. Any story that emphasizes the indomitableness of the human spirit against the worst of probabilities must be considered as such. And Puro's triumph - even if it may not be immediately obvious to those around him - is no less than inspiring. For the sole strength of the story, I can not recommend this film too much. <br /> <br /> Puro's portrait by Urmila Matondkar is equally inspiring. Too often overlooked among younger and newer actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to provide a completely believable character in every role she plays. She does not just play the role of Puro, she brings life to the character. Manoj Bajpai's choice as Rashid was inspired. He manages something that far too few heroes of Indian films can: subtlety. His mastery of expression and nuance is essential to the role. His piercing gaze is more threatening for the first part of the film than for all rioters brandishing the sword. <br /> <br /> If you only see one Bollywood movie in your life, install it in Pinjar.
