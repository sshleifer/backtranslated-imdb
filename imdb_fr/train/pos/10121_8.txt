Although not as wild and outgoing as some of Takashi Miike's more recent movies, this is a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is that of a Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to suppress a rising Chinese gangster. What complicates things is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than this one with many complications that keep things interesting and divert things from the central narrative thrust. It is this complication and loss of time of about an hour in the film that makes it an excellent film. (This is a very very good movie) It's really something to see, especially if you do not fear a frenetic pace. <BR /> <br /> A word of warning, the violence that occurs there is explosive and unpleasant. There are also semi-graphic representations of gay sex. If it's not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
