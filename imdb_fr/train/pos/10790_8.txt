This incredibly formulated film from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" team contains some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a TV movie. In addition, one can almost predict the result from the start. However, it's a fun little movie that does the work: it's entertaining. That's all he was supposed to do and that's what he does. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not half bad. The acting is also decent, which is not a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you'll definitely love it. Otherwise, do not waste your time. 8/10
