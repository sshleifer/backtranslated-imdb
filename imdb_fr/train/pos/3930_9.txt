It is remarkable that, for the support group of "Young Mr. Lincoln", Ford chooses actors less known than those of other stars. This not only strengthens his film about Lincoln's central character, but also gives the audience a refreshing glimpse of Lincoln as a man from his place and time, a man driven inexorably into the sentiments of his day and seeking the means to solve them. It's not so much through the words and actions of Fonda that are Lincoln's actions, but in the faces, the reactions of the support players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln's vision, his sense of belonging to society and politics, and the reaction of people. The words and actions of Mr. Lincoln and his confidence in this man whom they saw as deserving of their respect and attention. <br /> <br /> Try this: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, the next time you see 'Young Mr. Lincoln,' focus on supporting characters. You will be, I expect, generously rewarded by a deeper appreciation of Lincoln and Ford. I like to suspect that Ford's narrative through the reactions of Fonda's support characters to Lincoln could have pleased David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in "Doctor Zhivago", in which it is the reactions of the characters of Zhivago support who talk about Zhivago.
