This film completely revolved around the original Dolemite. There was everything that made a good movie .. except for the real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it alone and you know it!) LOL) I admit that I killed my first video tape of this movie and I intend to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible ! This movie has so many catchy lines that it's pitiful! I am embarrassed to say that I know the theme song back and forth! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch to death, and he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were NEVER ready for that! This is a random movie of cops, breasts, chases, bad editing and, of course, martial arts. (Since these are the 70s and I can say that everyone knew some kind of martial arts). I think this film should be restored and shown one night in the middle of a marathon in local theaters!
