I saw this film last night in a special movie theater in Nuremberg, and it was superb. I must admit that the original musical composition of the cellist and percussion / xylophone influenced the atmosphere of the film, but the film itself also played a decisive role in the depiction of the tragic saga Nibelungen. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or Nibelungenlied, I highly recommend this film. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the scenery lavish and exotic, and the drama and breathtaking acting (typical of the "tragedies" of silent films). Unfortunately, I did not see the first part of this duo that concerns Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Nordic versions of the story) begins to plan his revenge against his brothers. <br /> <br /> I also watched this film in German; I am an English speaker and a basic knowledge of German. It was difficult to read? Subtitles (what do you call that in silent movies?) At the beginning because of the old German style, I advise you to do it if you look at it in German, make sure you can differentiate your "k", " f "and" s "in the old script. :)
