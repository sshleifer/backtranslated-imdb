If John Thaw had never played "Morse", "Kavanagh" or played in "The Sweeney" and other productions, we would remember him for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in "Goodnight Mr Tom". <br /> <br /> Superbly supported by an equally remarkable performance of her co-star (the young Nick Robinson in her first role) and a discreet cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's charming novel is an appropriate memorial for her art. <br /> <br /> When I read the story of an old Norfolk widower who was supposed to house a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious chronology error, and we must thank the authors of this film who corrected the problem. Fault. They should also be applauded for not overly sentimentalizing the story and preventing what could easily turn into a mess. <br /> <br /> If you keep a CD or a video library, then that feeling is positive. done for the TV movie is an absolute inclusion must.
