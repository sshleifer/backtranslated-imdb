More television movies should be made like this. I saw it at the time of the first time on television in 1993. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both great, giving very serious and realistic performances. Weber was particularly talented, performing an exceptionally scary and unobtrusive performance as a killer or child molester. This movie really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was both formative and exciting. But the direction in these two works has the same severe and simple realism that is so appealing. If you like TV movies that are not predictable and overflowing with activity, see them if you can. The parallel story on the Hunt and Fahey affair is also attractive without harming the main story.
