What a thrill ride! Twisted and provoking thought. Once again, Sharon Stone impeccably realizes her magnificent and captivating character of the author Catherine Tramell. The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco. The rest takes place in London, where Catherine has now moved. Two lively cities known for their excitement, haute couture ~ and an ideal place for a residence like Catherine Trammel. David Morrisey ("Derailed") plays the harmonious role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character of David Thewlis, played by Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, marks a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Flashy cars, branded clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension, all the "basic instincts". Spirit bending all the way. Great scenario. From the opening stage to the surprise ending, this movie is anything but boring! Everyone in the theater was stuck on the screen.
