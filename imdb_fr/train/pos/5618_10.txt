It's a scary movie. More scary than all David Lynch, and it shows how great the director Polanski is, because it's not his usual kind of work, it's BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> It all starts with Trelkovski moving into a Paris building. He soon learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and he thinks the rest of the population has taken her there. He also believes they are trying to do the same to him. This results in a startling and frightening look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> The entire production is adorned with classic horror: from image to music, the viewer can feel the terror of poor Trelkovski build. <br /> <br /> Are they all ready to kill him? Or maybe just make it crazy? Is there a difference? Discover for yourself. 10/10
