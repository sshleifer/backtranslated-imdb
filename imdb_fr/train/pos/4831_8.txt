I went into that hoping not to love him; I thought it would be terribly dignified and serious, rather painful and boring. <br /> <br /> It's actually a lot better than that and I really enjoyed myself. I do not know much about Queen Victoria beyond what most people know - married to Albert, who died young, and she always cried. Seeing the circumstances in which she grew up was fascinating; In fact, I figured I was hoping to have seen more of the story and I guess we could see a sequel at some point. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is stunning. The sets and costumes are incredibly sumptuous without being too loud and exaggerated. The acting game is of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> In a word, it was great!
