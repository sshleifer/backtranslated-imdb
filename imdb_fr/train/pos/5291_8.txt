It's only been a week since I saw my first film about John Waters (Female Trouble) and I did not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> While the previous film was outrageously exaggerated, Pecker is actually a fun movie that satirizes New York art critics with critics of modern art. Anyone who can not imagine what these "experts" find so attractive about modern art will love to see these pretentious snobs fill up so full on Pecker, a boy who has just found a broken camera and starts shooting at his friends and neighbors. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Last Judgment) was surprisingly good as Pecker. The roles of this film are not lacking in substance, but it really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) presents another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a record year for Ricci (Buffalo 1966, The Opposite of Sex and Pecker.) <br /> <br /> Lili Taylor, who had the only positive role in The Haunting, also played an important role in the movie and really makes fun. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of funny scenes, but I must say that the best was when a crown was coming together screaming, "We want Bush!" "We want bush!" "I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the police firing the dancer. <br /> <br /> I'm going to have to get more work from Waters, especially Hairspray, now that's in the news.
