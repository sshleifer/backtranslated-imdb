I went to this movie while waiting for a scary artistic movie. What I got was scared after fear. It's a horror film at the base. It's not boring like in other horror movies where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. This film does not show you the majority of the dead, it shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best features of the concept that there is not only the house that haunts its visitors. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms, etc. After reading some of the external reviews, I'm really surprised the critics did not like this movie. I'm going to see him again this week and I'm excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because it did what a horror movie should do. It scared me.
