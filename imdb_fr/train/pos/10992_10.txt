Damn, I saw this movie at least 4 times and I'm still not bored watching it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are so good and with the music totally awesome and perfect. This film leaves me speechless. <br /> <br /> CGIs are pretty bad IMHO, but all the visual elements with a black and white print and totally sterile interiors were just ... Just a perfect combination genius for such a movie. The general feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> However, the film had some flaws, like for example. Sometimes I thought the movie was a bit too slow, but I did not mean the scenic parts, I loved them totally. <br /> <br /> In addition, I am very often distracted by the totally complex story, like when he is in the digicorps underground bunker, where all their data is saved and where this conversation takes place with the guy there ... but it can also be just me: D And the end could have been displayed more accented, they should have made the real memory part a little longer and "stronger", but without all these flaws, the movie would have been so good that I would never stop watching it again and again ..
