As this film is entirely in Swiss dialect, it is probably difficult for most German speakers to really follow this film. I do not come from Switzerland, but I worked there for a few years. So I had the chance to understand this beautiful parody of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of movies like this (for example, Scary Movie, lots of parody of Scifi, etc.), but this one is the best of it, which I've seen so far. I give a 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give a 10 is because there are some small details that could have been improved and because they did not provide subtitles in no language of the DVD. non-Swiss to understand.
