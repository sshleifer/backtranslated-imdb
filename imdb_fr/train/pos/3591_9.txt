I never bothered to see this movie in theaters although I can remember hearing the name over and over again. I finally watched it this week and what a treat. For some reason, I expected it to be not very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and found myself completely absorbed. I read a lot of reviews from other users and that impressed me. talk about her fighting in the ring, but what was wonderful with Diana is that she is a real fighter in life. All she needs is to find where she is and the ring helps her get there. A very intelligent story and I'm surprised this is the first time for Michelle Rodriguez - what a great job she did. Adrian and his coach were also very good. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit rough, but it does not matter. The story, the will and the performances outweigh the flaws (which usually come with the shooting of independent films). A convincing portrait of a girl who finds herself and who triumphs over her situation and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
