In the light of bad reviews - or car accidents - I feel possessed to move up a gear and make a transmission to make merit where appropriate and to render a service. I'm not sure people have the authority to say it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It is rare that a film has SUSPENSE. This film has kept the suspense in its entirety, for me, despite all the flaws that it can be. How many movies can say that? Not even a lot of fat. Because of the simple premise, you do not know if people will get out of the life threatening situation, which lasts all the movie. Yeh, the suspension was tight, and on some shocks, the shocks did their job. It's not just a TV movie, but a movie in action; there is no point where he stops, or deviates, or becomes talkative. It would be difficult to make a film like this, always on the road. I only remember Duel, or Speed. The best thing in them too was the constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTING is not bad: the judge is as good as ever and the others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury does not know if this can sometimes be - or seem to be - a little embarrassing. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. Your first judgments are not always right, but I think the main actor was right to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> The STUNTS are mostly fantastic, especially for a TV movie. Their only fault is perhaps the slow, visible and apparent speed. But we all know how Grand Prix cars can seem disproportionately slow. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the fact that THE BEGINNING said: "inspired by a true story." So how are you going to go? You know that the base is. The usual "based on a true story" makes me think that this should be essentially true. But maybe that's my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE THEM: Good idea from the examiner to suggest a tow truck to lift the rear wheels. A few centimeters would suffice. A stuntman could do it at 100 km / h. It's odd that they did not call an auto expert - or an auto electrician or a mechanic - to see if there was a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has canceled the fact that this film is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help him to have a resounding success. <br /> <br /> The quality of the images is a bit sweet for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been wet after the baby, but strangely that The idea of ​​saving lives has been intelligently treated in a pleasant conversation to make it disappear. I guess we know why. End of the movie The suspension of disbelief came out of the top window with the baby.
