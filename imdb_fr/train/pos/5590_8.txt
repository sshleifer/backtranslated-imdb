(No need to recap the plot, because others have already done so.) <br /> <br /> It is understandable that many viewers find what to blame the film. In this context, a film like Ecstasy seems to have gone astray from another planet. I think there are several good reasons why. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the film unfolds in a poetic way, while the camera slowly sweeps the hills, trees, clouds, etc. surrounding, providing a serene and lyrical feeling of a natural. world that integrates the man and the woman in its withdrawal. Together, these two elements reveal a style and dimension that are almost completely absent from today's technology-driven cinema, where rapid editing can distract from the audience, not focus it. In addition, the story is conveyed to the naked eye and not to the ear, almost without dialogue to explain what is happening. This is another extreme departure from today's highly literal tariff, where visuals only seem to matter when they excite the audience. But perhaps the most disturbing - the film is sometimes strangely silent, not in the sense that silent films are silent since we expect them to be so. But in the sense that the characters rarely speak when we wait for them. Thus, the burden of the story is shared between the filmmaker and the viewer. The first must choose his visuals with art in order to convey the story, while the second must reflect on these visuals, because they will not be explained. <br /> <br /> None of this is aimed at minimizing today's movie. -manufacturing. It's just a matter of emphasizing that a film like Machaty's is from a very different aesthetic than we have today. I do not pretend to be better or worse. However, I argue that ecstasy represents a perspective that is sorely lacking in the current cinematic experience, where such "contemplative values ​​are regularly considered slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not a masterpiece, although it sometimes reaches artistic heights, as in the beautifully decorated open-air cafe scene with its latest crane lifted which reveals the exquisite picture below. The slow cooking pots of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed. These are the kinds of scenes that do not overwhelm you, but instead - half-luck - quietly accumulate in an experience as memorable in its own way as the thorny variety of a "Jaws". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy, as when Machaty stacks the images, especially in the final sequence ode to work. It's hard to know what to do with this rather disturbing presence. Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the amorous hero and the people in general - a theme that is then promoted by influential Soviet cinema. Nevertheless, his presence here is quite tedious. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I must admit that I first connected to see the beautiful Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now, I have to admit that in the process I also have a lot more than lovemaking in the woods.
