As someone who has never condemned Adam Sandler in terms of talent, as he is for him and many comedians like him, I went to Reign Over Me, waiting for a good movie, not just because of his presence in the movie, but because I thought it looked great overall. Even someone who already thought that Sandler could produce an effective dramatic performance written here I was surprised at how fantastic he is. He will make you cry, especially in his deliberately sudden and unexpected monologue. What is amazing in his role is that he is a character difficult to assert. We've seen a lot of emotionally scarred characters, a lot of mentally retarded, a lot of loners, a lot of egocentric passionate artists, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is not one of them. He may have a taste of each of them in some ways, but his character is truly unpredictable and totally individual. It is a joy for the public to be emotionally driven by him and to be dragged in all directions by a person whose problems, state of mind and provocations are completely different from those of most characters. like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle delivers an interesting commentary. performance at a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal person possible in the world, so much so that it is difficult to find many characters like his, or at least those who are interpreted as he plays Alan Johnson, whose name is even on the Mountain range. Cheadle Shine is awesome, he's funny, smart and stupid like so many normal people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is populated by actors and actors who have done almost nothing for a while. in smaller but colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the over-refined middle-class wife, Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge, Robert Klein is the desensitized father-in-law of Sandler. <br /> <br /> The script of Mike Binder is very brilliant because it says something deep enough about the wonders of communication in all its forms. It's much more subtle than Babel, for example, and his ideal is much closer to home. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of its images, as opposed to its style. This film seemed to me like a kind of back to the kitchen sink style of the 1970s. The cinematography was granular and untied, but that was its charm. It was not a question of drawing us to the camera itself and to the gloss that diluted her stories with such a thing. <br /> <br /> The music, which plays a major role in the film, and its title, is very powerful. At first, you get the impression that you're expecting another soundtrack from the series About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine, but you soon realize that you're doing more than that. In fact, the film is full of music that stimulates the most moving scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is a major statement, not only for the company, but also for the film. This shows that even the director of Blankman is capable of wonders.
