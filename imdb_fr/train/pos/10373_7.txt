The family of Mat Spirogolou (Toby Malone) knows he is a talented footballer and he is delighted that he gets an audition to join a big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city, his cousin will take care of him. <br /> <br /> But the cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: a naive farmer, the other a clever spender who has managed to mix with drug traffickers and gangsters. It is unlikely that Mat will spend a quiet evening before his big day. <br /> <br /> After missing his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on his arrival in town, Mat is still in trouble when a young biker takes him on a tour in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably best known for his work in the theater, praised the role of the bucolic teenager. There are obvious signs of a low budget, but as in so many other low budget movies, there is more fun, apparently more spontaneity and more charm than in the average Hollywood blockbuster.
