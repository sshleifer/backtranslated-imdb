As many critics have noted here, the movie version differs a bit from the story version of the story. I have never seen the scenic version of the story, and as a result, I have a more favorable film review than many other commentators. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for the director of the film, but the film is still an entertaining tale of several dancers trying to make a difference in the show of choreographer Michael Douglas. The film is right not to select famous actors or performers in the final test group. In this way, our attention is focused on the movements, the individual stories and the struggles of the dancers during a day of marathon testing. Douglas is probably not the best choice for the game. Apparently, some songs were chosen for a new song, and the story of a romantic bond between a dancer and the choreographer was added behind the scenes. I must honestly say it was the weakest part of the movie. Cassie's repeated intrusions during the essays seem to reflect the almost desperate pleas that one often has to make when engaging in artistic professions in the absence of talent and / or luck. However, this aspect of the film was made to death in the past, and it is curious to see this tired old shoe get up again. The revelations of the dancers themselves started quite promising with the "I can do it" number, but it then worked slightly at different times while the dancers were telling their stories. Frankly, their stories differed little from those of real life who never had that chance. *** of 4 stars.
