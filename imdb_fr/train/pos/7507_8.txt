Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is compiling a list of films that give a glimpse of their era. His previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best by commenting on the quirks of the company at that time. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously about Mrs. Page, it's just as much a summit behind the curtain of the world of perverse photoshoots from the 50s. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to look both from the point of view of the story and the technical aspect of how it was filmed and edited. The film and the grainy B & W photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast is strong with David Strathairn Murrow), Chris Bauer (under the name Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is Gretchen Mol, a wonderfully talented, underrated and under-worked woman. Ms. Mol always brings a benefit and a spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little-seen, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here is the notorious Bettie Page. His smile is captivating and his body is flawless. She seems to really appreciate this role and helps us understand how the young girl from Tennessee could become the queen of the pin-up hell. <br /> <br /> As one might expect, the soundtrack of this era is fantastic. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured artists. Although the film suggests a history of this industry, the last third falls a little flat, thus preventing the magic of the film. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make it a fun movie to watch, which will produce endless screenings on HBO in the near future. Now, does anyone want to make Mrs. Mol the star she should be?
