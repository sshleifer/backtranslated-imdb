I claim that no matter what effort I make, I will never find a better film version of "Othello". If you like Kenneth Branagh's magnificent masterpieces, "Lots of noise for nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as much as I do, I'm sure you'll find Oliver Parker's "Othello" irresistible . Laurence Fishburne has played various splendid roles during her career. He was great in "Boys n the Hood" (1991) - I always considered his fun role of Furious Styles as his greatest achievement. It was, of course, long before I saw that. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and probably plays the most difficult part of his career, but he does a brilliant and fantastic job. Irene Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is simply phenomenal in the most fascinating role in history, the twisted, the nasty Iago. The wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among the ingenious works of Shakespeare. He deals with his favorite subjects: cruelty, envy, deception and jealousy. This film adaptation is certainly one of the best movies I've seen, based on William Shakespeare's plays.
