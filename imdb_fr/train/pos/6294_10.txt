This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic gags and sight, a tribute to the first films of Buster Keaton. A lot of slapstick: Buster falling on a partition door, falling into a puddle, running around trousers - less. The stupid invention of a scientist by the scientist, reminiscent of a Flash Gordon idea of ​​what would be the future. Cheap prices, like $ 1.95 for women's hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef, seem shockingly high for Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. What a shock when it is transported by mistake in the "modern" world of 1960! Buster was trying to go back! The "scientist" of this time wants to return to a quieter world, that of 1890 that he studied and admired. They go back together and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" regrets not having electronic equipment, modern beds or blankets. So, Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This twilight zone does not have a heavy message. Since the death of Buster Keaton in 1966, this is one of his last efforts. It's enough. <br /> <br /> Another great thing: a long under-used Maytag man, Jesse White is a repairman who repairs the helmet: he prefigures his career in the washing machine.
