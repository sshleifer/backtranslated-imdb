The best Cheech & Chong movie to date !! Of all Cheech and Chong, it is certainly the best so far. I think I have seen them all about twelve times at least and I love them all. But it is certainly the best. Compared to others, it covers many topics and makes you laugh. Some of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope one day they can do another, because they are always great comedians. I heard they were writing a new script so who knows ... I guess these guys are the only ones who have made decent movies like that. I wonder if John Ashcroft has ever looked at one of them ...
