If I understood correctly, after the Chinese took Hong Kong, the famous Cat. 3 Hong Kong films have somehow disappeared. At least until now, and what an amazing movie this one. I knew it was a brutal police drama, but to be the first cat. 3 I bought what was done recently, I did not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian hitboy travels to Hong Kong to stun the wife of a judge, who is also a lawyer. It turns out that the judge made the necessary arrangements for the murderer because she divorced the judge and threatened to take all his money. All this is known in the first ten minutes, nothing is lost. After the coup, the police quickly found the killer, but trying to stop him, several policemen and civilians were killed. He escapes the police and the race is launched to catch him before he escapes to Cambodia. It's a film that never stops and barely gives the viewer time to catch his breath. Yes, it's very violent and intense, a lot of cops are killed, because the killer is very difficult to follow and kill when they locate him. Along the way, the killer trying to hide in a garbage dump finds a woman raped and abused by a man. He helps her and saves her from the guy, and she persuades the handyman to take her with him on his escape. I loved this film, it's like a roller coaster that keeps moving, one incident to another, and the police are sometimes as bad or worse than the perpetrator. The acting is exceptionally good and filming and photography are breathtaking. There is no break in this film, not even with the end very very incredible. The end is pretty much incredible, and also an appropriate ending to all the action and violence. Yes, the violence is sometimes brutal, but it is a criminal drama that will not disappoint you and that will make you crack. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a more widespread version, including an R1 version for sure. Excellent film, highly recommended.
