52-Pick Up has never had the respect he should have. It works on many levels, and has a complicated conspiracy that can be followed. The actors involved give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly molded and offer a deep representation of the characters. Also note Vanity, who should have seen a career as a serious actor given his unexpected abilities, and Kelly Preston, whose character will haunt you for a few days. Anyone who likes action combined with a complex and complicated story will appreciate that.
