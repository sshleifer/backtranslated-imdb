This electrifying musical has more than a puff of selfishness from its star, the musical genius that is Prince. The film takes about 90 minutes to pose, but in reality, it's easy to understand why it's such a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Like other films focusing on the struggling young musician trying to be great, this film has a hint of drama to add a dimension to musical numbers. Although this film is not as good as a recent example, it is nonetheless entertaining and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side, the story is centered on the Kid (Prince), a young artist and a regular at the clubs. The owner of the club is frustrated by the arrogance of the kid and he does not know he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival. On the side of the kid's parents who have problems, his father abused her violently. During the film, the kid learns some lessons from life and learns to enjoy his friends more. That's all we've seen in the teen dramas of course, but it comes together in a musical comedy, a very stylized musical comedy. <br /> <br /> The distribution is good. Prince is actually quite good on the dramatic side, when he does not pose. He seems human and relatable. Clarence Williams is also very good as an abusive father. Appollonia Kotero makes a good start as Princes' sexy lover interest. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film, however, is the superb soundtrack. The musical numbers are well staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical master, even if he is very eccentric. When he is inspired, he is great, but on the other hand, he will often perform songs that are only for his own taste. Sometimes, his experimentation may lack fire, but the same goes for many geniuses of music. The soundtrack of this film is excellent, only Sexshooter is a weak point. The exceptional performance of Purple Rain is remarkable. It's one of my favorite songs of all time. *** <br /> <br />
