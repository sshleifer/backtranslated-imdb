Sports movies have never been a thing to me, but a few of them work for me. The best are those who focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. It's an excellent directorial debut for Karyn Kusama and a first outstanding performance for Michelle Rodriguez. "Girlfight" is both realistic and engaging, enough to make it a memorable movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is advanced enough. Diana Guzman is in her fourth year of high school, but she is about to be deported because of her fights in the hallway. As a way to free her anger, she enrolls in boxing classes at the club where her brother trains (at the will of his father). <br /> <br /> In 90 minutes, we, viewers see something extraordinary. Diana almost literally goes from a girl to a woman. We see him as well in his body as in his behavior, especially when one of the boys of the club feels attracted to her and that she puts herself in it. There is not a bad scene or a lame / artificial moment in the film. I would say that the only mistake that can be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what appears to be an unfinished note. Apart from that, Girlfight is a great movie.
