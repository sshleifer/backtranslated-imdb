This is one of Sammo's best comedy films. This is not a parody of Entering the Dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and imitates him strangely for a man of his size. Nominal history about how his fights continue to cause problems to his loved ones - then to fight. Oh, the fighting. Good fast-paced, high-impact scenes (the white guy playing a boxer seems to be really hurt by one of Sammo's kicks). <br /> <br /> The funniest piece of this movie was purely involuntary. There is a guy looking for Jim Kelly (one of the three experts hired to eliminate Sammo), but he was a blackface Chinese with an afro wig. Come on, did not they have real blacks in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've also seen enough "Chinese" fake Christians in old American movies. <br /> <br /> This is one for all fans of Sammo or Bruce Lee.
