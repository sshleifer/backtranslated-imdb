I really wonder how this show is played in the UK and the rest of Europe. IT IS SO MUCH TO BE AN AMERICAN (especially white Americans). This could explain to a large extent the venom and vitriol expressed here. I like the show, but with some reservations and I feel that it is the easy solution of Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> Break everything and burn everything at the end of the second season. Julie has slammed the door open for any hope of relaunching the series unless her character falls on a haystack in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a funny, eccentric and sometimes scary show.
