It's a great Swedish movie .. it was the first Swedish movie I saw .. it's simple and deep .. what a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist made a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was a great inspiring friend who helped her to keep going and never give up. <br /> <br /> The fight between the conductor and the hypocritical priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him And defends the noble cause of Michael to help the inhabitants of his city to find his peace in music. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the end .. it was not so good but it has a deep meaning.
