I recently watched this film, a lazy Sunday afternoon, with a friend of mine and we have a lot of fun! This film is a masterpiece of the trash. Try to watch it with this lens! Of course, it was not planned, but the performance provided by the actors (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the low scenario and the low cost budget had created an amazing mix of crazy things. Tomba had just retired from alpine skiing, where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine Cup season titles of the world. Seriously about the director: nobody knows why Damiano Damiani signed this film. All the other directions of Damiani are considerable.
