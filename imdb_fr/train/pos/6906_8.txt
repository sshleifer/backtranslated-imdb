I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, cute, silly and entertaining. I had a beautiful casting and was hit by critics for reasons that I really do not understand. No, it was not "Grapes of Anger" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a nice movie. <br /> <br /> Julia was excellent in the role of "the man behind the man" psychotic. The story is a bit silly, but it's not a drama, guys. I happened to see a review of the film, probably the only good one he had, then meet one night while I was looking for a movie. I never heard that he was supposed to smell bad before he saw it and I'm glad I saw it. Finally, I bought the VHS tape on the bargain pile and I watch it several times a year.
