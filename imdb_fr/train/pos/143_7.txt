Riget II is a good sequel, but not as good as the first. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first. There is a lot more comedy in this film, but hey. <br /> <br /> We are back at the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish National Hospital. Mrs. Drusse is about to leave the hospital once her work is done, but fate does not. She's chasing the ghosts soon, and Helmer makes everyone lose their heads. The situation will soon worsen with the liberation of black powers in the kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story involves a lot more comedy than the previous one. It certainly means a lot of fun, but it makes the show a little less serious. The story has kept many elements of the last series and added new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just idiots, but they save it by turning it into a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> Actors are the same with some additions to regular distribution. They are all very good. It's a strange story and setting. Some parts are a total show and the characters change during the show, so staying serious and staying realistic is not an easy task. However, these actors manage perfectly this whole situation. <br /> <br /> Most of the qualities of the first series are preserved. Cinematography is one of those qualities. The portable camera that made the world famous Trier gives suspense and reality to the series. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and track characters and Trier uses these abilities. Good, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing makes it enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Get ready to see a better effect in this sequel than in the first. Prepare yourself to see more. I did not think this green stuff looked too good. I thought it was not original and did not fit. Nevertheless, effects like ghosts are really good. Non-digital effects also look good. Little brother looks really weird, but you accept it. Everywhere, I would say that the effects are good to good. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. Moody and nice. Some are really touching. It's going really well. As a first film, there is quite a bit of music in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> This gives a good result. If you had seen Riget, you will see this one without being disappointed. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this. These two are a series you do not want to miss.
