As a community theater actor who works hard but does not take action seriously, I am always amused by those who treat him as great art. This film pitilessly puts "The job of actor" while enjoying many good laughs. <br /> <br /> A ham actor on hand for a movie looks like a dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack due to excessive consumption of food and drink, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the "role of his life" of the neo-Nazi leader of the secret services. He plays it thoroughly, makes the girlfriend of the dictator fall in love, and conversely, and reverses nicely the roles of his captors. <br /> <br /> A lot of good shtick by the tracks, a lot of good work by unknown actors, especially the house staff and two members of the palace guard, and the small fun cameos abound. Sammy Davis Jr. makes fun of himself, Jonathan Winters plays another retired American businessman, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and especially Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> It's a silly movie, but there are many beautiful places (in Brazil), a humorous scenario and good actors who do their job and seem to have fun and not to go through the usual existential anxieties about what is only playing!
