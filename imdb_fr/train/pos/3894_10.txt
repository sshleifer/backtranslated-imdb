I wish I could laugh as much as when I saw this show for the first time. This has not been the case since. <br /> <br /> What is strange is that I laugh almost as hard after watching the series again and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, is moving, is a man of the world. He speaks skillfully of politics and yet does not feel the need to "engage" in a political discussion. He is above that. I would compare it to George Carlin, who uses his comedy to convince people of his ideas and does not seem to like the fact that he's trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The funniest guy in the world
