This film is excellent. <br /> <br /> Now, I tend to like my films loaded with history and dialogue, but from time to time, something like Moonwalker presents itself, and it's visible, despite many flaws. <Br/> <br /> This film is nothing more than a very entertaining advertisement for Michael Jackson. Beginning with the clumsy video of "Man in the Mirror", a montage of his accomplishments and bits of his career, he goes through all the ups and downs of his life before collapsing into a really entertaining segment. Fun video clip for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', which follows MJ's adventures as he races in front of manic fans of stop-motion, before dancing against a bunny suit. Stop motion is not so bad that some people would have you believe. It is passable. <br /> <br /> Then we see the beautiful video of "Leave me alone", and go directly to the foreground. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is laughable. Very laughable. We see Michael coming out of a building, then being shot by thousands of soldiers. We then made a flashback showing MJ and three children falling on an underground den. "Mr. Big" (Joe Pesci) is the naughty villain who has a plan to make every child in the world hooked on "drugs" (no details are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the girl with whom he finds himself are caught, then hunted ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really the important part. We have two very cool sequences in which MJ turns into a car, then into a robot-ship, and of course, the amazing "Smooth Criminal" sequence. <br /> <br /> It's an average film, but it's still fantastic for those who love MJ. He has most of his greatest hits, and some nice little songs, and some pretty good special effects (the Robot / Spaceship sequence in particular). It's really worth it, especially since you can get it for about a quarter of a month. eBay. This will keep the children silent for a few hours, as well as most of the 20 older people who were children on their first outing.
