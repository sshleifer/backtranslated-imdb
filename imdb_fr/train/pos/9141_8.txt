You can debate Prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this film. There is no debate about his musical talent either at the time or now. Twenty years later, it seems to be a dark shadow, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> After having experienced the hype of this film (graduated from high school in 1985), I can tell you that there was nothing greater at the time. Tipper Gore (Al's wife) was trying to censor "Little Nikki" and everything under the sun via the PMRC (Music Resource Center for Parents) until every "Air Band" at The time pretending to be Prince was the hottest thing. For a few weeks at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and we were so excited at the premiere. It did not disappoint. EVERYONE has been caught. I was MTV's junkie at the time (they were playing music so ... all the time) Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I must qualify this comment by saying that at that time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, The Gull of Seagulls and others of the punk / new wave genre. Prince's music at the time transcended all types and styles. One of the reasons some of them seem so old-fashioned and so contrite now is that it was SOOOOOOOO. All the things that remind you of the 80s were so iconic. It was common and it looks like a clich√© now. It has become so popular that it has become ridiculous. It's like Gry's rappy advertising for Wendy's Hamburgers. <br /> <br /> It seems stupid now, because EVERYONE was caught (unfortunately, like a weird purple macarena or something like that) Anyway, I hope that you gave a little insight.
