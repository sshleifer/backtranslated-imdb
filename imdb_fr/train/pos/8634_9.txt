LOVE IN THE TOP - the American title completely lost for the superb French film "The Mouton Enrage" (that is, The Rabid Sheep) - is a film so original that it dates from 1974 the most amazing. This film was way ahead of its time; even by the highest standards of today, he accomplishes things that seem rich and new. Filmed by the extremely underrated director Michel Deville, he defies the description to the extent that he combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into a very original mix - leaving an end for the end, but subtle, surprise to make all this went before suddenly suddenly sad and more understandable. The cast is splendid, ditto the writing and the theme. But it's the delicious tone of Deville, which keeps you constantly unbalanced but seduced, which pushes this film "lost" at a very high level. (The written interview with the director on the "Particularities" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have the time.)
