Fred Olen Ray, director of action, horror and science fiction movies, shows he has talent as a director. Actor William Smith is one of the toughest / toughest in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best impression of Lee Van Cleef. It is not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the film. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stands out. Ray did a great job in making this movie, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this B western on a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) a seven.
