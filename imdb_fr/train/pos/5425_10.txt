This is how Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a player from Bengal) and Douglas Fairbanks. Jr. gives great comic performances. However, I would like to note two other, less well understood elements of this masterpiece. The final sequence of the magnificent battle, while the marvelous Sam Jaffe painstakingly climbs to the top of the temple to blow up his bugle and warn the regiment, is simply magnificent. He never fails to fascinate me. Another underrated element of the film is Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as a guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but a neat, well-designed, articulate, historically informed villain ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He has defeated the armies left in India by India The Great"). Indeed, we can see parallels between this mystic, diabolical nationalist and some well-known figure of the thirties (a German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi flyer? Not enough. But still, an epic great, funny, moving.
