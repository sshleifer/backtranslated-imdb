Although it's a better movie than 101 Dalmations (real action, non-animated version), I think it's still a bit short of what Disney could do. It was well filmed, the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better realized (compared to 101). The acting game may have been better, but the human characters have been given much more appropriate roles in this sequel, and Glenn Close is not to be missed, as in the first movie. She makes him shine. His poor lackey and his overzealous furrier companions are wonderful characters to play, and they add to the show that Disney has given us. It's a great family film, with little or no shocking content, yet it's still fun and interesting for adults and kids alike. It will be a classic, as are so many Disney movies. Hoping that the third will be even better, because you know they probably want to make one. ;)
