I really enjoyed this film. The story goes back and forth long enough and is not easy to follow. The story has no resolution, and you have to wonder what really happened. Since I like this kind of movie, I liked it. I particularly like the scenes of "dating" between boys and I was drawn to their lives. And of course, any movie with a Staphane Naked Curtain will get a few extra points. ;-)
