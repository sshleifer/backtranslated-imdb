My babysitter was a fan, so I saw a lot of older episodes growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I do not know why I left the TV on during the first broadcast of this show. To my surprise, I found it nice. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * avoid tomatoes from other fans *, so I like that they focus only on those two. However, this could cause fans of the original series to hate it. I like dubbing, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I loved listening to him before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi seems, in my opinion, to really appreciate his acting. I also enjoy the technicians with their slightly autistic personalities and their desire to play Dungeons and Dragons or to play Star Wars scenes (which does not call their names in the series, of course).
