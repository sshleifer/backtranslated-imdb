Japanese film disturbed and graphically gore on little beings taking people to turn them into necroborget machines like zombie machines - who fight and hack each other so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this, a couple of lovers is infected. <br /> <br /> A technically superb horror comedy (?) Only for those with a strong stomach, blood and flying body parts. Good taste prevents me from describing what's going on here, but let's just say it's horrible. If you like this kind of thing with the form several steps above the slender content by all means see this movie. Personally, I'm not used to enjoying movies like this, but how sick and twisted they are. Here, I was intrigued enough to suggest it to people I know who love really bloody movies. It's also a movie with enough details so I want to see it again since I know what's going on. revealed at the end, I want to go back and see what I did not understand. There is a rare internal logic in these films. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 For those who love blood and sliced ​​limbs, it's a zero or more precisely a running alert for everyone else.
