Other reviews here seem to think it's a horrible movie. It's just not true and a bit unfair. <br /> <br /> The actors play is of good quality and the direction evolves with a decent fluidity. I do not think there is anything wrong with the way Tarantino-Esquire combines the stories with each other. Maybe it's just a new tool for administrators. I thought it made the movie a lot more interesting. Maybe some elements of the script need to be tightened, but that's pretty much the only flaw I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives an excellent performance as Sylvio, and Antonella Rios is breathtaking and only worth the price of admission.
