This film took me by surprise when he started at a cafe in Arizona and Richard Grieco (Rex), "Dead Easy", '04, decided to eat and it's all hot, from to annoy at the heat, sexy waitress. As Rex goes out of the cafe, he sees a state soldier and asks, "ARE YOU FAST?" and then all hell is unleashed in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill", '80, is a television journalist and is still looking for a newsletter to broadcast. Maggie finds herself in a hot tub and Rex asks him to tell him he wants a Western-style show, with the local policeman in town. It's a different film, however, Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors who helped this image TOGETHER!
