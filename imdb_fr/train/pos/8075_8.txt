I decided not to believe what famous movie critics say. Even though this film did not receive the best comments, this film made my day. It made me think. What a false world it is. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your closest fool you? It is said that no matter how often a milk snake is fed, it can never be loyal and will bite if it can. In the same way, some people are such that they are never grateful. This film shows how people can be selfish and how everyone is content to think about themselves and work for themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother dies inadvertently in the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we discover the futility of this world. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the execution of his life. The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. The actress who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. Her role was small but she portrayed her role so zealously that her performance moved her. Chawla had great facial expressions, but her role was very limited and she had no chance to express herself fully. <br /> <br /> A superb film by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give a message to the public. His films are like novels by Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist who has always had a goal and targets a social evil) because they have a real message to the public. They are entertaining and give lessons.
