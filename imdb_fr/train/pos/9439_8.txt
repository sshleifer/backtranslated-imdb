Before watching this movie, I had heard a lot about it and some scenes from the movie, but listening did not do it for me so I decided to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds are an interesting group of individuals dedicated to canoeing on the Cahulawassee River and the series of unfortunate events that affect them all. The development of the character takes a while to wrap the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but you will end up knowing these guys as if they were your friend. The acting game, the dialogue is very very real, as close as possible to the reality for Hollywood. Reynolds' character "Lewis" was interesting as a guy who is very hard but behind the manly veneer is hiding a man very tender and broken (his performance impressed me!) Jon Voight seems to be the most popular character. Honor, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him in every corner of the country really shape him and turn him into a different man at the end (the transition of his character was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem stupid idiots who like to joke and who do not seem to be too serious if they are not too, and they did it ... I'm really surprised by the vision of director Boorman from Dickey's novel, very impressed. You can not spend all your life without watching this movie. I give him eight stars out of ten, extremely impressed.
