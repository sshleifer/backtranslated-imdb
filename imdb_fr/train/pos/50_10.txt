It has happened that my children stop at this movie the other night and that everything begins to play, it really pique my interest. I had to go to the Bowling League so I would have them recorded for me on the DVD so I could watch the rest later. Well, I've just finished watching it and the front of my shirt has to be soaked after crying buckets. It was an excellent movie even though I could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing. And I would never have, in a million years, guessed the reason why Alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti-social goth. It was probably WHY my shirt was soaked because I had the same pain as Alissia. I too would not have looked for this movie, but I'm glad to have seen it. Very moving, very touching. Ideal for those who like a good drama or a tearful.
