Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is cruelly treated by her wicked stepmother and half-sisters. One day, a ball must be organized in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance to go, because his mother-in-law and his half-sisters do not leave him. With the help of her fairy godmother and her animal friends, she goes to the ball with the warning to go home at midnight. At the ball, she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes at midnight, she returns home leaving one of her glass slippers. With the help of his animal friends, his true identity is revealed. She and the prince get married later and they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a huge box office success and continues to appeal to the public. He has a well written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including "A dream is a dream that your heart makes", "So This Is Love", and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" help to tell the story. It was my favorite movie growing up, and it did not lose its charm. A real masterpiece of Disney! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent release on DVD is the best way to enjoy this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, old radio programs and a restored copy of the film!
