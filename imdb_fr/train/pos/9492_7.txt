This movie was nice but for the wrong reasons. The coordination of action sequences is laughable and gives the film moments of fun blunders. Close to the end, Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together, where Williamson tells Ginty, "You're sure you can avoid my buddy buddy!" I enjoyed this movie only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the plot that had to be written on the back of a towel in four lines and the rest most likely. A film of more than 30 parties has only a list of credits for a dozen people. It seems strange that no one has a credit in the movie. Maybe they had an idea of ​​the appearance of the finished product. The peculiarity of this film is that it is quite violent, which makes it tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty for a film that deserves a visit.
