I finally arranged for the DVD rental by mail order so I could find movies that are not available in the stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni and I also like small movies that are often ignored. <br /> <br /> This one is so nice! Meloni has such a charm in this part. It's easy to catch him if you only see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an unrelated mid-life person who jumps to the feet in many ways, only to find the way to happiness in an unexpected event. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not finished. I have not seen Busfield for thirty years and it was fun to watch. But that was all Chris's movie. I became a fan girl again. <br /> <br /> It's a bit slow at first, I'll admit it. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been edited down. But overall, this movie will delight you - man or woman - because it offers an honest and refreshing view of current relationships.
