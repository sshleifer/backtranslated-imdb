Inspired at least a little by Ivy Benson & Her All Girls Orchestra, who played throughout the war at the Covent Garden Opera, this film chronicles the attempts of an old saxophone to reform the group of girls with whom she played like a schoolgirl towards the end of the second world war. Short flashbacks on the original band on stage bring us wonderful music and help us to complete the context of the group members, and in particular the girls' relationships with the only male member - their travesty drummer (who tries out Ian Holm ( "The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench perform outstanding performances under the name of Widow Elizabeth, recently widowed, and the seductive wife Patrick, the drummer.The late Joan Sims is perfect as leader of the band, now playing the piano at the seaside, and June Whitfield shines as a Salvation Army trombone player Cameo's appearances by other big names such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make it an unforgettable experience.The film is a battle of memory, with a cast of stars that should, of all rights, be a group of extravagant actresses. I can say that I hope to look as good at their age! Leslie Caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years old. It certainly gives me more pulse! While I was watching her, I was mentally reprimanding the casting director for not using women of good age. After that, I looked at these girls and discovered that each of them is old enough to perform in London in 1944 (though this may be a little exaggerated for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like swing groups, love nostalgia, or just want to know how a woman can cope with almost three quarters of a century behind her, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
