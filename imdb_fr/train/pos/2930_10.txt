Eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the scene and makes funny the most basic thing ever: to go from a kid's ice cream to a long family tradition. The film is very rare in this country, but uncertain of its availability in other countries, I searched in many websites and still no luck. I phoned businesses looking for rare videos and year lists. SUCH ADVICE ARE VERY WELCOME. If anyone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees the video getting it, it's worth it and can not fool us.
