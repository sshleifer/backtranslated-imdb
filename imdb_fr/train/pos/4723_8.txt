Really appreciated this little movie. It is a moving film about the fight, the sacrifice and especially about the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays Miki is particularly good). There are so many large-scale impersonal films shot around the Second World War that this little story told in a convincing way is a real break from the norm, and even original. I will also add that this film is far from boring, very far! Of course, the horses are beautiful and the scenery is breathtaking. This movie is particularly rewarding for anyone who actually treats their pet family (as I do). Recommended for movie buffs looking for something different.
