It's a beautiful job. Very sexy and attractive plot to keep my interest all along. Its main disadvantage is that it seems to be done for television: full screen, and although there were several scenes of sex, there was absolutely no nudity (but, boy, it approached !). Strange too, since Netflix shows that it has been rated R. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, very moving and I wish that Alicia Silverstone make more movies like this one. <br /> <br /> A reviewer from Netflix said it was part of a series, but I was unable to know which series it was. I would like to know because this movie was so good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/23/2005
