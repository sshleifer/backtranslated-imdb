This masterful story is written by Pearl Buck in the top shelf of classic great books. The book as the film is called "The good earth". It tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the "Great House" where he took a slave woman named O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made it his own. wife. From the beginning she begins to adapt to her kindness by keeping a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. Over the next few years, O-Lan proved her worth by sharing with determination the work, the troubles and the changing fortunes of her husband. Over the years, they raise a family and observe their simple family climate, both a feast and a famine. Indeed, it is at the lowest point of their lives that everyone discovers the value of camaraderie, loyalty and love. With changing times, their growing family is helped and threatened by friends and relatives, such as their uncle (Walter Connolly) who is a scoundrel and charlatan, but who is tolerated with compassion. Wang has his "old father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise him and remind him of the fragile and unstable nature of life. Keye Luke, who plays Wang's eldest son, and Phillip Ahn, a nationalist soldier, are two outstanding actors who made an excellent impression in this film. The film is black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
