My Take: Use his familiar plot with great performances and some real moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is familiar. An innocent man is accused of a plot to assassinate the US president, the first traitor of the US secret service. While fellow secret service agents are pursuing him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course, we know his innocent, and the real culprit is close, but LE SENTINEL still entertained me. In this period when the thrillers are reduced to being too ridiculous and too abundant in the action sequences, THE SENTINEL is a good return on all the good old thrillers on political crime. The familiar plot is enhanced by thrilling sequences and breathtaking performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the ideal man for the post, is the long-time agent of the Pete Garrison Secret Service, accused of being part of a conspiracy. to assassinate the president. Former secret service colleagues (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing Harrison as he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor to the secret services. This leads to many chase scenes that, surprisingly (and thankfully), are never incredible. The screenplay also features a secondary plot involving Garrison having an affair with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, this was not useless, unlike most of the secondary intrigues of this type of film. <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.), who manages to give the film a beautiful appearance. Although many have criticized it as "should have been a TV movie", I am not of the same opinion. Okay, this is not a perfect movie, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigue like IN THE LINE OF FIRE or an episode of the TV series. 24 (to which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and starring Sutherland.), But even so, this film takes its plot to serious heights and does not give up even its smallest details. The performances are fantastic (with a first order distribution, it will necessarily be the case, even with the scenario with precise figures.) <br /> <br /> In total, I attribute *** 1/2, not Perfect, but not far from there. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5
