Some comments about this film say that it is bad and stupid and that an actor as excellent as Pierre Fresnay should not have accepted to play it. <br /> <br /> I think, on the contrary, that even if the film is strange and has weaknesses, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so great that it converts the film into something excellent. <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in his history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very controversial scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret. <br /> <br /> For someone who does not believe in a priest ?? even a defrocked ?? can convert it into the blood of Christ, the scene may be weird. But for someone who has been raised in a Catholic setting, it's very emotional, even if it's quite unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The scene of the death of the young priest is extremely shocking. But it's very well played. Pierre Fresnay transforms the act of mad murder into something understandable in the temporal madness of his character, the late Morand deflowering who, in this terrible way, resumes his duty.
