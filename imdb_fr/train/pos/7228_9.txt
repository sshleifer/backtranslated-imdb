The highlight of this film is undoubtedly the performance of Peter O'Toole. In turn madly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anyone do it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. What a beautiful face this man! <br /> <br /> The story is strange and quite unsettling and emotionally intense (especially towards the end), but it is also strangely touching and successful in many ways. However, I felt that the film revolved around Peter O'Toole's light performance and I'm sure I would not have appreciated it as much as if he had been in the film.
