Halloween is one of those movies that puts you on the skin! This is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman of all time! He was so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effect to say how computer-animated it was. It was a modest budget and a score of one note, but it managed to scare people. 25 years old and this movie still has the same effect as in 78. <br /> <br /> This is a boy, Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and escapes many years later to the psychiatric institution. . Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do everything to get him back, since he describes Michael as "... pure evil, the darkest eyes, the eyes of the devil". Michael is however on a mission, killing his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to keep the kids on Halloween, while her friends are partying and of course we know the rules, they understand them! But Laurie may have a chance because she's a virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween makes many tributes to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is a fantastic movie that breaks the boundaries and requires you to lock the doors, lock your windows and turn off the lights! "They'll have you! They'll have you!" Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
