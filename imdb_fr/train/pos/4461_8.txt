I really liked this movie. I saw several Gene Kelly movies and it's one of his best. I would actually put him above his most famous American in Paris. Sometimes, it seems that the story is lost in Gene Kelly's films for the benefit of the dance numbers and songs, but not in this film. It is definitely worth renting.
