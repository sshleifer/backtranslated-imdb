This film is a great non stop laugh incorporating all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - fluffy heroes, jester support characters, makeup dolls for heroines, villainous villains, puzzles, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a small dose Action. . <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda play the dual role of police and crooks. The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is in front of Govinda the cop. Heroines are simple accessories smothered in red. The crooks do not have heroines. Paresh Rawal carries his heinous act in DAUD (he played a similar gift to KHOOBSURAT as well). Asrani shines in a brief role. He makes a cover of his famous act of "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is impeccable as usual - as a humble and pious policeman, Pyaare Mohan and as a policeman, Chhote Miyaan. It imitates the Hindi style of Bihari with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, does nothing compared to him. But still, AB is fine. Madhuri Dixit makes a cameo like herself in the song "Makhna". She dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is great. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not look for LOGIC because it's a comedy and the scenario is quite convenient. Just have fun.
