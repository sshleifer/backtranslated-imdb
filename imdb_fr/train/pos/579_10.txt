In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near my home here in Provo, Utah, Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and it was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people did not like it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it was released on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after we saw the movie together. The film and the book touched a sore spot in my heart and I cried for several days after seeing the film. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones from hurting themselves. We see it in our own family relationships, but our love and our families and their stories endure over generations. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking - I was amazed by its beauty and the way it brought to life the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean: "But when I'm alone in the dim light of the canyon , all existence seems to blend into a being of my soul and memories, as well as the sounds of the Big Black Foot River, a four-beat rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. in one, and a river crosses The river was cut by the great flood of the world and flows on rocks from the base of time.On some rocks are timeless raindrops.Both the rocks are the words, and some of the words I'm haunted by the waters. "These words, taken from the book and uttered at the end of the film (by Robert Redford who recounts as Norman Maclean), are essentially scriptures, in my opinion. The eventual defects of the film are eclipsed by the beauty and grace of history and cinematography. It was beautiful!
