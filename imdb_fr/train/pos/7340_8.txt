This animation has a very good and simple conspiracy well against the evil and is all about the action. What sets it apart from other animations is the quality of the animation of human movements. It was really nice to see the escaped woman run from left to right on the screen and look around her, her movements were so well done. Why do not they use this rotoscopic technique nowadays? It's pretty effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in its prehistoric setting and scantily clad women, was clearly dedicated to showing the beautiful young lady in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving only as fictional. Some may hate it and consider it a weak male sexual fantasy, others (including many women) will love its aesthetic quality. I'm sure it did not bother me! Bakshi loves to enliven luscious and voluptuous girls, as can also be seen in Cool World, and I do not think he should blossom, because it's more about adult entertainment. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I had never forgotten it. This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime fare, and for that reason, it's worth the wait alone since it may be the best in Bakshi. For those who like activities with lush women: try Space Adventure Cobra too. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
