I stumbled upon (Act-I) by pure luck and it was more than ten years ago. It was not even what the cover label of the band mentioned. It surprised me. It intimidated me. It shocked me. I ended up forgetting, and almost a decade later, I thought about it again. Then went to buy both acts. They were even better than the ones I knew at first. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that, even though the tank police continue to fight to be at war against crime, armor and heavy artillery, it would seem like they're really struggling with criminals. This is never shown or is simply a lie, as they seem to take most of the time easy. If being in a state of war was really propaganda, it certainly was not presented as such. <br /> <br /> I do not think the original Japanese version could have been as good as the Americanized one. version of this. But as far as history is concerned, some appropriate explanations have certainly been lost, but we can apologize.
