This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father, Danny, invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about life. Girls go through life's troubles and have lessons in life. They develop crushes, boyfriends and much more. The whole show is essentially about to go with the stream. You do not have to keep a grudge, you just have to let him go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up watching this show and I still watch it today. I'm glad they are still broadcasting this show on television. I watch it almost every day. I note 10/10.
