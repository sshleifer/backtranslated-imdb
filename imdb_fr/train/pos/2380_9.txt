I did not mind walking. People were really walking places at the time. This gave an air of authenticity to this piece of time and a perspective on the technology of the Martians. I too was disappointed by the effects, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider one of the most exciting in the book. But I can not say enough good things about this film, for its loyalty to the Wells story! It's time The actors are nice and the performances are charming. This film is also worth seeing, just to listen to Jamie Hall's beautiful musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor playing both the writer and his brother in London.
