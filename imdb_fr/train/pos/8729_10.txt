The life of an insect is a very good feature film. This film is for young children, but it's also a great movie for people of my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He wreaked havoc in his colony when he destroyed the food for the top locusts. He is banned and he has to find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90s. The story is good, but a little more detail would suffice. The dubbing is good as with most animated movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned a nomination for one of the categories of music. Overall, this movie hit me. It's a good movie for all families. I note this movie 10/10.
