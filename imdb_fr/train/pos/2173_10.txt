It is often only after years that we can look back and see those stars that are really stars. As this French film critic, whose name escapes me, says, "There is no Garbo, there is no Dietrich, only Louise Brooks"; and there is thanks, my God! Louise Brooks! This is the third of his European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film to be, if not the, the first French speaking, for having followed a scenario written by the famous Ren√© Clair, for having been completed (the direction, for example) by Georg Pabst, and to have incorporated the voice of Edith Piaf before she was well known! So much talent working on and in a film, how could it not become a masterpiece ?! And that's what this movie is. It's unfortunate that Louise Brooks brushed Louise Brooks over when she came back to the United States - so many talents are so arrogantly bidding by the wayside! In the film, in addition to seeing Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see pictures of Paris in 1930 and to hear the young voice of Piaf. I do not get tired of this movie!
