"Life stinks" is a travesty of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white are always present in our lives. Mel Brooks' performance is brilliant, as always, and the work of other actors is also very good. This film has a little flavor of Capra, which is why it is so good. <br /> <br /> There are unforgettable gags like the one where Brooks tries to make money by dancing on the street, and all passersby Do not ignore him or meet a crazy man who thinks he is Paul Getty, then start arguing and slapping yourself. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you do not know what you are We missed. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and the reality is that this film has a happy ending and that the reality is not. <br /> <br /> Yes, indeed, Life Stinks.
