It is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village, which could be best described with scenes of constellations and the staging of ancient works by Kurosawa, associated with Dostoyevski's subjects on human psychology (Sonia Marmeladova), the drama of Shakespeare and that of Hans Christian Andersen. tragic and cheerful. The scenario is wonderful, the scenes are colorful and beautiful scenes remain etched in my memory. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a bit of action, so if you do not like all the feelings, you will feel the price -. These are not mysterious Geishas and proud Samurai with their Bushido, but life, work and the types of people they meet everywhere and at any time. A beautiful and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa, to see absolutely.
