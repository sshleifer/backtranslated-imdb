I really enjoyed this movie. He managed to do something that few movies do now; it brought me family values ​​while having fun. Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls. The little girls I was with enjoyed the film a lot and continued to talk about Nancy on the way out of the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think parents will be bored sitting at the theater. No, he will not win an Oscar and will not show wonderful special effects or even a scary mystery, but it bothers me and stays true to the spirit of the books. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with a girl (she will love it!) Or any fan of books. You will not be disappointed.
