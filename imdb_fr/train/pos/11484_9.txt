I just got back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day ... and I'm really surprised to find a negative comment on the film. Coccio is essentially responsible for the easy and exaggerated social message ... well, Mr. Critic, this is an easy and exaggerated criticism of social movies. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a school similar to those guys. Reject and ignorance on the menu. The thing is ... I understand how young kids can be pushed to do such a horror. High schools have become battlegrounds of conformity. It's really ugly. You must fight to be like others. It's hard to explain, but many people do not realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and smile at the fact that their life in their comfortable suburbs is perfect. <br /> <br /> The real motive of the film is not to know what motivates them. This is this quiet suburb like death and everyone closing their eyes and trying to create that perfect city atmosphere. Cal has expressed it well. It's a wake up call. Drama is everywhere and can take all forms. In this case, small dramas (like Andre being called a fagot to wear a shirt J.C Penny) are becoming the worst nightmare of any city. Andre & Cal used the most extreme way to express their pain. The discomfort of discordance at a time when it is necessary more than ever to be accepted like the others to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the last scenes where some guys burn Andre & Cal's crosses, as if with the pain they communicated, Cal & Andr√© communicated their blind rage to their community, their refusal to think about the causes of certain acts. <br /> <br /> This may seem aggressive as a film, but Coccio meditates more than moaning or uttering. What Andre and Cal live is a reality ... and a fear that could affect other children. <br /> <br /> Disturbing film ... The making of the house and the feeling of strength that reigns have made Ben Coccio a very very disturbing film.
