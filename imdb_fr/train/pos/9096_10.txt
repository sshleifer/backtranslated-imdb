Adorable! I saw Domestic Import in Philadelphia in October with my kids. We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. I have not heard them laugh like that for years! It was the first time I remembered seeing a movie my parents and kids could enjoy. It's really cute and we can not wait for it to be released on DVD. They have to make more movies like Domestic Import. It is refreshing to go in a movie that three different generations can enjoy (without being embarrassed). I have not seen such a cute movie since My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. She was also at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in the game and he is hilarious. I remember him from WKRP.
