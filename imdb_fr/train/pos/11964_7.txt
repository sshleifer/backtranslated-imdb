I went to the movies this afternoon hoping to be shocked by Scoop. Fortunately, the film has exceeded expectations, at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep - and not anywhere as good as a number of Allen's true masterpieces - but it's also completely enjoyable as a light and pleasant comedy. There is something simple and nice about it. "Cute" was the word I heard from the audience as it came out after the show. It does not seem that Allen has decided to create a masterpiece here, he rather wants to do a little comedy and have fun doing it. Compared to just about everything Hollywood produces, Allen's works tend to charm. Even the fluffy stuff. These days, it's refreshing to go into a movie made by a human being.
