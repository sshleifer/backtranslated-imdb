And yet another race in South Park is coming to an end. It was not an episode as powerful as I had hoped, but Night of the Living Homeless was a better finisher than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. He still can not move Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> Homelessness Night is a parody of the zombie genre, made in a way that only South Park could think of. of. Instead of flesh-eating zombies, the entities are homeless people who demand change and seem to survive. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked in the community center, although this time on the roof, where they can monitor the scene. A particularly fun time is when a member discovers that their house has disappeared and becomes homeless, which does not leave Randy the choice to shoot him down. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys begin to solve the problem, with entire story behind the takeover of the homeless trying to convey a message, but seriously uninspired. South Park is at its best most of the time when it is ridiculous. Matt and Trey did not criticize the homeless problem this week, but just smiled. <br /> <br /> The shock of the episode occurs when a scientist shoots himself in the back to try to avoid the homeless. This is the first time that a suicide in South Park is going badly, and we watch the poor man miss his brain, then try to kill himself several times as he dies painfully. Another moment inspired by South Park. <br /> <br /> Overall, this episode was funny, but it was kept in check by preventing any real comment on the homeless and staying true to the zombie shtick. The end is a bit funny, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> We must now wait for October for the next batch of episodes. It's a long journey, but South Park must be applauded for its management. The show seemed to run out of steam last season, but he is now back in top form.
