Albuquerque is a film that shows all the elements of a class A western, with one exception: the story that really belongs to a class B or C. It was acceptable at the time the film was shot, while people were so happy to see a movie. Western color, but nowadays it looks very primitive. Nevertheless, for fans of old westerns, it's fun, the original color and sound are very well preserved on the DVD just released. Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, Lon Chaney is mean as always and Randolph Scott is a bit more cheerful than usual. In a film called Albuquerque, you expect to see something that will remind you of the city, but the city shown here could be anywhere.
