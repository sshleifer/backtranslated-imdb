This is the second short film of Baby Burlesk to be published, and probably the most popular, is a parody of the 1926 silent film, What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I watched this and I do not understand the kiddie-porn it's claimed. It's just a cute little movie. I have seen family shows in which I grew up watching in the '80s and' 90s, with girls dressed in a more provocative and "mature" manner. It was more provocative because they did not wear diapers. A diaper is not provocative unless you have one of these fetishes. (Just a joke) I read this movie description and it says that only a pedophile would enjoy watching this. It's crazy. For me, if you look at this and it bothers you, then you may have to examine your own psyche and try to understand why it bothers you. It's an innocent film that has been made as a parody of another film. All of B.B.'s movies were parodies, nothing more. Today's parodies / parodies are graphic in nature and have real, almost pornographic scenes and a pretty mean language. These should not be more appalling? I can look at these without problems, but sometimes they take stories for children and turn them into dirt for these parodies. That should be in your skin. Not that they have babbled (not a word, I know) a 1926 adult film, because we know how dumb these movies were PORNOGRAPH, huh? Not to mention these movies "banned at the time of the Hollywood pre-code". They would never do such dirt today? (note the sarcasm)
