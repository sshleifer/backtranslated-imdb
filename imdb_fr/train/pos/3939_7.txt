According to John Ford's lyrical film, a fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life, his biggest flaws might have been a lack of sensuality in the woman and a dancing ability in the "worst way". Ford's camera has only glowing views to reveal about the early life of Mr. Lincoln. But for what is missing from the character, the complexity and depth of vision compensate. Unusually beautiful compositions from the beginning of the film, which could have been a series of beautiful still images, Ford has a unique eye to tell a story. The film sings the life of a young man full of hope. Henry Fonda plays Lincoln, one of his best roles, with his contemplative and spontaneously intelligent mind. <br /> <br /> The film concerns two brothers, brothers, who are tried for a murder they claim to have committed. In the classic style of the angry mob, the city decides to do justice and lynch the two, until honest Abe gets involved in the fray. He charms them with his humor, telling them not to steal his first big deal, and that they are as well lynched with him as the boy's lawyer. What follows seems to be the sketch of all the assassination dramas, as Abe quizzes the witnesses in front of the delight and humor of the judge, the jury and the city before tripping over the missing links. <br /> <br /> The movie unfolds like many of John Ford's movies do: a tablespoon of Americana, a hint of moderate predictability, a hint of sarcasm you're not sure if you've indicated the recipe or if Ford did it himself. Despite the film's overtly Hollywood atmosphere and overly patriotic jokes hinting at Lincoln's upcoming presidency, the movie is quite enjoyable and nicely constructed, so you can take your drama with a grain of salt.
