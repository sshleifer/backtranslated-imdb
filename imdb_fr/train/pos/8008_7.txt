As far as I know, this program was never rebroadcast on British television after its initial broadcast in the late '60s and early' 70s, and most episodes are now unfortunately "missing, presumed erased". <br /> <br /> Series 6 from 1971, however, it still exists in its entirety, and I recently had the chance to see everything, the best part of the last 4 decades. <br /> <br /> After coming home from home, Freewheelers was an essential viewing for me and many of my contemporaries back in those beautiful days of flared trousers, Slade and Chicory Tip. And watching him again caused nostalgia in his throat. <br /> <br /> Do not mind the bad / hammy game, unintentionally amusing fight scenes, blast holes large enough to allow a "frighteningly, frightfully" RADA accents from the main players. <br /> <br /> No - forget all that. Because Freewheelers is coming back to an old age (I dare say "gold") from the children's TV series, when the shows were just about entertainment and did not take themselves so seriously. Before becoming obsessed with all the "ishoos" charged with anguish that today's writers crack to their young protagonists, such as relationships, pregnancy, drugs, STIs, etc. <br /> Without doubt if it was to "redo a modern audience" in these politically correct days ubiquitous, the boss would be a black woman, one of the young heroes would be a Muslim, the other would be a young white man confused about his sexuality and the girl would be a beginning actor with an IQ out of the scales, which would forever remove the boys from their scratches and make them look stupid - in other words, to a million miles from Wendy Padbury's respectful upper puck for ankle sprains. <br /> <br /> It's a show that's really "of its time", but is it a bad thing? I do not think so.
