After reading the other reviews and lukewarm comments, I felt that I had to fight for this movie. <br /> <br /> Roeg movies tend to have little to do with each other and hope that this one will look like a movie you will probably like. <br /> <br /> The subject of this film is a thoughtful and irreproachable look at religious faith. The only other film of this kind - in terms of religious message - should be Tolkin's "The Rapture". <br /> <br /> I'm surprised someone can say that the story is confusing or supernatural. It's a simple film about the Catholic faith, miracles and redemption - even if you'll never guess it until the end. It's also the only movie I can think of that the resolution turns, literally, on a play on words. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic (thankfully) fallen, I know what the film is about, and I find some kind of tenderness in his ultimate innocence over the relationship between God and man. But if you are not familiar with the type of theology on which the film is based, it will move you over your head. <br /> <br /> As a film, as opposed to a story: "heaven in heaven", it is not revolutionary. While "The Rapture" is full of pictorial meaning and cinematic images, "Cold Heaven" minimizes its own cinematic qualities. There are no striking plans, no annoying effects, no attempts to adapt the content to the form. It's a work shot, but mastered. Nor does he have any dialogue or intervention to place him in a class of dramatic drama. It's a simple story that simply unfolds. It may seem strange. but in the end the mystery is revealed. This seems ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity disappears in a puff of Catholic dogma. <br /> <br /> In this respect, "Cold Heaven" has in its heart exactly the same kind of thing that drives a movie like "The Sting", "or" The Sixth Sense ", or" Final Descent ", or Polanski's "pure formality." These are all movies with a sleight of hand, they can frustrate you along the way, but they have one point - an obvious point, indeed - but the pleasure is, at least of all, to have been taken. <br /> <br /> Yet, even though it seems to be little more than a hairy dog ​​story with a typing line, it's worthwhile to watch how it leads and misdirects you, try it, especially if you are or have been a Catholic.
