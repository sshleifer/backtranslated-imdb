"The Lady From Shanghai" by Orson Welles does not have the brilliant screenplay of "Citizen Kane", for example, but the cinematography of Charles Lawton, Jr., the unforgettable scenes (such as the scene in the aquarium, the scene Rita Hayworth, a gorgeous blonde, singing "Please Do not Love Me" and the truly incredible climax of the Mirror Gallery), and the magnificent cast (Everett Sloane in her greatest performance, Welles in a magnificently sub-role) played, Mentue Hayworth - Welles's wife at the time - the most magnificent about it - is a memorable filming experience.The mysterious plot of murder is fun and compelling, not impenetrable at all. surprised by the twists, and the closing line of Welles is a new classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial referee.
