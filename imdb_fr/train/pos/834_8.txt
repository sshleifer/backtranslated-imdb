Black comedy? Gallows humor? How do you do a murder comedy? This can be risky because the viewer is forced to give up his moral values ​​and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people. Thus, the story must be rock solid with a good dose of suspended reality in order to make it work. Thus, Pierce Brosnan, the Irishman's answer to 007 is now portrayed as a chain-dependent and sex-dependent alcoholic who kills people for a living and is in a crisis of his life. He meets a troubled businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a difficult start, he learns that he needs a friend. But Greg is happy married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he does not have, love, home and life. Add Philip Baker Hall, actor of the character, as manager of the hit-boy and we go for the races. Brosnan is wonderfully rude and brutal as an anti-hero and Kinnear is as pretty as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a sparkling touch to Kinnear's very conventional wife, fascinated by this abandoned husband who interferes with their lives. The end is delicious and with a certain surprise. You should leave the theater thinking, at least in part, that you are good - if you are able to suspend your dread of killing people.
