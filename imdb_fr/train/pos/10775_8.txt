Beautiful movie with a great soundtrack that cuts through the rock landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (hometown of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film), describes the lives of young people and their problems related to the world. It reminds of Trainspotting, with an Italian touch.
