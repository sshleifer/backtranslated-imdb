I had no waiting; I had never heard of Jamie Foxx; All I knew was that the film has powerful actors. I thought it was very amusing. it was fun. The plot was different and quite unpredictable to hold my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is great (it's not his best role). I thought the lawsuits and fireworks had contributed to the film and were well done. I did not expect much and was pleasantly surprised.
