I looked for this one after watching "Clueless" (1995), a hilarious and linguistically stimulating film, perhaps Alicia Silverstone's best known effort since the beginning of his film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, which should be helpful to improve most movie projects. In fact, everyone in the distribution is doing a good job. The only disappointment that the film has for me is an embarrassing "feeling" for certain scenes, due to the need to present an uncompromising adult theme, as part of what, in tone, begins with a schoolgirl adventure. <Br /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is very good at this one. She carries the naive enthusiasm and growing uneasiness that Mary Giordano faces as she heads to the truth behind serial murder. I think his characterization of MG also has some mileage. The inference from this story is that she pursues a career in law enforcement. It might be very interesting for a former Silverstone to return to Giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows its director. Pat Verducci also has the credit for writing. I do not know of any other film work done by PV. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown support cast, although Bill Nunn (Inspector Jerry Guinn) is hardly that. Over the last decade, he seems to have managed to get an impressive number of appearances on the screen. I remember seeing it recently in "Carriers" (1998), a presentation made for television on a military theme. Bill Nunn has played "Captain Arends". Fans of the American TV series "Who's the Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers" because its main actor is Judith Light, many of whom are fondly remembered for her long involvement in the series. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" might not have worked, but it works. I think it's an entertaining story that deserves to be seen.
