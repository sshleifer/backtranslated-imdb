Micro-phonies is a classic short film by Stooge. The guys are incompetent repairmen working in a radio station, and during a walk in a broadcast booth, the perfect imitation of Curly's recording of "Voices of Spring" is confused with reality, leading to a radio contract and at a crazy musical party. . The simulated reproduction of the trio of the quintet of "Lucia de L'Amamore" is particularly amusing. This is definitely an essential viewing for Stooge fans. <br /> <br /> Although the signs of Curly's failing health are visible on her face and voice, her performance is amazing and this is probably the last glimpse of old Curly. Some fans think "A bird in the hand" is Curly's latest short film, but his hoarse voice and slow movement are just too hard to watch.
