This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist is actually more fun than any other because of the combat system (you hurt the enemy depending on how you control the attack, you can turn it into a dragon, the special attack , the magic ...) The script is very good. The characters are all adorable and you no longer have dialogues to support, as in several games in the Final Fintasy series. I got tired of dialogues about the past, when you want to continue with the story of the game. Ambition is a jewel of this game, it combines fantasy of the Middle Ages and futuristic science fiction. It is remarkable that the animation effects are just incredible, I like them more than other modern games (we can not remember that Legend of the Dragoon is 8 years old now). Then the map is huge, there are all kinds of places where enemies. Finally, music is not the best game I've heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
