I must admit that at first I did not expect anything good. I was just expecting a cheesy movie promoting the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I'm happy to say he has a lot more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is not terribly good, but it does not matter if all the actors are well disciplined and bring enough strength to their characters. The effects lack coherence, but the action scenes are sufficiently satisfying. <br /> <br /> What really appealed to me is the essence of the script. Even though it fuses fantastic elements, it also displays a raw reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and feelings really touched me and I think this is the key to this film. This makes you think and transmit all the anxieties. It meets all the expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
