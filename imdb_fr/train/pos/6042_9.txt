Running out of movies for rent, I bought Freebird. I struggled during the first third of the film wondering if the rest would be a waste to see. Fortunately, it really warmed up and I really liked the movie. The second half of the film made me smile and laugh all the time. Fortunately, although elements of CGI were included, they were not exaggerated or widespread. <br /> <br /> I must say however that the actors all have a strong European accent, so be warned if you have trouble understanding voice or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie and will have to order a copy for my own collection.
