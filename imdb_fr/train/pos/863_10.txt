I was totally absorbed by this film from the first to the last minute. It is brilliantly filmed, with many interesting and original camera techniques and angles. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is chosen by her friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, her true intention being to find love. She is a former prisoner and she takes advantage of him to take revenge on those who hurt her. In return, she must help with a robbery that requires her reading skills on the lips to succeed. The film turns into a dark film noir, with some really great scenes and an even better finale. The real beauty of this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the handicap of the main character. The use of sound keeps the tension constant and the spectacular passage from silence to noise allows the blood to continue to pump, that's for sure. Add to that a little black comedy and a shade of erotic sexual repression: you have the makings of a great movie. It's the kind of movie Hollywood really wants to do, but just can not.
