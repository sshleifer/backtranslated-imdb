I could very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the latest post that Up The Acedemy was well ahead of its time. The humor in the film itself is pure magazine MAD. I do not see why MAD is hiding behind this feature. It was also one of the few films of the early 80's to have a soundtrack that kills perfectly with punk and new wave bands emerging from LA at the time. I own the soundtrack and I play it constantly to this day. What can I say? There are definitely some worst movies. I do not consider that Porky is as funny as Up The Academy, there are very good laughs throughout the film, and the jokes fall in love with stereotypes or get fucked. Hey, nobody said it would be the Maltese falcon.
