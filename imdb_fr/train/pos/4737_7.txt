Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Of course, the plot has already been the subject of lawsuits and has already been heard (A biologically transformed soldier being part of an elite combat force composed of supermen who decides he thinks that killing and brute force are not the way to settle everything and become pacifist and librarian.But when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to find an antidote that will keep them alive by confronting the police (his best friend is a cop, he becomes the black mask). , very visual, works and at least for me is entertaining.I love martial arts movies that are spectacular.Fants flying lighter than air and recovering a fraction of a second after the impact maintain the rhythm and the But that's what it's all about in this movie, a showcase of Jet Li doing what it does best, and it's a spectacular demonstration of its talents, at least As with the plup art of fast-moving martial arts movies ala. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who are showing for the first time here in the United States, are not inspired by intrigue and incredible physical feats. But I have to say that even with the big holes left in the plot (like how do we see him safe in his apartment when there were only 20 men left with a trace of escape?). Who knows? The scene comes from cut it in the apartment ....... ohh well suspension of conviction I guess), the film for me remains interesting. It's only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to be a little shorter. But always around an awesome action movie.
