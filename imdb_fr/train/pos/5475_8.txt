Finally, the uncut version of "Baby Face" surfaced and from what source? The library of the congress. The four minutes restored, extracts here and there, give rise to a much better movie. We now know that Baby Face was pimped by his old man at the age of fourteen. Another reason to be for his behavior and his cold and calculating exterior. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of Lily Powers (notice the nickname), a part that called for a fair amount of sexuality covered with power, cunning and revenge, but full of pretension virginal when it is claimed, a representation very difficult to convince. Barbara Stanwyck brings the necessary nuances to show that, even if she sleeps to the top (literally), she always has a good heart - notice how she treats those who have been kind to her, like Chico (the wonderful actress). Theresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And although she exploits her sexuality to bring out rich and powerful men, these same men try to exploit her for her carnal desires, without intention of permanent bonds until they fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers does not understand, at first, that emotions are difficult to control, that it is easy to lose control. One of the possible outcomes is death. Of course, materialism can lead to a destination where there is only the ephemeral, and where it is cold and lonely. <br /> <br /> We must talk about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche whose power will be emphasized in "Baby Face" by the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly while she still turns to his old man. "Baby Face" came out the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is highly unlikely that the Hitlerite half-literate understood much about Nietzsche, he regarded himself as a Nietzschean and praised him alongside his other speeches. "Baby Face" serves as an impeachment of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's concept of power will, especially in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the cutest little baby face". is about "Baby Face" theme, an even more meaningful and applicable melody is WC Hand's "St. Louis Blues", throughout the film, especially when the camera has to move away from sexually explicit scenes. "St. Louis Blues" is also used judiciously towards the end, as Lily begins to see beyond materialism to embrace eternal values. Chico sings a crude and salacious version of "St. Louis Blues" when Lily, now disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her to stop. <br /> <br /> The restored version of "Baby Face" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude towards sex as a power, more than a new version of Hollywood. Watch this jewel of the distant past and enjoy it.
