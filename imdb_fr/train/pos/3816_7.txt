"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a Korean city of a province and the experiences of the main character interacting with them as a result of a horrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves from Seoul with her young son to Milyang City ("Secret Sunshine" in Chinese). She chose Milyang because her late husband (killed in a car accident) was born in this country and she believes she must make a new start in life in a new place. She does not respond well to the openings of local Christian fanatics, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and hunts these people as politely as possible. In fact, she sweeps at first almost everyone in Milyang, but some of them persist in wanting to invade her world and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more, it would be to give the film, but it should be noted that the role of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is prodigious. After reading that she won the best actress award in Cannes in 2007, I was expecting a decent job. But Ms. Jeon is captivating and you can not take her eyes off when she's on screen. The film is a kind of heartbreaking work inspired by Evelyn Waugh, showing how fate can feel crazy as strangely as inevitably.
