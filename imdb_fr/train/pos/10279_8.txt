Rich psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and regrets that her profession gives her the feeling that he is desperate to help his patients. A young gambling addict asks him to help him repay his debts if he really wants to help him improve. Here, she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. Revealing more of the plot would spoil a fun movie and "House of Games" could be the best scam movie I have ever seen. David Mamet has written and directed this jewel full of punchy dialogue, excellent one-liners and enough twists to let you guess until the end. Crouse is perfect as a stuck psychiatrist in need of a change and Mantegna overcomes her as a diabolically devious scoundrel. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the film, the film totally controls his audience. and we like the con. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
