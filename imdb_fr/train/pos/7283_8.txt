I love buying these cheap and ugly Alpha Video DVDs. One day, I happened to buy this one. It's the perfect silly sci-fi movie of the 50s, all sexual. Filled with ANY unscientific, lightly dressed girls and lots of melodrama, this is a nice movie, for those who appreciate this kind of stuff. And if you can "suspend enough disbelief", you can actually frighten yourself - not just by the psychotic head or the beating of the thing in the closet, but towards the end, with the character of "perfect body". It is so . . . . What is another word for the *** mind?
