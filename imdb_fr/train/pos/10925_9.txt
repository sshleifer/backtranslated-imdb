I really like this movie. I can watch it regularly and not get bored. I guess that's part of my criteria for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. He introduces us to 6 characters; each one has a very secret and deadly style of kung fu. Each of these characters is formed by the same master but their identities are kept secret. The dying master sends the sixth venom, his last pupil, to try to repair the wrongs he suspects of having committed with his pupils. <br /> <br /> How will the last student find the other venoms? How will he know which of them is bad? The way we answer these questions is one of the things that make this movie awesome. <br /> <br /> We can also see venoms fighting in all combinations. It's fun to see how their styles harmonize. <br /> <br /> If you want to know if you like kung-fu movies, it's a good movie to start. It's not better than that.
