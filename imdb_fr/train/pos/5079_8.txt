Well, first of all I would like to point out that Kaakha Kaakha is part of a Tamil prayer and is translated roughly as "protect". Khakhee, meanwhile, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> In addition, the Tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial projects, any film of Rajnikanth or Vijay would be a testament. to this statement. <br /> <br /> Kaakha Kaakha is now an EXCELLENT film with an excellent soundtrack. Certainly very surprising in the final scene, especially the love of the end (which is certainly unexpected!). The gore is a bit too much, but it's a very good movie!
