Well, I'm going to go against the tide on this film, it seems. Being an avowed horror fan, I sat at it, not knowing what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes, I found myself scared (quite rare). The film obviously has a small budget and is around the subway station, but the film's lack of money does not distract from the story. Yes, the story is a little far-fetched and can not be explained very well, but THE CREEP is a class action and continues to reduce and dismember everything that happens to it. MESSAGE FOR LADIES !!! THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THE MOVIE THAT YOU MUST CLOSE EYES AT LEAST CROSSING THE LEGS !! you will understand when you see him. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie and it changes to see a good scary movie slasher
