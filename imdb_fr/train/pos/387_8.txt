This film is good. This is not the best of CG kung fu movies, but it's pretty good. First of all, the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​the gods vs. the fallen gods versus the super powers is pretty cool. My problem is that there are too many characters! It was very confusing when they changed scene! The special effects were AMAZING! The fight scenes were very fast and complex. This film practically all generated by computer. The acting is superb, as always expected of such prestigious players. Ekin Cheng is an excellent protagonist and a lonely character. Zhang Ziyi did not do anything for me in this movie. I thought she would have a bigger role but she did a fight scene and a lot of yelps. The wicked, the whole army of the skull and the cloud of whole blood are very frightening. The music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series and not a movie. There is too much history to cover in 2 hours. Maybe if there was a book or something like that, I would be able to follow all the characters and the details. This film sacrifices the integrity of the story for action. I recommend Storm Riders for this every day.
