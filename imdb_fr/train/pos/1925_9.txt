It must be one of the best comedies on television at the moment. It takes the sweet and sweet idea of ​​a show that revolves around a close family and makes it a realistic and amusing representation of a typical family with gaiters, brothers, brothers, fathers too protective and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney! <br /> <br /> To his credit, "8 Simple Rules" knows it's a comedy and does not try to be more. Too many shows (for example, "Sister, Sister" and "Lizzie McGuire") think that because her main characters are now teenagers, they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humor by hitting too hard . This is a trap '8 simple rules' avoided; he tackles some problems (such as being excluded from school), but he has fun doing it. In fact, the only time it was really serious was understandable when he was tactful about the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think that although John Ritter will miss us a lot, he was the cause the show made his mark, "8 simple rules" can still do well if he remembers his humor and does not make Cate's father a second version of Paul Hennessy.
