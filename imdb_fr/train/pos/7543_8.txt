It is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. what a dialogue there is in the words baloons as in the manga. the plot of this is existing but only vaguely explained. there is a number of the manga on which it is based available in English in the blast book collection, "Comics underground japan", and it contains a subtitled dialogue that explains the plot a little more than here. I recommend you check this volume if you liked it, because that partly explains the "scenario" of the film, which is otherwise inexplicable. As far as animation is concerned, it's good use, good computer use and non-intrusive, and the images are mostly well done. he jumps in the episodes, while the characters, a cat and his old sister, a dead brain cat, wander in a series of strange images: a boat, a circus, a desert. for half an hour, they cover a number of half-scenes and sets, which leads me to believe that the director has chosen a number of numbers of the long-time manga to adapt to chance, but first and foremost visually. knowing what's going on could increase appreciation somewhat. It reminds me mostly of the kind of things they used to play in the MTV show, sushi cartoons, especially a short film in which a cat runs after the truncated cheek of a man around of the House. only in this case do the cats look more like Hello Kitty and their adventure is extended to death, reincarnation and a number of other themes (although not so easy to tell what's going on ). the dvd of it contains the comments of the director and a "making of", but I can not speak about it, because I did not contact them. I give this a 8/10 for now, here is not much to compare with the anime, and I hope more like that.
