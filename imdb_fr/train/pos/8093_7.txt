My friend had the idea to watch the animated LOTR after seeing the return of the King of Peter Jackson. So I finally bought it at e-bay, thinking from the start that it was going to be bad. In fact, it was not as bad as I thought. The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method to mix the live action with the animation to create interesting effects, and the guy who made the voice for Frodo looked a bit like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> Not the greatest adaptation of a book, but believe me, I saw a lot worse. It jumps a lot of points, since Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed in a two-hour movie. Definitely worth watching, kids might like, but still, absoutley no comparison with Peter Jackson's trilogy.
