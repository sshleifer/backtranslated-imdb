People tend to complain about the number of movies shot on the mentally handicapped. I do not see this as a valid criticism, nothing more than complaints of too many movies about people. Jaco van Dormael does a great job with the screenplay and the realization. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work together perfectly, Duquenne playing himself. The film covers an impressive number of events and is not content to return to what has been seen in "Rain Man". The end is rather depressing, but it does not spoil the wonderful story that preceded. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
