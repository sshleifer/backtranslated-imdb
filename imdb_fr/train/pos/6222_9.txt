It's really a good movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and Fred and Ginger's dances are among the best in their history. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's films are the same. Once the song and dance are over, it's the other characters in the movie that make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? Her romance with Harriet Hilliard and the film's subplot is why I watch it again and again. He adds to this film, it does not remove anything. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is in my list of the top ten favorites of all time. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a big actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. All of Fred and Ginger's films had secondary intrigues that depended on other actors to fill the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the film should be shortened by about half an hour. I just wish more people would like Randy and I felt the need to defend him.
