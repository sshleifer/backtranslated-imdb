Despite the other comments listed here, this is probably Dirty Harry's best film; A film that reflects - for better or for worse - the country's socio-political feelings during Reagan's glorious years in the early 80s. It's also a kickass action movie. <br /> <br /> Opening with a liberal woman, a judge who canceled a case of murder for lack of concrete evidence the famous line "Go ahead, make my day"), "Sudden Impact" is the a non-stop roller coaster of an action movie. You catch your breath for the first time when inspector Callahan, who is a problem, is sent back to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered man. It only gets better from there, with a group of grotesque thugs overflowing for Callahan, with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Superb direction, photographs and a sometimes hilarious storyline make this film one of the best of the 80s.
