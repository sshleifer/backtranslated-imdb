I just watched this 1954 movie with Vincent Price for the first time on Turner Classic Movies. Price describes Don Gallico, a magician / inventor driven to murder when his boss steals many of his magical inventions (as well as his wife, briefly interpreted by the charming Eva Gabor). Although Price is a murderer, I found myself supporting him, but he is a sympathetic character, driven crazy by people who are greedy for people around him and continue to enjoy it. Without having the "horror" factor of some of his most famous roles (like my favorite, "House of Wax"), he has enough to keep the interest of the viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of Vincent Price.
