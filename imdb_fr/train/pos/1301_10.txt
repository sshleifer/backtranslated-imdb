I loved all the work of Cream, even if there is a catalog of work as small and valuable to take in hand. Even when they play up to twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad Off of Wheels of Fire are eloquent examples), they still shake more than half of all current rock bands. This power to perform on stage is one of the most anticipated rock band rallies of all time with their concerts at the Royal Albert Hall last year. They may have aged, as well as their fans, but the energy is still there, with the great arrangements of the blues classics as well as theirs. The interpretations of White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love, not one seems to miss a beat. Clapton's solos have a formation he sometimes does not have when he's on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, enough said. Jack Bruce is strong enough with his voice always with a kind of power that Clapton could never get on his own. At the end of the day, if you want to see what are the best shows you would like to see last year (well, some may have seen them), it's all on this DVD, with some special cool features.
