Panic delivers the goods ten times with the Oscar-winning performances of William H. Macy, Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland. In a film about the choices we make and the consequences with which we live. Frankly honest and provocative, Panic is without a doubt one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in years. The impact stays with you right after you leave the theater.
