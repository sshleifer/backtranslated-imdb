Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title 'Come Undone', April 25, 26 and 27, 2001. The filmmaker uses techniques that enrich the story. Even with an autumn / winter background for the "present" and a spring summer for "flashbacks," it can be difficult to follow the continuity. <br /> <br /> Whether one or the other role is gay, the actors illustrate the nascent relationship. in real terms; from physical violence to each other to their passionate love. The story takes you into the characters a little slowly at first. But as we approach the end, you really care about where these guys will be next summer! You too will want a sequel to discover.
