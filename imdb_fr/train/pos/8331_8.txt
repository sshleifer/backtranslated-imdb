This film is a romantic comedy very relaxed and very pleasant to live. Meg Ryan does a very good job as a genius niece of Albert Einstein, although she believes in her own skills. Tim Robbins is doing as good a job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she enters her store with her fianc√© after her car has been force-fed. I loved Walter Matthau as one and only Albert Einstein. This film just has a very relaxing feeling, while keeping a certain gravity (if it is possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> Personally, I found this film extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - I found them fabulous and hilarious! This film seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a cheeky sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
