FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film of the golden age of SF cinema. Her sense of wonder makes her a great movie. As soon as the spaceship lands, the public - via the ship's human crew - goes through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure. We meet the unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair, and we learn more about the ancient inhabitants of the planet - the Krell that died overnight. Where did they go? <br /> <br /> It can be said that the planet is filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops, but that adds to the threat of claustraphobia and the electronic music of Bebe and Louis Barron adds even more atmosphere <br /> <br /> I'm shocked that this movie is not among the top 250 IMDB films.
