This story is a complex and wonderful story of the last harem of the Ottoman Empire. Well told and provocative, we see the workings of a bygone world and we learn more about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the story, the characters, the game and the scenes. Some scenes have suffered from rapid editing and the subtitles have sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise it is a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The main character Safiya is interpreted wonderfully by Marie Gillain, with whom I am happy to say that he did a fantastic job without doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and lovely. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something less Hollywood and authentic to the world they imitate.
