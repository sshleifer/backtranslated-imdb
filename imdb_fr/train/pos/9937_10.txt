This TV series was one I loved when I was a child. Although I see it now through the pink nostalgic glasses, I can always say that it was a quality show, very educational but always funny. I did not see the original French version, only Swedish. I have no idea of ​​the quality of dubbing, it was too long ago to be remembered. <br /> <br /> The principle of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear the school still has not taught me half of what I know about this show. It also has a connection with other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy foods and do not exercise, with beautiful examples in the body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that miniature virus tanks can invade you? : D The picture looked good, very good with the kids of course, but it's done with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon characters, giving you an idea of ​​what you expected in the animated body. <br /> <br /> This, and the story series (especially the ecologically scary finale) was an essential part of my childhood. I'm so glad to have found them here.
