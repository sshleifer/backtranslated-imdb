You use the IMDb. <br /> <br /> You have voted overwhelmingly for some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> This is something you like to do. <br /> <br /> And that's all because of that. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How not to give him a ten? I'm wondering to those who give this a seven or eight ... how exactly did THE FIRST FILM EVEN BE BETTER? For the record, the long opening shot remains an excellent sense of the show, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to the situation. And the dog on the bike is a nice touch. All this in less than fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often overused. <br /> <br /> He's a genius.
