I accidentally felt on this movie on TV, and I could not leave it .... It's really an excellent film that allows people to learn about America's history with the war of Vietnam, the time of the power of flowers, the fight of racism ... This illustrates the conflict of generation, political opinion, race that took place in the 60s ... I was born in 1980, so I did not know not all that before ... In France, the history of the United States is not a priority and this film really taught me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all the actors are great. especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this movie more than once a day !! It's really great .... what a pity it's only on TV, not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
