[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend for whom the idea that his parents have sex makes her terribly uncomfortable. It came to my mind as I pondered the public's response to "The Mother". <br /> <br /> People gasp when May (Anne Reid) writhes passionately in bed with her youngest lover, Darren (Daniel Craig), or later, sees sexually explicit drawings of May. I doubt that the public was impressed by the nudity or the content of the drawings as much as by the worry of seeing a woman of 60 years enjoying sex with rapture. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundrette", "My Son the Fanatic") proves once again why he is one of the most outspoken storytellers on either side of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to take. This burning family drama is not a film that you can appreciate, it's because it's raw, complex and often makes us very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it is powerfully a good thing. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michell (the director of "Notting Hill", of all things) create an unenthusiastic, heartbreaking and superbly interpreted portrayal of an older woman who realizes, after all. During these years, she can and must still enjoy all the pleasures of life. In a wonderfully epic moment, when her son, Bobby, asks him not to be difficult, May says, "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, indeed. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her tour in May. It's subtle, sober, powerful and sad, often at the same time. Observe Reid when May observes Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate pouch in a pub. Or when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous appointment. Reid's eyes and face reveal May's anguish and despair. At the most devastating moment of the movie, May kneels in front of Darren, ready for anything for him, just asking him to be nice. It is an extremely courageous performance of a remarkable actress. <br /> <br /> I appreciated Michell's use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots first arrived at Bobby's. This perfectly illustrates the cacophony around May and Toots, the casual way in which their own family welcomes them. <br /> <br /> This film has sometimes reminded me of the honesty and brutality of Mike Leigh's work, except "The Mother" has a slight sense of optimism to stay afloat. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene a pretty old-fashioned sensibility. The lovers remain unclear while in the foreground a white curtain floats gently in the breeze. And the only sound is that of May in the grip of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that Reid and Craig, who will completely embrace Darren's role, make their way so intrepid in these roles that it is unfair to hide the energy from the public. almost primitive of their characters. Especially since Michell does not hesitate to make visceral later sex scenes. <br /> <br /> This film does not have extremely nice characters. We sympathize with May, but she also hurts her daughter. But I doubt Kureishi wanted to tell his story to friendly people. I think his goal was to unmask a family that is already cracking when an emotionally cataclysmic event occurs. It is unshakeable in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.
