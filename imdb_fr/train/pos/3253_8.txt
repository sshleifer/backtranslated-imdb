This is not a film to be taken seriously, but a good little film anyway. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not just a piece of down. The acting game, IMO, is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those movies you would not want to see, but it brings a smile every time it goes on the cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
