I watched this movie without knowing anything about it and I found it thematically similar to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on a father-son relationship in difficulty. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father in the mines and dreams of a better life outside his hometown. Both sons face the mockery of their classmates and both have a strong female role model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The major difference I found between the movies was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching movie. Laura Dern performs a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well, as he did in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle staging, very different from his other feature films such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
