Why do people whine about this film and not such dreadful movies as The Godfather. Titanic is the biggest film of the 21st century. With great actors, directors, effects, music and in general, everything. This film is always rejected by everyone, because one day, someone said they did not like it anymore, so most people decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this film, not only the most Oscar-winning film, but also the most, is the most successful film ever made and one of the most underrated films I have never seen. Apart from that, it's really the best movie of all time. The only movies that look a lot like the Star Wars trilogy and The Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything from Hitchcock, Spielberg or Tim Burton. They are all good films and directors, but none correspond to James Cameron's Masterpiece TITANIC.
