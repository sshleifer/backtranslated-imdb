What would happen when a depressed police officer worked with a psychiatrist on probation? Perhaps a lot of fun ... This film is a reference in the action / comedy genre of Argentine cinema. Unbearable characters, a probable story and a rhythm that, between two bursts of laughter, gives thrills. I recommended it for a fun time. Peretti and Luque join forces to fight against a cold and daring enemy at a time when it is difficult to trust someone. This movie will surprise you, the other side of the room "Analyze me", but not the same, with nothing to envy. And if you like to know Bs.AS, there are only a few scenes of downtown and downtown.
