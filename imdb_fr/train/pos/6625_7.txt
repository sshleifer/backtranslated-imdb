If you've ever seen the movie trailer "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to see this movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance had revelators in the same way. <br /> <br /> The story of Renaissance is that of a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and a medical researcher. The decor is a futuristic Paris and elements of science fiction are present. The particularity of Renaissance is however its visual style and not its history. Renaissance is a 3D animation, like Final Fantasy, but very stylized in black and white with extremely sharp contrasts. The result is staggering (although the 3D animation problems of human beings are still noticeable from time to time: slightly robotic movements, slightly wooden face games, etc.). As a beautiful, highly stylized black film, Renaissance succeeds to surprise the public especially visually. The story and writing, however, are not quite the same level of quality as the visuals. This is not a bad story (and presumably, if you have not seen the trailer, it's a lot more exciting than for me). But it's a story that is not very original and bordering on the old-fashioned. A few lines of dialogue were painfully lame, making writing the sound of a beginner's first efforts. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend Renaissance to friends. It's nothing like what I've seen before, visually, and I think its originality makes it a rewarding experience. It's also a story to watch, even if it's not perfect.
