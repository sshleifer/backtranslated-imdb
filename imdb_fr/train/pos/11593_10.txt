I remembered seeing this movie when I was a kid one day in the wonderful world of Disney. This film has been in my memory for over 30 years and I was looking for it. I must say that among all the children's films I saw at the time, this one is more remarkable than all and after seeing it once, I really hoped to see it again. The story and images of this film have been engraved in my memory. To this day, I've never seen it after that day in the '70s. In fact, I've never remembered the title before an Internet search done earlier today reveals it to me. I loved it and I want my children to see it. Does anyone know where I can find it?
