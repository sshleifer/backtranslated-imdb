Ah, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are part of a wide variety of horror movies. This one contains a lot of them. Still, it's Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This movie was really good, too predictable. And what horror movie does not have stupid people? This one is overpopulated with delayed victims almost praying for their life to be taken. Pet Semetary, I found to be a little scary. The way everything is set up was really scary, but not terrifying. For the most part, the acting was CERTAINLY credible, the suspense was not so suspensive, but the level of entertainment is set at a major rank; My eyes were almost glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans should see this movie, but like everyone else, expect an OKAY thriller.
