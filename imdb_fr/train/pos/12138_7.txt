Several elements of this film date it immediately. The sound is quite sharp and you can see how much progress has been made in reproducing the sound in the following years. The language of the dialogue is rather picturesque and unnatural, and the actors' play is still reminiscent of its transition between stage techniques and theater. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a remarkable performance in all her films, as she did at that time. of his very successful career. I do think, however, that one way or another, Cockney's focus does not match facial expression. I think it's Cockney's supposed accent that does not ring true for me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan loves immersing himself in dramatic human relationships that will delight all movie buffs. As in many of her roles, Bette Davis can move from a beautiful, seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hate. Leslie Howard is a well-chosen actress as a retired clubfoot artist who desperately seeks out a partner and makes the wrong choice among an intriguing little waitress. <br /> <br /> Near the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street. They cross the traffic, completely unaware of the multitude of horns and whistles that scream at them. This scene may be meant to be funny, but I find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise serious film. It is probably designed to send you home with a smile on your face. And after all, as much as we can see (and hope), it's a happy ending.
