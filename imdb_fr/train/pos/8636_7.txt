A thriller with Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes for a road trip in the west of the country. This latter couple is looking for notorious murder sites for a forthcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on the lam (unbeknownst to Dave) and Juliet is his poor companion. It's a good cast and the story goes on, but Pitt is not really scary like a serial killer, although it's one of his best previous roles. The best thing to do here is Michelle Forbes, who always manages to shine, whether in her roles on "Homicide: Life on the Streets" or in the short series "Wonderland." <br /> <br /> Rating: 6
