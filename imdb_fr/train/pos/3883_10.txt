Until I saw this special show on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I'm happy to have it now! It's one of the funniest comics I've ever seen! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself as completely in his job as Eddie. I could not stop laughing during the whole show. If you like to laugh, you have to see this special!
