It was an extremely low budget (it seems that some scenes were recorded with a home video recorder). However, it has a good line of tracing and is easy to follow. Eight years after shooting her sexually abusive father-in-law, Amanda is released from psychiatric service, with the help of her doctor, with whom she has a secret affair. The doctor ends up renting a house for him and buying him a car. But in the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills him and buries him in his garden. Then she sees that her neighbor, Richard, looks at him and will stop at nothing before having it. She's innocent, but after another neighbor, Buzz discovers that Amanda killed that doctor and tried to kill his wife, Laurie, Richards (it was after he and Amanda went to the bath at tub). Then she stops acting so innocent and kills Buzz, then tries to kill Richard that she is supposed to love and care for. And you will have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Overall, it's a good movie that reminds me a lot of my life. You know that everything falls for the neighbor and you do not stop until you are part of it.
