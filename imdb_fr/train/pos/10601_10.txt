This very funny British comedy shows what could happen if a part of London, in this case Pimlico, declared itself independent of the rest of the United Kingdom and its laws, taxes and restrictions post-war. The happy chaos is what would happen. <br /> <br /> The explosion of a war bomb has uncovered ancient documents that show that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a small historical note long forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, without any interference from Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is excellent as a small town politician who suddenly finds himself at the head of one of the smallest nations in the world. Lady Margaret Rutherford is a delight as a history teacher alongside Pimlico. Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern are also part of the cast. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
