If this film had been a little better prepared, it would be with the best of Astaire and Rogers. In fact, it's a good film but too long with a tedious secondary plot, that is Randolph Scott's sister romancing Rogers, played by Harriet Hilliard (this is Ozzie Nelson's wife for you, boomers). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two men in the navy. Scott meets Hilliard for the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later after Ginger Rogers asks her friend (a blonde but undeniable Lucille Ball) to glorify her. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his former dance partner stopped. The result is great dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers as a team and separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket", "Let yourself go" and "I would rather run the band". Hilliard is sweet but a bit lethargic as a simple. Jane has become a glamorous girl, even though she sings both her songs, "But where are you?" and "Get me behind me, Satan" - a poster was not interested in this song, but I like the title. Rogers is alive, and a young Astaire is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film comes in the end with "Let's Face Music and Dance", one of the most painful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly performed by Rogers and Astaire. In this document, they embody the glamor and fantasy of the 30's. You really have to keep it and watch it again and again.
