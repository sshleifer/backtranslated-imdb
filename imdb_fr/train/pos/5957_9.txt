The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I'm not a movie critic and I will not behave like the rest of the snobs commenting on this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie did not have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great! It seemed like you all had a lot of fun doing this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was powerful on one channel instead of the two, but I guess it could have been a mistake when recording the DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check. other movies produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, the actors and the team, thank you!
