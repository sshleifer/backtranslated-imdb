This image was banned in American theaters in 1930 because of the nakedness of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann) who caused all kinds of problems in women in the 1930s but not so much in the male population. This story is about a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the wedding night. The husband never consumes marriage and is worried about all kinds of petty things such as shoes and murderers. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain his situation. On a hot summer day, Eva rides and decides to go for a swim in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs away and she runs after him and is watched by a young man who finds his clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people are very acquainted and there is a novel that is beginning to flourish. There are many other interesting issues that arise when you watch this movie to the end. Enjoy a great classic movie that was a Shocker movie in 1933. Enjoy.
