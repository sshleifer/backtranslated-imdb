One of the many musicals on sailors on leave is the usual sailor who meets a girl, complications ensue, a happy ending. It's going pretty well, but it's also lagging behind. The dialogue is not as lively as "Top Hat" for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are compensations. It contains some of Irving Berlin's best songs, including "Let Yourself Go", "I put all my eggs in one basket" and "Let's face music and dance". There are Fred and Ginger who, when they dance, take away any film with a heavenly height and they do not disappoint here. They do a tap dance, a comic dance and a graceful dance swirling in the same movie! Great versatility and artistic talent. <br /> <br /> We also need Harriet Hilliard who is quite talented in her role. She had a varied career, becoming the most famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here, she touches without being sentimental. His two songs are interpreted simply and effectively. She makes a good contrast with Ginger but we can believe that they are sisters in the film. <br /> <br /> Increased tightening has made the film even better. Very good anyway.
