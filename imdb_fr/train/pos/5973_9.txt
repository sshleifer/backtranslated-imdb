It's a ridiculous horror film that captures the essence of the mid-to-late-80s obsession with supposed metal music. I remember being scared by metal teens when I was a kid. It does not help that I found a desecrated grave in the cemetery of my hometown when I was ten years old. It turns out that this weird metal kid had dug up old bodies and used their bones in a strange sacrifice to satan. So maybe stuff like me deterred me from metal for a while, but I love it now, at 24 years old. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD at $ 6 and I expected it to be worthless because of the jacket, but to my surprise, he ruled. This is the extreme demonic power of metal. And you must love a scene in which a guitar pulls on lazers and sprays heads in the crowd. This movie is great, if you like 80s metal and bad movies, this one is for you. 9/10!
