I saw this movie yesterday on Turner and I could not stop watching until it was over, although I could guess what would happen. Farrell was excellent in his role and everyone did a great job. Some seemed to exceed the limits, but overall, I loved it !! If you have the chance to see it, please do it! In fact, I cried at a few scenes, but then I guess if you are a mother, you would do it. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just surprised at the idea that they were single moms, it seemed ahead of her time. I say, watch if you can, and do not listen to critics. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I really enjoyed that!
