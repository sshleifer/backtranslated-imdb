The family film is one of the little things often forgotten in this family film. <br /> <br /> At the time, in 1994, this film held the record for the biggest premiere in the film's history (and can continue to hold). It took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the "Angels" of the original movie that "haunted" the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake, they "haunt" the California Angels. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the first took place at the Three Rivers Stadium, former stadium disappeared, which housed at the time Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers (Pirates). are now housed in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field). The first took place on a five-story cinema screen in the stadium and held (and may even continue to hold) the record for the largest film premiere in history, presented to 60,000 viewers. Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd have all witnessed the admiration of thousands of sports fans.
