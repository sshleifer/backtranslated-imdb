Henry Hathaway was both daring and enthusiastic for his love of the first peoples of US history. However, criticizing the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormons is not necessary or useful for commenting on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway has achieved a superb direction that describes what a Mormon people were at the beginning of the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the period from the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of release of the film. In often subtle shots and dialogues, he covered Mormon philosophy and teachings in many segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this film several Saturday morning early in my youth. It was a little more than 10 years after the release of the film and before the completion of the Los Angeles Temple, which I saw was being built and which was inculcating more and more curious wonders in terms of to know who the Mormons were. I recently bought this film and I will appreciate the following messages that Hathaway has interpreted in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs. 2. Charity towards people in need or not. 3. The family is of the utmost importance. 4. Listen with respect and attention, because even the opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. Work hard, both individually and in community, 6. Prepare and store for the future days of need, 7. Hope is an imperative link with a higher being, and for our daily life, 8. And, that there is a unique quality group, and appreciate those who are identified as beneficial.
