I recently bought the very underrated Dreamcast and went to town to find games to use. I bought Soul Calibur (A Classic) and then went through the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and I played Res Evil 3 many times, and I was impressed by all of them. The No. 1, which must remain in the story, has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them 3 approaches the dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If it's just to buy a dreamcast for this game, it's worth your time and effort, I've never been so excited about a video game the way it has fascinated me. <br /> <br />, the story continues from the second story in which Claire Redfield looks for her brother (Chris - from the first story), who is presumed missing under the plot of the dreaded umbrella company. We know little about this society except that you have destroyed these people three times in previous stories. <br /> <br /> To help Claire, with Super Kid's assistant Steve, you need to unlock the truth of your brother's real location. The 2nd CD allows you to control Chris, that is to say if you manage to go so far without leaving the room with fear. <br /> <br /> The control is very fluid and the movement of the characters is beautifully realistic, when the character notices a danger, he / she faces the direction from which it comes. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave this game 10/10 because it's simply the game of the year, the game of the decade and the best game in the world! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
