When his DVD came out, I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was on the right track, as I expected before buying it. Awesome movie, what else can I say for Will Smith? He was a great actor, as always, whether in action movies or serious movies. It still gives a record braking performance. I think it's the film after August Rush that makes someone cry by looking at her. The way the director described the story was really great. His previous life and new life in the cinema have been well developed for the public. Even I could not find any fault in the story or in the way they pulled it. I think his DVD should be a household because it will be really good for your collection. It's not the movie that needs popcorn for fun, it's the film that lets the audience learn a lesson. now what is the lesson you can see while watching. And I advise those who are film critics, watch this video if you could find reviews about this movie, so please, talk to me.
