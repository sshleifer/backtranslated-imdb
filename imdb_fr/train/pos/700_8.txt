An insomniac nightmare was an incredibly interesting and well done movie. I loved the way it throws you into the subconscious of the main character without pampering the viewer ... the acting was excellent - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan read the repertoire! - But everyone, especially the girl, was great too. I was also very impressed by the look of the film. Usually, "independent films" have a grainy appearance, but this director knows what she's doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I can not wait to see a feature film by Tess Nanavati!
