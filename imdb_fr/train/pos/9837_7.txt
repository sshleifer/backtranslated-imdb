Zombie 3 has an interesting story in its making. First, it's a continuation of Fulci's Zombi 2 hit, Zombie 2 being a marketing ploy, of course, to fool people into believing it was a sequel to Dawn of the Dead. George A. Romero, also known as Zombi. Pretty confusing? Basically, none of the films are related to each other, but we do not care if they make money. I guess Fulci himself started making fun of the Zombie 3 production when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei was invited to participate in the shooting of the film with additional scenes to extend the duration of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot of Zombie 3 is what you have to do to buy a zombie. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal and unleash a plague, and a zombie is unleashed. Scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is ready to knock everything out without prejudice. There are also brief excerpts from a radio DJ preaching about how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this movie. I have heard horrible things, but I find the wacky dialogue very pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, the corruption of the army, the man who plays God, etc. I feel like it was a serious movie at one point, but it deviated in a strange direction, presumably when Mattei arrived on board. . <br /> <br /> In addition to ripping off other zombie movies, it was very evocative of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the radio DJ announce the good news with: "When you see the men in white suits and gas masks, run to them for help." This is of course played with images of men in white shooting zombies. Later, they directly steal a scene from Crazies in which one of the regular and uncontaminated people is killed by mistake. <br /> <br /> The gore factor is pretty good in this scene with hordes of zombies at every corner. How cool is it? Let me count the means ?? 1. Birth of Zombie 2. Zombie Head in Flight 3. Birds of Zombies. 4. Zombie without legs swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the maniac at the service station handling machetes. He was mean and almost destroyed the whole building while trying to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote ?? When a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, scientists ask him, "Do not you think that once the ashes are in the air, they will fall to the ground and contaminate everything?" To which the sergeant answers boldly: "Now, you speak of science-fiction." He also continues to mention the "science fiction" told by scientists even in the end when everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, Trailers and Interviews, especially the one with Mattei where he insists he directed 40% of the scenes, but do not know which ones or any other important details. <br /> <br /> Net result: A must for fans of zombies and Fulci. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
