Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a beautiful story that inspires others too. <br /> <br /> The action was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later because of her performance in the film. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accident has delayed and hurt the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger accident is approaching. I knew one of the Challenger astronauts intermittently from my childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus, where my dad was going to school; I also know a close friend of the deceased driver. <br /> <br /> Last year, I did the technical review of the National BSA of the Astronomy Award for Scouting and I still think that Spacecamp is an excellent film to recommend to I teach merit badges related to space. <br /> <br /> I came across the astronaut who died as an adult and I was following an engineering training schedule we had when Challenger exploded. I found myself by chance with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", returning by chance to the events that followed the accident at the meeting of the shareholders of Astrotech. So I am much closer to the accident and all the similarities between the films. I made sure I was a good student and graduated four years later, which is quite odd, on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and who then built Endeavor.
