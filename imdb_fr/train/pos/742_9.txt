The coming of age films is quite common nowadays. For 1980, "Foxes" really gives meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character right away. Since she made "Taxi Driver" four years ago, she has a stronger character in this film. It is Jeanie, a high school girl who has a lot of courage and who seems to leave any situation in which she is. Scott Baio plays Brad well before Chachi in "Happy Days". He is judged immature by the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanging with the bad crowd, pursued by her police father. Jeanie and her other three friends decide to live in the wild until they move into a rented house where a party becomes totally out of control. Exploring life on the other side of the slopes can be fun or dangerous. Annie is saved by Jeanie and Brad all the time when she is wasted. The reality comes back hard when she is killed in a car accident. And we are getting married to a much older man. Growing up is not easy, we have sometimes had to explore life as it is. In reality, you must pay attention to the people around you. For me, I was my own person and I tend to stay that way! Super music, super intrigue, this movie is a jewel! 4 out of 5 stars!
