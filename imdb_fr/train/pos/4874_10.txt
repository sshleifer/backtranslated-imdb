Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of its own landmark, with a frantic pace and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! Music is ubiquitous, as are filming, animals, crazy bastards, sex and incredible gadgets and inventions, everything is colorful to entertain only. Pure cinema by essence. A wonderful experience to watch. And we are especially grateful because good comedies are so rare and so wonderful. Here's one, and if you liked Kusturica's previous films, you'll love it, though, as in all comedies, it's a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood to do it.
