It's a tongue-in-cheek film from the beginning with a voice-over that mocks everything French and then produces a rather naïve but courageous hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Incarnated by the splendid Gerard Philippe, this dashing young man firmly believes in destiny while fantasy that Lollobrigida predicts - especially that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo soon discovers that she too is in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Powered by good sword fighting, cavalcades and other action sequences inspired, the film advances at a steady pace and with many comics moments. The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so light and takes itself so little seriously that I could not give a second thought to these shortcomings. Do not miss Noel Roquevert, a heavy heavyweight traditional French film, who tries to steal La Lollo, embarrassing himself, and fueling the script as a fortune teller who reads the hand of La Lollo! And what a jewel Marcel Herrand is King Louis XV, megalomaniac and impulsive! That's not all: so many beautiful women in a film make me wish to be in France and on the set in 1952! The film may have been released that year, but his verve, his cheek, his superb story, his immaculate photograph and the memorable Gérard Philippe make it modern and enjoyable to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, let alone anyone who loves movies in general and the musics in particular! Go see him!
