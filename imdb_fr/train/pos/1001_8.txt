A somewhat funny and fast-paced action thriller that introduces Jamie Foxx as an unlucky and fast thug who is chosen by a US Treasury officer (David Morse) too demanding to be released on the streets of New York in search of a thief Difficult computer / hacker (Doug Hutchinson), who stole forty-two million dollars in cash and left two guards slaughtered. <br /> <br /> "Bait" marks the second part of the film Antoine Fuqua ("The replacement killers") manages the task quite well even if he does not reach his first film. What the two films have in common are the action sequences, which are excellent. <br /> <br /> Foxx is very good here although his character is annoying at first, but throughout the film I started to take on. Hutchinson is wonderful as a brain who can be ruthless like John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in "Marathon Man". Morse is fine as an agent who offers the ingenious plan to get the culprit at all costs.
