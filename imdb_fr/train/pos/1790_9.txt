I love this film and it's such a beautiful example of a family danger, a romantic love story and a sad scenario. Everything was so perfect and excellent about this movie. It was such a good mix of actors and actresses and with a few laughs and a lot of shouting, this movie deserves to have many awards. With the mention of beautiful script, and although I link this film to The Notebook and The Family Stone, he was kind of a lot more cunning, sad, and brilliant than those films. The Evening tells a love story between an old woman who dreamed of finding her youth and her two daughters who stay by her side when she is not doing well. The story of this story is so strong and wonderful that I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You get to know all the characters and in the end, I wanted to see everything again. This is an incredibly sad and extremely played and planted movie that is truly unique and should be seen by everyone just how wonderful it is. All the performances are amazing and the film captures your attention from the beginning and never lets up. I loved it and I'm so happy to have watched it because it was really an amazing film ...
