I had the TV on for a companion of white noise and heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment". So I fell in the TV room and was expecting another movie from the 70s and I had a lot more. Fortunately, I could go back to the beginning (DVR buffer) and press the record button to view it all the way (uncut cinemax and in HD no less!) Apart from a few holes in history and improbable intermittent dialogues / events it's an effective way. thriller worthy of your time to watch. Quite scary and progressive at times: the character of Beverly D'Angelo masturbates in front of Alison Parker, deftly interpreted by Cristina Raines, Parker stabs, very bloody way, his father, an explanatory trio scene. (Do not let children watch) The film contains TOTALLY 70 years, with bad clothes (polyester costumes and sticky ascents) and a decor, bad hair, a voluminous score and a familiar cinematography. The distribution is excellent, take a second on the home page of this movie to watch it. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles - always wonderfully scary! ENJOY!
