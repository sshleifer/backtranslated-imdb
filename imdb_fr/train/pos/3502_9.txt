Wow! I loved this movie and I LOVE Judy Marte !! This girl is not only a pretty face, she is funny and really very talented !! She made me laugh a few times just by being very naturally brutal with Victor desperately dragging her! We'll see her a lot in the next few years ... and probably also director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Very refreshing! It's true, nice, funny, well filmed, it has everything to please: good story, good actors, good direction of film! <br /> <br /> If you like slow, simple movies, real life, urban movies, like maybe Jersey Girl Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! It's better!
