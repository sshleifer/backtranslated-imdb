It is by accident that I swept the TV channels and found this beautiful film about two beautiful human beings who have drawn towards each other in a very innocent and pristine way. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 Television Series (Nicole). This girl and this guy will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and that you really wanted to follow your heart with a guy or girl that you love deeply and whose trace over the years. Jesse and Celine have a very good conversation and a deep eye contact with a big magnetic explosion between them. I look forward to the SEQUEL of this movie in 2004 and if you watched this movie, you will feel the same.
