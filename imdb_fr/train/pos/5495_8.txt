One of the best documentaries published in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, his support coming mainly from the poorest regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup d'état briefly deposed Chavez. At the time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas to make a documentary about Chavez for British television. Their film deconstructs the coup and its consequences and electrically records the story that takes place on the spot, inside and outside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. The goal of Chavez was to free Venezuela from free market policies imposed by the United States. Although Venezuelan oil already belongs to the state, it was exploited for private purposes by leaders that Chavez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. The world's fourth-largest oil supplier, Venezuela remains inundated with poverty and its resources are literally being extirpated by foreign multinationals. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins by describing the first years of Chavez's presidency before the coup d'état. It emphasizes its popularity among the poor and its various policies that have proven successful among working-class people (education plans, distribution of oil revenues, basic democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a strong supporter of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. This naturally made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private television channels quickly began to oppose the public television channel. They questioned Chavez's motives, reason and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without the support of the media, the coup d'état would not have succeeded. The film clearly shows that coups are heavily reliant on the media to disseminate information and that information can easily be fabricated. <br /> <br /> 10. Under cover of the "restoration of democracy", the opposition silenced the public television channel, dissolved the National Electoral Council, the Supreme Court of the National Assembly and took the control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. Interest groups, supported by the military elite (encouraged by the United States and the CIA), organized a civic march on the presidential palace to carry out the coup d'etat . Snipers shot at Chávez supporters, but private news channels published footage, so it appeared that the shots were aimed at the opposition march, which had in fact was diverted without risk. <br /> 12. The police launched a shooting attack on Chavez supporters, further bloodying the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, a prisoner, refused to resign. Of course, the media / government later lied, claiming that he had resigned, but Chavez's cabinet members passed on the truth to the international community, which eventually sent the message back to Venezuela by cable. The citizens rose to pressure the return of the president they had elected, only a referendum could replace constitutionally. 8.9 / 10 - At a little over an hour, this document is much too short. Nevertheless, it is a captivating journal that deals with a form of "media warfare" that is rarely mentioned. Makes a great companion to "The Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
