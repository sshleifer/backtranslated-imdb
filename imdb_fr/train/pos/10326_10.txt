We talk so often about cinema landmarks - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, a film is too often neglected by "serious" critics. Of course I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (MB) <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, it also seriously explores the question of the exploitation of developing countries by US imperialism. Not to mention kung fu. <br /> <br /> He also has the biggest soundtrack in the film's history (until, of course, Queen's breathtaking work on Flash Gordon). This film certainly deserves a certain rarity, but it will make the effort of your research multiplied by ten.
