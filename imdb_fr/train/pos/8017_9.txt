After having failed miserably to produce it, they all separated and separated. I love characters and cameos. The songs from the movie are "Together again", "Look at me, here I am", "Say goodbye", "And I will always love you", "Rat Jazz" and "It will make me happy" ". Frank Oz makes this film brilliantly and all the actors do a great job of acting as if the Muppets were real.See it! 91 minutes.Rated G.My rating: A.
