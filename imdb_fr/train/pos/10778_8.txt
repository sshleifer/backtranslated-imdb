Now, this series looks like most other series of the same genre dating from the mid-1990s, but the only thing about it is that it's different, they use a lot of comedy and action in that- this and maybe a little drama. as well. Personally, I thought it was a good show, I do not understand why they would cancel it. The good news is that the fan base of this series is still alive since 1997. <br /> <br /> I hope the WB brings back the series or even makes a film, which I know , go impossible to do, but hey it does not hurt to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would recommend not having seen it to find the DVD of 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the scenarios are good, the comedy is good and well the whole show is awesome.
