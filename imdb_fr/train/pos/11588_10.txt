This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy leaves with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the boy must feed and care for the eagle until he is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. the boy saves the eagle of death and fled the tribe. The eagle helps him feed him by catching a duck in a small pond that he scares. Later, the boy pulls on a deer that a bully child claimed because their arrows were very close to the same. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually caught the deer. But it was unfortunate, because it made the other boys even more cruel and in the end, he was pursued on a cliff, but when you think he will fall, his pure love for the eagle turns him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was. Please, if anyone knows where I can buy this movie, please let me know. I have not seen it for over 30 years, but I still remember parts of the film.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
