It was the second in the series of 6 classic Tarzan films starring Johnny Weismuller in the lead role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. <br /> <br /> As usual, it was a wonderful film in this series; and stands out perhaps as an "intermediate" film in a progression that could almost illustrate the development of cinema from the early thirties to the forties. As such, it shows a good pace, but not as good as the following movies. Similarly, cinematography is less accomplished than subsequent Tarzan films in this series. The stock I saw was of uneven quality, containing granular landscapes and underexposed and overexposed scenes. The precise display of Tarzan's latest films is lacking here. On the other side, there is a scene very early in which the jerking motion of a camera with foliage waving in front of him as the camera recoiled, showing safari men driving into the jungle, were almost modern in style and strongly contrast with the still shots that make up the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, an interesting feature here is Jane's almost inconstancy and inconstancy, while she was subject to flirting Martin. The kiss ?? and Jane is stunned and partly guilty, reaction ?? prefigure something of Jane that we see in the future as well in these films. Compare, for example, in Tarzan Find a son! The duplicate actions of Jane deceiving Tarzan and delivering Boy to his family. Later, she confesses to Tarzan that she was wrong. Here, nothing more explicit, but we have Jane "returning" to the Jane Parker of yesteryear, and in a series of almost repentant acts, stripping off the evening gown brought by Martin and Harry away from Tarzan . <Br/> <br /> There is a whole series of representations and sequences that struck me particularly in this view. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the picture we get of the domestic life of Tarzan is here, as later, a combination of sensual idyll with always the possibility of near a violent death. For me, this is at the heart of the Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by some pretty violent scenes, even by today's standards. <br /> <br /> There was a whole series of scenes that made me particularly happy: Tarzan driving elephants in the valley of the elephant cemetery; Tarzan being saved from death by water by the hippo, then healed by the monkeys; The cheetah will find Tarzan when Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; Cheetah in particular crossing the river on the newspaper. The final battle scenes of savages and lions on the ground and wild and great apes in the trees. Jane, showing us that she is truly part of the world of Tarzan, quickly displays her enterprising woodwork to draw a line of fire to drive away the lions. <br /> <br /> The last series of scenes is splendid: suddenly, Tarzan becomes On the spot, throwing wild in the trees, taking care of the lions and calling the elephants to the rescue! This last cry of Tarzan in triumph, holding a happy Jane in his arms, a cheetah dancing and delighted next door, is a memorable image and is really a beautiful summary of the story of Tarzan and Jane. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is another wonderful Tarzan classic movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
