With a minimal budget, eight minutes and a great imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has directed one of the most moving short films I have ever seen. The subtlety of the scenario is really remarkable, because it does not reveal the end before the very last moment. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you what the short film is about, you'll be able to enjoy a lot more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: directing, writing and playing in this amazing short film is the most remarkable effort I have ever seen in years. Also pay attention to the performances of Marta Belenguer, her reactions are incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
