Not to mention the best performance of Pierce Brosnon. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always excellent. Really, when was he really mean? I think this movie is incredibly underrated! The use of colors in this film is something very different in the current cinematic world where all other films have the blue Payback filter. I also like the way they used the Asian song. Prove that even what was once considered a little nerdy can be really cool placed correctly. <br /> <br /> I was doing my first feature film when it came out. Since my film was a hit movie, I had to check everything out of the genre. After seeing it, I'm sure it has had an effect on me throughout the process. When my movie arrived on IMDb, it was pretty cool that this movie is recommended if you like mine. Regardless of what others say, I have no idea, making it a more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
