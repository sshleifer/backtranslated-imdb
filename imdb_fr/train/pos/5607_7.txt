Once I looked at the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. He uses many of the tropes of the genre: the sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, apparitions, mysteries, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed surrounded by perverse and secret forces trying to drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> The last time I looked at it, I challenged that initial interpretation. If this film is a horror movie, it's just a horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is a horror. In fact, this film can be understood literally as a lonely man who slowly becomes crazy without any outside influence. <br /> <br /> In his career, Polanski has made three films about madness: Repulsion, which I do not know particularly. as because the development of madness in heroin has never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces; and The Tenant, which is perhaps the best paranoia study ever done in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who rents an apartment in which a woman committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with her and slowly begins to become one: he wears his clothes, puts on makeup, and speaks like her. But is he possessed by a spirit, or does he simply let his overflowing imagination take the best of himself? It is this hesitation between the real and the imaginary, and that Polanski never solves, which makes this film a fascinating film. Many film events can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can to normal causes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although it's not my favorite Polanski movie, it's nevertheless a good example of its ability to create suspense and present folly in very convincing terms. And technically, it's a wonder too. In other words, he collaborates with the film composer Philippe Sarde and the legendary director of photography Sven Nykvist (DP Bergman) to the realization of this film. A slow rhythm and sometimes uninteresting segments can make this movie difficult to appreciate, but it's still an experience.
