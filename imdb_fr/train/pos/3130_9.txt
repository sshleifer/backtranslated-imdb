I am Belgian and I grew up in the sixties. Most American series have been broadcast here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I liked. Unfortunately here, it caused a "panic hysteria" among the mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Well, compare the innocence of this series to the shit that kids can see nowadays. So, because of my overprotective mother of the 60s, I only had the chance to see two or three episodes! I was so frustrated that I started collecting comics and bubblegum cards (which I always had!) To compensate. I even had the View Master slides ... I wanted to see the crusader. All children need some sort of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally had the chance to see reruns as a teenager and enjoyed it a lot. The idiot game would have escaped me when I would have looked at it child, but I understood it at the age of 17 years. Yes, I've watched them all now and the nice, casual soul on the internet episode posts because they did not release the series on DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> Tonight I liked "Back to Bats Cave" ... it was a pleasure to watch because it was filled with trivia and inside jokes. Seeing Adam and Burt was a delight and this TV movie is just fantastic in every way. They play themselves as they played their roles in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "treat" ... I'll watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE IT !!! To rent !!! Lend it to a friend !!! Buy it !!! I would never expect that I rate 9/10 ... very well done!
