Barbara Stanwyck gives this first soap made by Universal, made by Douglas Sirk, the kick he needs. Not as memorable as Sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see by watching "All I Desire" where Sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years. Stanwyck is a show girl who returns to her family in the small American city, having abandoned her ten years earlier. His family and community have mixed feelings about his shocking return. Part of the cinematography is amazing, and Stanwyck is tough and really gives this movie a shot of energy. Overall, a pretty good show.
