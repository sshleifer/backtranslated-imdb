My choice for the best film has always been Laughton's "The Night of the Hunter", which remains superb in my cannon. But, it may have been replaced by "Shower," which is the most artistically Taoist film I've seen. How to care for others is represented by the flow of water, and the way in which water can be inspired, comforted, cleansed, etc., is the essence of Dao. It is arguable that the NOFTH and Shower themes are similar, and that Lillian Gish, in the first case, represents the purest form of Christianity, just as public bathers are the purest form of Taoism. I do not wish to dispute such an interpretation. Both films are visual joys in the integration of the idea and the image. Yet, Shower presents such a bleak vision of the sanctity of everyday life that I give it a nod. I venerate both.
