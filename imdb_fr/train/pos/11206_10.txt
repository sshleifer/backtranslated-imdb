I did not see this movie! At least not in its entirety. I saw some haunting clips that left me gagging to see everything. A sequence remains in my memory to this day. A spaceship (very convincing) turns around the dark side of the moon. The pilot releases a flash to photograph the surface hidden beneath him. The moon is flashing in visibility. . . . and for a few seconds, that's it. Parallel lines, squares, could it be ... then the light fades and the brief glimpse of ... what has disappeared and it is time for the probe to return to Earth. Wonderful. I have also seen other clips, but I would LOVE to get the full movie.
