Okay, so he's absolutely brilliant. But you must be smart and quick to understand his humor. It covers (attack?) All kinds of topics, such as the first landing on the moon, Easter / Christmas, disguise, movies and Herr Doktor Heimlich. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are opposed to not for you. While some of us punctuate commas and points, he uses the word-word. Also, if you can not laugh at yourself, never look at this; you will feel silly. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I watched his other films and I even saw him playing live, and this is by far his best work. It simply shines. <br /> <br /> Which could go so far as to say that he is glorious.
