It's a well-made film by John Cromwell who was not a great director but made some really good films, including the 1937 version of "The Prsoner of Zenda". Located in a London that only Hollywood can handle, atmospheric but has nothing to do with reality, it's a story of obsession and upset love, taken from Somerset Maughan's novel. <br /> <br /> I could not wait to see him. on DVD as I had never seen before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis, I wanted to see her in a role considered one of her greatest debuts. So I bought it. Well, she looked good, but I'm sorry to say that her London accent made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest movie actors, make no mistake, but here she did one. It was impossible to take his character seriously. It was not as horrible as Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent 'Mary Poppins' but close. <br /> <br /> The other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. Supporting actors are doing well. To watch despite Ms. Davis' vocal gymnastics.
