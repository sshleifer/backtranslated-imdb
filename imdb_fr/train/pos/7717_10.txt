I loved this movie all my life. It's a story as smart, with many classic allusions. for example. The ship that had disappeared a few decades ago was called Bellerophon. Well, in classical mythology, it was the man who killed the Chimera, a legendary beast of two or more other creatures. In FP, Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera and his id monster. <br /> <br /> I like movies where screenwriters have clearly attributed to their audience a minimum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbuster movies that spend $ 150 million in special effects, but about $ 1.50 in scenario. <br /> <br /> See you soon
