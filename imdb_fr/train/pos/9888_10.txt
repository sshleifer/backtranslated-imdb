Although this beautiful work of art uses some of the cinematographic vocabulary of surrealism, it is in fact not one. It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico's post-Columbian odyssey, as evidenced by a glance at the history of Mexico. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Like water like chocolate", "Erendira" expects the viewer to know it at least halfway, so understanding requires a little bit of job. (A good starting point is to see the character of Spanish grandmother: proud, distant, sad and above all weighed down by the story.) <br /> <br /> The ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because that the "result" of history (the present) is always obscure, because we are too close for an honest evaluation. The director has no choice but to refuse to carefully adjust the details, given the ambitions of the film. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is beautiful. A big-screen experience would be ideal if you can watch it in an art house or a local university projection. But otherwise, the VHS is better than never seeing it at all.
