In recent times, a lot of poo is coming out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> A friend sends me movies from time to time, surprise: it's great. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and I could not stop looking, it was a drama, but with a strange twist. Imagine if Romeo, as in Shakepeare, had a great power. It's sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take note of the new Russian cinema, they tell stories that do not concern big explosions and CGI. It takes a simple basic principle and tells a story without a show. It looks a lot like an Asian movie with a dark Russian touch. Admittedly, it's not perfect, but nothing ever is. You know what power is but it is never explained, nor fully realized until the end. It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. I do not want to see a remake, it is too cool as it is, the Hollywood system would, as usual, spoil everything. Play is top all around. The realization and the work of the camera are well above most of the crap that exists. Congratulations to everyone involved and I will let many people talk about this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find it, look at it.
