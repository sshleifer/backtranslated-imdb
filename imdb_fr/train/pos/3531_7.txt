Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this movie starring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does it, I might add, without a lot of help from his male actors, that is, Curtis and Tone. It's Raines, a pretty, long-legged actress who, for one reason or another, has never attained the status of some of her "black" counterparts. <br /> <br /> Siodmak uses sex, light, shadows and truly remarkable music when approaching this genre. Shadows, light effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the film is set in a nightclub with a very sexual battery riff of Elisha Cook, stimulated by an excited Raines. It is this scene that brings the "ghost lady" to a new territory. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to this material is matched only by Raines, who gives a sincere performance as a loving woman trying to save her man. Franchot Tone phoned this one. Alan Curtis did not seem upset by the fact that he could die and did not seem happy to live. And he never seemed to be in love with Raines, except for a brief moment in prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about many of these films is that as World War II progressed, psychiatry intensified. But often, the terms were used badly in such films as "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The greatest show on Earth". Thomas is described as paranoid. Tone probably has paranoia related to his disorder, but he seems to be closer to a psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by his headaches, he may have a brain tumor. <br /> <br /> The Ghost Lady does not have the biggest plot, but it's worth watching.
