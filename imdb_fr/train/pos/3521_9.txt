Other critics have summed up this film noir. I just wanted to add to "Whew!" commentary by a commentator about the battery episode presented by Elisha Cook. It was a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved praise for his frenetic performance. <br /> <br /> A detail on which I guess: Cook appeared as a waiter in the movie "Ball of Fire" by Barbara Stanwyck (1941). He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara sang and legendary drummer Gene Krupa played drums with boundless energy. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's percussion in the latest film, "Phantom Lady", was inspired by Krupa's work, as Cook testified three years ago? <br /> <br /> If you look at Krupa in "Ball of Fire", I think you will notice clearly similar body movements. We hope of course that HE was not influenced by any drugs at that time!
