We must first take into account the filming period of this film. 1995. The rappers were there and that added to the charm of this one. <br /> <br /> Remy was a socially awkward teenager who was trying to find his way and could not, until he met and was befriended by the Nazis. They welcomed him. The Nazis are not so clumsy, but like most gangs, they fill a void they lack, be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was a star on the circuit, with a questionable work ethic and a flea on the shoulder. He was still trying to feel sorry for him and his situation, and was asking his girlfriend and his teacher to straighten him up. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a white girl who was trying to find herself and was trying to integrate until she was raped. She then discovered her sexuality and political involvement. <br /> <br /> This film is about racism and, like most things about racism, people's own perspective comes into play. <br /> <br /> I've read so many comments about the fact that there were no black characters "diabolical", but that there was a diabolical white (Nazis). So what? Remy was not described as an evil at all, he was trying to make his way and failed until skinheads accepted it. He was scared, it was sad to see him evolve as he had done. He even said just before killing himself, I did not mean that, I wanted to be an engineer. <br /> <br /> Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men, Ice Cube was a bit of an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just described as a silly thug. They both showed no consideration for their roommates, and generally seem to dislike whites very much. They were angry like the Nazis but not at the Nazi level in terms of general malice. Sorry if that sounds unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. <br /> <br /> People say that the white color = -bad black = good. That's not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just lost. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed, angry and inconsiderate characters. Although their constant harassment by the police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in also seemed to justify his anger. <br /> <br /> Good movie, congratulations. Like all films that deal with racism, it's a great discussion project. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cube and Busta could beat these Nazis.
