A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski behaves well as the discreet introvert who strives to adapt to his lugubrious housing in Paris and his co-tenants. Horrifying at first because of his tenants apparently evil and self-obsessed and horrible later, as he develops his defenses, which will end up being his loss. Personally, I could have done without the element of disguise, but I accept the pseudonym of Psycho and the fact that there is some logic, keeping in mind the scenario. Nevertheless, it could have worked without and removed the slightly theatrical element, but it might have been wanted because the court certainly seems like a theater in the end. I can not help thinking that the director does not feel like a "real" French and Jewish. There is still a lot to enjoy here, including Isabelle Adjani's beautiful performance looking great and the good old Shelly Winters still reliable.
