Joan Fontaine is "A Damsel in Distress" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot, what there is, concerns a British woman (Fountain) in love with an American, confused with Astaire, a star of the musical. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful music from Gershwin, including "A great job if you can get it" and "A day of fog". The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a gambling house. <br /> <br /> Astaire's sung voice seems more robust in this film than in others, and he has two excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his best publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She is hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily have used a double because he was showing the dance in a long shot and was going through the trees. I would have thought it was a double, except that the dance was so ugly. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit, despite its flaws.
