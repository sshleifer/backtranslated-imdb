The name of Hayao Miyazaki has gained importance with Spitied Away. However, the first efforts of the director are often neglected. Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or that George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this film - almost certainly the last 45 minutes at the end of the 80s and what kept me in mind was the visual richness of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well known store for Â£ 9, I could not resist but I bought it. What is strange is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not fit my memory (the memory is fun that way). <br /> <br /> This film, with all the knowledge acquired on the portfolio of artists, is very similar to Jean 'Moebius' Giraud. I can only take some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), her adventure really begins - Laputa's quest - a reference to the neglected part of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. With healthy references to Jules Verne, it is a basic film against evil and hunting, the last part being the one where the heroes meet on Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the strongest part of my memory: the "pastoral". Ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered with moss under the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the film - the views of Laputa's surface, as opposed to the underground mechanics. <br /> <br /> Even if it is the dichotomy of this film - to show that even technology can not defeat nature - the irony of the last robot dealing with the garden and animals. The end of Silent Running is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It's incredibly elegant, I would not say "slippery" - very beautiful and organic and a huge amount of detail in buildings, airships and the design and appearance of almost everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and cherish it.
