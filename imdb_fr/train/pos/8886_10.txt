I was not alive in the 60s, so I can not guarantee that this film was a very accurate representation of the period, but it is certainly a moving and rewarding experience. There are excellent performances, including Josh Hamilton (With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich, an actor who has long been ignored by many, gives a breathtaking performance as a strict father, forced to question his own beliefs and values, because one of his sons makes him proud on his way to Vietnam, but coming back empty. inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. In summary, it is a powerful and comforting film that I hope everyone will have the chance to live it.
