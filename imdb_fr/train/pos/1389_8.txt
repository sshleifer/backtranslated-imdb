The Williams family lives on a ranch in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in a situation of considerable danger when the place is suddenly plunged into a temporal vortex where past, present and future meet in an extremely chaotic and unpredictable way. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on an irresistibly mysterious note and slowly makes things stranger, crazier and more exciting as the story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with abundant visual effects and manages to create a real sense of respect and wonder. The admirably candid acting of a casting game is considered another major asset: Jim Davis as generous patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone in his merry wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as Richard concerned, Marcy Lafferty in as long as his beautiful wife Beth, Natasha Ryan in sweet Jenny and Scott C. Kolden in the role of Steve. Awesome special effects offer a mix of thorny miniatures, stop-motion animation monsters (among the creatures mentioned, a tiny, hairless guy, a big, lumpy, crinkly beast and a skinny lizard guy) and stunning matte paintings. Richard Band's catchy orchestral score is really thrilling. The bright and sunny cinematography of John Arthur Morrill is also the case. A funny movie.
