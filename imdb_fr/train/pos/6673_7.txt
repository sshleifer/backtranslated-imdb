Most of the user reviews I've seen on the IMDB for this movie do not really do it justice. First, let me say that this film should not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be a funny, but stupid movie, that does not need to think, but only to appreciate it. If you watch this film with the intention of seeing a masterpiece either in filmmaking or in humor, you will be deeply disappointed. However, if you just want to watch a wacky movie with talented actors / actresses and some good phrases describing the situation, you'll appreciate it.
