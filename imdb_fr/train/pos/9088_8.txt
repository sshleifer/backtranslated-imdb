When we talk about Hollywood Hotel, we could talk about one of three things: the current hotel, the radio show, and this partially inspired movie of the first two. Dick Powell was the host of the Hollywood Hotel program on the CBS radio channel, where Louella Parsons aired the weekly celebrity scoop. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons launched the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934; its fair share of the radio audience. Powell animated, sang and parade with Louella and his guests of movie stars. With the power she had with her column, she was able to convince the various stars to continue to plug their latest movies for nothing. <br /> <br /> The American Federation of Radio Artists then intervened and asked him to pay a salary. as a result and they won the lawsuit. This ends the program of Hollywood hotels in 1938. Of course, Powell and Louella then turned to other radio stations. The entire story is described in Tony Thomas's book, The Movies Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before we unplugged, this movie came out of Powell's Warner Brothers home studio, inspired by the radio program. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the group Benny Goodman who gets a contract in Hollywood. But when he arrives in Hollywood, he finds himself entangled in a selfish movie star, Lola Lane, to his double sister, real life, Rosemary Lane, and to a ham actor in Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is called to sing in an epic of the civil war he's making with Lola Lane, it's Powell's voice they use. Then Mowbray develops a problem with Lina Lamont when asked to participate in the Hollywood Hotel radio show aired from Hollywood Hotel. This has the studio in all its states. Suppose the problem is not resolved as it is now, but Powell's director, Ted Healy, is very resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer provide a beautiful score for the film. The hit song is at the very beginning, when the group Benny Goodman and Johnnie Davis sing the Hollywood anthem, Hooray for Hollywood. My favorite though is Powell and Rosemary Lane singing, I'm like a fish out of the water. Listening to Johnny Mercer's words about Ginger Rogers directing the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without his fan, this is a digest of American popular culture of the 30s. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley does the choreography here and while the film He does not have the explosive imagination of his previous work with Warner Brothers, the numbers are well staged. The highlight of Berkeley is in a restaurant where you can go by car where Powell and Healy were forced to take jobs. The number starts with Benny Goodman broadcasting from the Hollywood Hotel and doing that a lesson for you, then at the drive-in Powell, Lane and all the place begin to join the song to exasperate its owner, Edgar Kennedy . And you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy's exasperation. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman explains why he was named King of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xylophonist Lionel Hampton were part of the band. That with Frances Langford singing too. And maybe the last surviving band member was a guy who had a small role as a radio announcer. He died in 2004, but not until he became the 40th President of the United States. Ronald Reagan has always credited Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as the two types of Warner Brothers that have been most useful for an enthusiastic young player who wants to make his mark. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood Hotel is a charming and entertaining establishment. film, dated, but charming.
