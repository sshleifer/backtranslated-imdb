I loved that this film recognizes the viewer's intelligence, allowing the layers to stand out from the characters through their mutual interactions on the tacit loss that has affected them so much. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is beautiful and reflects the vision of someone who, in my opinion, is a new extremely talented filmmaker, with the maturity and artistic insight necessary to tell a story others with much more experience have failed. accomplish. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who has the ability to focus on one goal and achieve it with integrity. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on this achievement.
