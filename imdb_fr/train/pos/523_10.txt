Why is this film not one of the top 250? This film still looks surprisingly fresh 56 years after its production, but it could not be realized until after W. W. II because of the perception of the proximity of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected time. And after life? I loved the scene in the end with the judgment and all the peoples of all nations united. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer - a typical British judge), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) defending Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against US Attorney Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - there is a reason for which is an American-). It's so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing film that constitutes a real "tour de force". The message of the film is clear: in the universe, the law is the most important, but on earth, nothing exceeds the love between humans. The way this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood film could ever do.
