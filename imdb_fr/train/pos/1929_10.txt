I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad Swim at Fort. Lauderdale Film Festival and I have to say it's the best movie I've seen all year and the only movie I felt inspired to write a commentary on. This film was beautifully made and combined a script with realistic dialogue, excellent acting and an inspiring message. Ordinary lives come together in an adult swimming class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life. This is poignantly illustrated by the images of the first minute of this captivating film in which we see only the legs and torso of individuals of various shapes and sizes interfering in a puddle. This film is brilliantly realized because the actors are placed and positioned in captivating scenes, which hold your attention and your imagination.
