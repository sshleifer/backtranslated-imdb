I saw this movie 12 years ago on TNT. It was Susanah York's birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature film with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on TV since. I was interested in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, as a sailor. I think Dale is now narrating Harry Potter's books on Casette, but he's still pretty funny. It's a fast-paced comedy. It's not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures is expected to browse its film collection and consider restoring and releasing this movie on DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious like Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is just as funny as Ramble the sailor. It's an unscrupulous comedy, the kind of movie we do not see anymore, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars on ****
