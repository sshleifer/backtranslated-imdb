Director Edward Mountain does in just over an hour what other more expensive and excited films fail to do. Mr. Mountain shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr., which, although not one of the best of its kind, keeps the viewer involved in everything that happens. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a B movie. In fact, the best thing to do for "The Tattooed Stranger" is an opportunity to take a look at the New York look during of those years. The limpid cinematography of William O. Steiner has either been preserved over the years or restored with love. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence offers a breathtaking view of New York. Later, we will go to Brooklyn in the Dumbo section and later, the film will go to the Bronx and the Gun Hill Road area where there are many monuments shops. <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella have a great detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as a botanical expert at the Museum of Natural History. We see Jack Lord, who has done more important things in his career, in a non-speaking role. <br /> <br /> It was very fun to watch a city as it was, because it no longer exists.
