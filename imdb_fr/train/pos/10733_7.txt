Watching this movie again really reminded me of beautiful childhood memories. I'm 34 years old now, I have not seen it since I was 12-14 years old. I had almost forgotten this movie, but when I saw it recently, some scenes literally brought me a tear! This little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like reliving my childhood. It was an absolutely amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this movie for this reason. I hope that some of you readers will understand my experience, not for this film in particular, but for any film that you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> -Thanks for your reading
