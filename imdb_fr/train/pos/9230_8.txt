There is so much to say about this movie. This is not your typical non-exploitation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but this is almost incidental to the story. <br /> <br /> It takes place in the 15th century in Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians occupies a good part of the film. It was interesting, when everyone was running behind the Muslim palaver, that the Mother Superior asked, "Why do you fear Muslims, they will do nothing that Christians have done to you?" Admittedly, there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a convent for defying her father. In the process, she witnesses and endures many things: the gelding of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun who was defeated during a visit of the sect of Tarantula and she fled with a Jew. The torture was particularly horrible with hot wax spread over the nun and cut nipples. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia will continue to get in trouble by questioning the predominantly male society in which she lives. She even asks Jesus why the father, the son and the holy spirit are all men. <br /> <br /> Finally, she joins the Muslim leader as her lover and they plunder the convent. Here is where you see more flesh than you can enjoy at the same time. But the tragedy is coming. She manages to take a sweet revenge on everyone, including the duke and her father, but finds that the Muslim lover treats her in exactly the same way. She is a woman and that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end, but this is prior to the Saw or Inn's torture. by decades. <br /> <br /> Fans of non-exploitation will be satisfied with the treats, but moviegoers will find a lot of meat to digest.
