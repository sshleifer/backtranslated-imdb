Bored by the normal, everyday basic movies to watch Halloween that I saw again and again, I tried my luck on "The Sentinel", hoping that my horror juice could sink again. Mind you, I was coming back to see Dark Castle's remake of "The House on Haunted Hill" - a complete and total crap. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" took me away! In a captivating story about a model who settles into a terrifying Brooklyn Hights building, the film offers everything I hope to find in a good movie: (1) Campy and Fantastically Juicy Characters, Exchanges and Dialogues, including the hilarious turnings of Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum and, more specifically, Martin Balsam, as a distracted teacher - (2) Scary Terror! Not to give a frame, but there are scenes in this movie that have cooled me down to my pancreas - (3) Fantastic gore, fantastic makeup and wacky (though very uneven) direction of Michael Winner, which runs rather good with this unreal treat. If you liked "Dead Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising", this will be your favorite queen. Just to emphasize my love for this film - after looking at it for the first time, gaping, I rewound it and looked again. It's now one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check!
