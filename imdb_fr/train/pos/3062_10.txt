I saw this movie a few months ago on the cable and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just amazing. He makes you love his character, even when he is clearly the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives a performance that is without a doubt the best performance I've seen by an actress this year. She is fantastic as a wild and wise young woman beyond her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is simply terrifying as Macy's father, and John Ritter is fine as a psychic stuck in the middle of everything that's going on. <br /> <br /> I wish it was in the cinema because I feel it's a film that should be seen by a wider audience. It's a shame, because it's a lot better than most of the new movies coming to the cinema now. <br /> <br />
