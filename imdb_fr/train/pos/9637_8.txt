This film has a special way of telling the story. At first, I found it rather strange because it jumped in time and I did not know what was going on. real and touching. You met someone the first time, you fell completely in love, but you ended up separating yourself and you caused a deadly agony. Who did not go through that? but we will never forget that kind of pain in our life. <br /> <br /> I would say that I am rather touched because two actors showed great performances showing the love between the characters. I just wish the story could be a happy ending.
