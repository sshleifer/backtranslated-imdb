I must admit that this film moved me to the point of bursting into tears. However, I always think twice about things, and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as perfect and impeccable, I prefer to take the risk of looking closer. <br /> <br /> First point: the film has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it begins and continues as a slow film that does not try to amaze you with the real scenes of September 11th. Congratulations to this stroke of genius, because unlike the WORLD TRADE CENTER of Stone, this film does not focus fortunately on the attack itself, but on the fallout that, similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion, are barely visible but still dangerous and devastating. The psychological impact, the devastation that 9/11 caused and the devastation it caused to Americans are almost palpable in this film. I think Binder has made a clever observation of post-9/11 American society and Sandler, in my opinion, has gone from being an average comedy actor to a real talent that delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. However: In the film BLOOD DIAMOND, the character of Di Caprio says and I quote: "Oh, these Americans, they always want to take into account their feelings". Now, I do not want to minimize their suffering, but I would like to make a comparison. Since September 11, the world has been confronted with memories, memorials and 9/11 commemorations. The Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer do more than hint at September 11 in their works. Now, this huge amount of cultural products, facing September 11, makes the death of 3,000 people the greatest tragedy of this young century. The number of books written on the subject and the number of films made on this subject, and I say that with all due respect, make the importance of this atrocious crime a bit disproportionate. <br /> <br /> The fact is: People are dying every day as a result of unjust acts and horrific crimes committed by bad or simply misguided people. We have a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and many other countries. On a daily basis, we forget about the poverty of the African people and we tend to sympathize with them to a lesser degree than the American 9/11 victims, simply because they are black and their lives are not a lot to do. common with our western lives. Africa has neither the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies as America can. So, here's what I say: The reason we feel more for the 3,000 victims of 9/11 and their families is that we are constantly reminded of 9/11. Not a day goes by without a newspaper article, movie or book about September 11th. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I congratulated Charlie Fineman, but I did not know if I had the right to feel more for him than for a Hutu who lost all his family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> You are depriving yourself of savings?
