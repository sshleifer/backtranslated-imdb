Even though I do not agree with Bob and Tammy's decision to abandon baby Jesse, and that's something I would never do, they were trying to do what was best for the baby . The way this film is written allows you to wrap yourself in the story and ask yourself what you really believe in all its aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unheard of, as far as I'm concerned. But during the movie, she really convinces you that she is psychotic, or at least she has something serious. His character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed". The film seems to end quickly, leaving things a bit unresolved. But other than that, this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch when you just want to relax and watch something cute that will make you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others and discover a little something about yourself. Warning: you can even grow up watching this movie! And it's worth it, finally.
