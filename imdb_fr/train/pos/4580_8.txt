Princess Tam Tam does not have the appearance of racism, as we think in the United States, but there are more subtle assertions (for the American viewer) about ethnic identity over time. Pay attention to the placement of Alwina (Baker) in the shots, in the way she is approached by the other characters, to the scenery that surrounds her who all describe her as an "African wild", and ask yourself if Alwina has the slightest fagot throughout the film. I do not want to spoil anything but in the end, be very attentive, the dichotomy between "Eastern" and "Western" culture is shocking to say the least, such a diction is fortunately disavowed nowadays. The French have a checkered past as an imperial force in all the regions represented (see Chris Marker's Statues Meurent Aussi - 1953) and are interested in the places visited by European travelers when they are in Africa and how their attitudes are reflected towards "the other". I give a 7 to this film because I'm a sucker for Baker, which is regressive is largely what she did in her professional career, like the Tam Tam Princes. sorry.) However, the film is captivating for me because of its performance, in addition to being a vestige revealing outdated mentalities.
