The performances of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole of chemistry complement each other well, as well as the minimalist approach of narrative and direction by Govind Nihlani. The dialogues of Vijay Tendulkar are also excellent. <br /> <br /> I did not see another movie like this. It's a whole, each piece fits perfectly in the plot. You can not not be impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri becomes the authoritarian husband and the "baap" of Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives the right touch to the movie with his smiling and sweet villain. Anand Velankar's first meeting with Rama Shetty at Sadhashiv is absolutely staggering. Smita Patil does not play a leading role, but her role does not bother the main plot either. <br /> <br /> And to add to all this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who has mastered the system and its operation. Say good things in the right places and know how to stay out of trouble. He is also the "guru" of Om Puri and helps him whenever he has problems. The film highlights not only the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty, but also the other side of brutality in police custody. Om Puri captures the desperation and burning desire to free himself during this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A treat for all avid fans of Indian cinema.
