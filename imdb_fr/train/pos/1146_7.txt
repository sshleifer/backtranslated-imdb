This film is about a fictional soap opera. It's very fast and fun. To say anything else would ruin the movie. There are several plots and subplots in the film. This film has an overall cast with the hottest stars of today. They all give on the best performances. This movie is my favorite movie of the year 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of daytime / prime-time soap operas !!!
