This film surprised me in a good way. From the box, I felt like it was an action thriller, but it was too funny, even if it was a little exciting. This film and James Belushi was born to make Bill Manucci, he does a great job. The rest of the cast is not mean either and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat. <br /> <br /> The story can become quite confusing as new characters manifest themselves during the movie. Things get complicated, nobody rarely says the truth. If you're not careful, things may get a little complicated in the end, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not very well known, but he did a perfect job with this one. and I never really got impatient watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The manufactured men deserve to be discovered.
