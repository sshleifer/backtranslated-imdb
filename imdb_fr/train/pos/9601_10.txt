Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenager (Weems) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and his 11 friends who take him on a trip across the country to see if "Pimp My Ride" will come out of his wheelchair. <br /> <I recently watched this film at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the festival. This film is an incredible story about the human spirit and spirit of Weem's friends. I do not say it often about movies, but after watching this movie, I felt compelled to do something for the cause. Every festival this film has participated in, this film has won some prize. It's at the Tribeca Film Festival, and it's happening in London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie goes up to the Oscars. It's snowballing out of control. If anyone is lucky enough to see this movie, wherever it is, go for it! Take as many people as you can and go! He travels to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, Florida. Darius is from Georgia. So I think the tickets for the show in Atlanta will be quickly exhausted, if they are not already. Please, see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
