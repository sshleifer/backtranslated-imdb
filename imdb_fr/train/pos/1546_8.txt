I saw this film once in or near its release 36 years ago (1969). Although I only remember a few fragments, I can not wait to see him again. The parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, include Mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering sexual favors in the back of a closed truck to get military information from him . The score was particularly memorable and the emotion was palpable in the Gone With The Wind league and I would love to hear it again. There must be a commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. Does anyone know why? I doubt that it has anything to do with a lack of quality or interest.
