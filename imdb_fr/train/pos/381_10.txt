I gave this film 10 steps because it is a superbly coherent film, but for its pure ability to evoke emotions in his audience. The story of the fight against a single woman is an old clich√©, but very few films have conducted it with as much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> showed a different side of the African-American experience - showing that after the freedom of slaves was granted, many fell into the habits of the hated "white man" and abused their own people. I think it's important because it goes against the tendency to portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar. <br /> <br /> Actor performances are also superb - especially Oprah with whom I am now having a new respect for. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching - but keep some tissues close at hand.
