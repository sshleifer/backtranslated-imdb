This is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. It's one of John Woo's first films and one of the few traditional martial arts films he has made. You can see his influences from working under Chang Cheh in this movie. The action is good, the combat choreography is directed by Fong Hak On, who appears as one of the villains of the film. It stars Wei Pei's "Five Venoms" fame and a host of familiar faces for fans of the Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions. The story is interesting, there are some decent plot twists and building characters and their relationships with each other are cleverly done. This film only had a VHS output in the UK. Media Asia has released a DVD of Region 3 and there are DVD versions available in the United States. The film is enjoyable to watch either in its original language or in its dubbed version in English. I highly recommend this movie.
