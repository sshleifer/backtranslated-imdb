One of the great mysteries of life, which we experience every day, is why pretty girls are more interested in shaking and heels than in good boys. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, when the Gentiles even want to get married These girls, girls always prefer jerks and heels, even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt, have shown that they were just interested in using the girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is the nice boy, who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after completely losing the girl. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is the asshole, and he's perfect in the role, rather a sad note for his fans. <Jean Harlow appears as a slender Mae West, even evoking The West in some of his cynical lines to throw. <br /> <br /> What is pretty amazing is that so many other characters, meant to be mean - I mean, damn it, they're locked up, so they have to be - are of any obvious nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are a lot of nice people here, people who, in a tenant r movie or story, is cringe, but here they do their best to help other. <br /> <br /> The story may be a little cliche, at least by modern standards, the viewer will be happy to have watched. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have to make is that so many very good actors do not have credit. Once again, we can say a "Thank you" fervent to IMDb.com.
