I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having done it, I am very happy to have this movie to add to my collection. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, directors, took less than a month to shoot and spent about 1 million euros to produce this fantastic movie. This proves that not only great productions make good films. <br /> <br /> The title of this film fits perfectly. In computer language, BUG denotes a program error causing reactions from the computer. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also great moments of beauty. The vertiginous events of this film begin with the death of a BUG. A man witnesses the "crime" on the other side of the road ... From there, everything gets complicated ... <br /> <br /> I mention John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece , the man who can not arrange everything at all.
