Given its release date, the story that takes place in the thriller "Panic in the Streets" in 1950 was hardly a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed on as a stranger until a thorough examination by a public health inspector who says the body carries a strain of bubonic plague. Yet, with the current drama in the world today, it strangely helps this film to appear credible to today's viewers. The actors and the team are flawless. Richard Widmark in his first role after his decisive performance in "Night and the City", Jack Palance in his chilly debut, also starring in this film Paul Douglas and the young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole series of non-professional and uncredited actors (typical of the director Kazan) occupy the remaining places. Director Elia Kazan and films Joe MacDonald (he will later work with Richard Widmark again in "Pickup on South Street" from 1953 much higher) and the great Alfred Newman marks it. Almost everyone involved here has done a better job, "Panic in the Streets" is nonetheless a rewarding watch. Especially for movie lovers.
