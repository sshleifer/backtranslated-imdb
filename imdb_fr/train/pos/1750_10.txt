Well, let me just say something about these actors, it was really a good decision, and from experience, having actors really gives life to the dialogue. If you arrive at this even a quarter of an hour late, you will be shocked, the film will have already begun. You do not want to miss the first jokes, assuming you do not miss a joke. <br /> <br /> Wow! I have never seen a film that ended with such an end. Not to be hard, I mean I loved it, but it surprised me that it continued until it stopped! But I'm getting ahead, start at the beginning, when it started. The diagram of the plot looks like this: there is this man, and do not give up spoilers, (* Spoiler Alert !! *) (he never had sex (!), They use this tool of plot to move the story, and there is (intentionally or not, it could go one way or the other) amusing situations of the main characters, some containing irony, jokes and situations uncomfortable, you know. <br /> <br /> The director uses the progress of technology by combining the film shot on the set and the scripted dialogue, music and jokes to make a funny film, conceived as a comedy , where he takes us on a generic journey to the end with an entirely complete film I went in this film hoping to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew about it and I felt as if I had just left a theater that had just played a role of comedy TEN STARS !!!
