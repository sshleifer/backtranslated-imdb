"Panic in the Streets" is a little film little known by director Elia Kazan. It was shot before his classic masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan had already won an Oscar in 1947, before this film. So he was not completely unknown at the time. Still "Panic in the Streets" is mainly a film that went under the radar. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this film is its scenario, which won an Oscar. He has a very good concept and his excellent thriller material very tense with a touch of element crime / film noir. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely beautiful and gives the film an impression of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is relatively unknown (especially at the time of release), but it still contains Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their leading film roles. Palance particularly impresses as a gangster leader, with a very powerful face. <br /> <br /> The film lingers a little at certain points. The film starts very well but after the beginning, the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of rhythm and point of view of the story. <br /> <br /> Yet, "Panic in The Streets" remains a perfectly listenable film, mainly because of its solid script and powerful dialogue that makes it a believable movie to watch. This is a fantastic movie to watch for fans of the thriller genre. <br /> <br /> 8/10
