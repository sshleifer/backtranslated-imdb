It is true. The film is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I like the book. But the film is so much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I've never seen Scatman Crothers and obviously Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this film are better than those in the book. But I already mentioned it in my comment on the mini-series. But I missed a few. The film is shot in a better place than the one where the miniseries was shot. And the REDRUM scenes are more frightening than those in the book. So, if you're looking for a good movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But expect to have nightmares every night for 3 weeks
