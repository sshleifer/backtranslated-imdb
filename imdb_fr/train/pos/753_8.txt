Story of four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most balanced of the group, but she wants to leave her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than others. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new compared to what we have seen many times before - but it has a big difference - that's right. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and was surprised at how realistic it was. They perfectly understood the dialogue, the clothes and the attitudes. Even the main song of the movie ("On the Radio" by Donna Summer) was a big hit before it was released. This film hit me more than any other teen movie of the day, because I could understand the characters and understand the link. I knew girls in high school who were like that! The film is (of course) dated but it captures a moment that we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The acting game is good in all respects, with Foster offering the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) has played more realistically a teenager. <br /> <br /> A very good film, essential if you become an adult in 1980. the film has a deserved R rating (drug use and swear words in abundance) but should be seen by all teenagers. I give him an 8.
