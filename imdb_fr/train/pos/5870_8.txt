JACKNIFE is a beautiful adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's play "Strange Snow" (the screenplay was also written by Metcalfe), made with care by David Hugh Jones, who explores the all too often forgotten effect of the battle on veterans permanently damaged by the terrible cruelties of the war. It is particularly moving to return to this 1989 film as we watch soldiers returning from the war in Iraq and the brutal treatment they receive in our veterans' hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends left for Vietnam. War together and only two people came back alive: the problem is that while the two men are suffering in combat, Flannigan's David 'Highschool' (Ed Harris) is so severely damaged by post-traumatic stress disorder that he "exists" in a drunken void with her sister teacher Martha (Kathy Baker). As David deteriorates, his boyfriend Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city to try to help his friend. During the events, Jacknife begins by offering his help to Martha, then the two appointments - a ball must attend - and William must attend -, the latter drunk falls completely, destroying the relics of the school and terrifying them. inhabitants and students. Jacknife brings Dave back to the moment in Vietnam where they lost their friend and brings David to the point where he can begin his climb to recovery. And Jacknife, who has been suffering for a long time, also finds his needs supported. <br /> <br /> The three actors perform amazingly well: Ed Harris offers one of his most accomplished roles while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards. set by their career. More people should help resurrect this almost forgotten film because it is a fragile reminder of the damage done by our wars to the men who fight them and to the families who receive them after the end of the fight. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
