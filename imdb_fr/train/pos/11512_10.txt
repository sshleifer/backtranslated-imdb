When it was screened for the first time in the United States in 1972, "The Night Stalker" became the highest rated film for T.V. film in history. Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, he tells how an intrepid investigative journalist named Carl Kolchak (late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in Las Vegas. When she arrived on British television four years later, it did not have the same impact, but my friends talked about it at school on Monday morning, as it was myself. We all agreed that this was one of the most exciting things we had seen. <br /> <br /> I did not know about "The Night Strangler" until it appeared almost a decade later. I.T.V., who screened the films "Kolchak", had apparently decided to transmit the derived series; "Barnaby Jones" with Buddy Ebsen is rather a draw and viewers may confuse "Kolchak" with "Kojak"! For years, my only source of information about the show was an article in Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice's novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 presented the show as part of a supernatural series called "Mystery Train" and hosted by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' found itself next to 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Earth Vs.The Spider'. The first titles were cut off, suppressing Kolchak's whistle and the ending credits ... well, there was none. <br /> <br /> The first episode presented was 'Werewolf'. I can not say I was too impressed, but I stayed with it and I'm glad I did! <br /> <br /> I really wish I had seen it in 1974. My twelve years would have loved it. Scary, humorous, exciting, no wonder it sparked Chris Carter's imagination. <br /> <br /> The biggest highlight of the show was, of course, McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was a figure of all men, dressed eccentrically, rather conservatively. It was to the supernatural what Columbo was to crime. The late Simon Oakland was also very good with Tony Vincenzo, the bad leader of Kolchak. The scripts were brimming with a wonderful, dry mind. I found myself enjoying the program more for content in humor than for horror. At the end of the twenty episodes, I felt helpless. <br /> <br /> "The X-Files" arrived a few years later and filled the void, but only to a certain extent. I wanted to recover Kolchak and Vincenzo. I'm glad the show has never been revived. Without Oakland, it would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I have rice books now and I have read them many times. I was very surprised when Stephen King first announced (in his book "Dance Macabre") because he is as good as anything he wrote. <br /> <br /> All right, some of the monsters were at the cutting edge of technology, so what? The new "Kolchak" totally missed the purpose of the original. What you do not see is sometimes more scary than what you do ... <br /> <br /> Best episode - The worst episode of "The horror in the heights" - "The sentinel"
