I've been looking for "Dick Tracy" for years, and as a result, it's become an essential part of my life - it was with me throughout my childhood and I saw him quite often. Seeing him now, as an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The nomination of Pacino to an Oscar was hardly mentioned, except that it is rarely discussed and did not make much noise when it came out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is on top of it, but it's good because he clearly has a lot of fun. Beatty is super like Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a black movie cartoon better than any other movie, perhaps, that I've ever seen. Watching a scene from the movie is breathtaking. Lighting, velvet shades and smog / smoke combine to create an excellent effect. <br /> <br /> There are some really funny cameos, like Dustin Hoffman's one in the role of "Mumbles" and I do not think there is any fault In terms of actor, even the obligatory character is better than expected. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a very good movie that has been misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5.7 / 10 average on IMDb. Critics of the reviews are very positive (visit RottenTomatoes.com) and after watching the movie, it's not hard to understand why: it's a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic, style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
