The case of the tail of the Scorpion is a very elegant giallo directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be a master giallo second after Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous fool, complex but ultimately complex. mystery of murder very satisfying and entertaining. It also makes sense in the end, a big plus, because it is not always the case for these giallo, because they tend to extend their credibility with their endless panic and their ultimate solutions. Here, the less you know about the plot, the better. <br /> <br /> The pure brands of giallo present here are the beautiful cinematography, the catchy musical score, the beautiful women (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), the brutal murders, murderers gloved of black and explicit sex scenes for to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most areas, he is decently acting, Goerge Hilton and his usually suave entourage and the others are doing pretty well. Martino steers with a sure hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some fantastic play pieces. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of giallo, it's a must. If you like thrillers well written and suspenseful in general, this is highly recommended.
