Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. This one crosses this border with brio. Just a remake, I do not think so! I saw him at the age of nine and I was completely fascinated and delighted by the movie. <br /> <br /> The film certainly invites comparisons with its counterpart of 1963. The previous film is also a pleasant and entertaining film, but it certainly tends to look more like a documentary on nature than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. Nevertheless, I highly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a must for an animal lover. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the pointy and sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and the young American bulldog, Chance, who likes to have fun. The animals are brilliantly cast by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. <br /> <br /> There is virtually nothing offensive in the film. There is a little scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No fierce violence, except for a few tense scenes with a waterfall, an angry porcupine and an obscure railway pit. the film did not win any prize, not one. Nevertheless, I must say that this is as good as some of the nominees of the best movie currently.
