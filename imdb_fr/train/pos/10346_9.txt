What contributed to the production of so many excellent Hollywood films around 1939? Anyway, the magic is also found in this photo of Columbia. Turner Classic Movies began showing a long-forgotten dumpling comedy. (The Maltin film book does not contain it.) Amazing Mr. Williams is a jewel in almost every department. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a first-rate police detective who never finds time to marry his plan. While the wedding bells will soon ring, he is summoned to the scene of a murder. The lady in question must learn the hard way, not only to prosecute the criminals, but also to belong to the police. There are a lot of laughs in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas has once again proven that he has few peers in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the top of her career and is a delight. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The film lasts a bit too long, but who cares? Screwball's comedies are always able to entertain and this film is one of the best.
