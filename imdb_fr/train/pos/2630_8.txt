"The Lion King" is without a doubt my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought maybe I should give it a chance and that's what I did. The Lion King 1 1/2 was very good and we had a good laugh and laughed with Timon and Pumba. Only problem, I sometimes feel that no explanation is necessary, because they can create holes in the plot and give the impression of wanting your own explanation. Well, I would highly recommend this movie to Lion King fans or to a family party. It's a fun movie with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first one. I hope I will get the same with the third installment of The Lion King series. Sit back and think about Hakuna Matata! It does not mean worry! <br /> <br /> 8/10
