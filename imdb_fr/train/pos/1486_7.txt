I was very happy to see a Milanese film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who understood correctly and happily in a film the Milanese philosophy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a typical Milanese couple, ranging from "birth" to death. The birth wedding is so typical of any project that becomes original and involves all wedding guests in a flashback story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. Life is hard in the heart of Milan and after the candies have become increasingly difficult, the product finally: a child who, instead of further strengthening the relationship, is weakened because of "the selfish effect "typical of today's metropolis" personality.The advertising environment where the "creative" and stressful atmosphere reigns helps to get involved in the plot.We lose the values ​​of life and this is deeply reflected in this Senza Pelle's friendly and precise film. <br /> <br /> The actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca is nice and well characterized, with a positive surprise, an unexpected good, Fabio Volo, well known in the television series "trash": The Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
