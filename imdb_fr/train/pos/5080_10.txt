Whenever a film is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer, you can bet that all his images will be seen for one generation after another. Just having Claudette Colbert, (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", '47 appearing and starring in the movie will make it an even more awesome movie. In this film, Ellen Ewing gets married then she meets all kinds of mental problems and even murders. The mystery is more and more complex and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge", 65, comes to the rescue of Ellen and you can even sometimes ask if David is at the top. When you visualize this image, you are just beginning to understand who the real madman is, and suddenly you start to change your mind about the end of the movie. Excellent interpretation of Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan who played a role totally different from the one he usually plays on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to a big movie star, Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie, with big classic actors!
