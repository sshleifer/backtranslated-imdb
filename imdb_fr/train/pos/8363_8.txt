This is one of Edgar Wallace's best classic movies of the German series. It contains all the basic elements for a very nice cop cop movie in the 60s: even if his majesty, Mr. Kinski, miss you, you still have the young Joachim 'Blacky. 'Fuchsberger, who once again plays as a great American integrator, you have the young Eddi Arendt in his best role (and just as typical) - the British butler, cool and sophisticated - and you have (not so young now) Lowitz as the ironic police investigator (and therefore very entertaining) melancholy and yet very "dry". In addition, you will have a "devilish guy" monstrous and very campy behind a frog mask (hence the title of the film!), You will get a delirious soundtrack, classic scenes of movie B, partially filmed outside the film. The craziest prospects (remember the time of its origin!), Screaming howls of queens, and so on ... All these ingredients flounder in a tasty cocktail composed of pure German Germany Edgar Wallace - highly recommended !!
