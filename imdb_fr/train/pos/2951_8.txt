Yes, it's a chick movie and it moves a little slowly, but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man. You have to love Judy Davis, no matter what she's in, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural and convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The landscape of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and fits well with the major theme of the film. The unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses gives a realism to the film that attracts you and holds your attention. Overall, I give him an 8/10. Go see him.
