I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and I was intrigued by this woman painter I had never heard before. So I started exploring his life and working afterwards. As expected, I discovered that the film was not exactly accurate historically. I was a little surprised by the very negative comments about the film because of this vagueness. Come on guys, a movie is not and should not be a biography (or a novel!). Every historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right. A director has the full right to use elements of reality and history to create his own world. Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it has brought many people (including some who are now making negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
