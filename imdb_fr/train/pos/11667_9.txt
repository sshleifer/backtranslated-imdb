Kells' Secret is a film I've been waiting for for years after watching a few early pictures at Kilkenny's Cartoon Saloon. I am here to tell you now that it was worth the wait. The drawings are very stylized but not boring as I feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly like the animated illuminated book where little figures come to life on the page. The characterization is superb, I like the voice of Brendan Gleeson as a severe abbot and I particularly liked the voice of Aisling sprite. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well done, a mix of facts and fantasies. and really draws the viewer to encourage Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book. I love calligraphy and enlightenment, so the subject is close to my heart, but everyone I know who has seen this and who is not a fan of the trade agrees that it is a charming little film. I will certainly buy the DVD as soon as it comes out and I want to say: congratulations to Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this gigantic project. Maybe a lot more. :) Come back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and that I distributed them at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck of the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nomination.
