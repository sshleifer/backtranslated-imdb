"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen. Of course, it's a rather weak budget, but it's a non-stop comic feat. There are tons of memorable quotes. For example, when his future father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I shoot between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh of course, it's Candy's delivery that sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a shady filmmaker. An excerpt from his horrendous, low-budget movie "Kung Fu U" will get you rolling. <br /> <br /> So, if you are a fan of Candy and want to rediscover a forgotten jewel, I can not recommend this film to you.
