I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and I found it very funny. I did not laugh that much during a movie for a long time. I thought all the actors had done a good job. You will find yourself laughing from the first moment until the very last scene. I think some movie buffs (especially those who take themselves too seriously) will be disappointed by this brand of humor. Not me. The film was a real surprise. And all the theater burst out laughing throughout the projection I went to, which makes me think that many people were having fun and were happy to have a good time at the movies to change. I can not wait to see him again! If you're in the mood for LOL, this is for you. Funny funny funny funny!
