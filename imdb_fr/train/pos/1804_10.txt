First of all, I was never afraid of this jewel underestimated when I was a child ("Little Mermaid", by cons ...). As my title says, it was one of my favorite childhood movies that I still adore as a teenager. This is a beautiful bittersweet movie about an unsuitable German Shepherd named Charlie (fantastically voiced by Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his boss / partner in crime (his name is ha ha ha is carface). Charlie is sent directly to paradise by default because "all dogs go to paradise because unlike people, dogs are naturally good, loyal and kind". Chalie is sent back to Earth because he has developed a clock that makes him even more unhealthy with his best friend, Itchy, and a little orphan, Anne-Marie. I used to look at it all the time as a child and I still watch it sometimes. Anyway, it's a beautiful bittersweet film, as I said before, that could leave you a tear in the eye ...
