I know a lot of people do not like this movie, but I find it just adorable. I can not say much, but the film is a film of well-being, I suppose. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are many funny lines in the film, especially as Briggitta learns what to do or not to do for society. If you like musicals, I'd say you'd like this one!
