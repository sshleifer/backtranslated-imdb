John Waters gave us a really nice movie. It is certainly not without its shocking moments related to Water, but it is more docile than its old cult discourses, such as "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" takes us back to the beginning of John's mainstream scene in that he reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that is found in "Polyester". All in all, a really fun comedy with good times!
