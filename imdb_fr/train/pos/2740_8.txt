A huge black-and-white nocturnal cinematography, and many of them, sheds light on this allegedly true account of the 1950s murder in Kansas, where an entire family was wiped out by two men. <br /> <br /> The story was written by Truman Capote, so you get the very liberal anti-death sentence message at the end of the film, which is ridiculous to know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson embody the two atheist losers who have a twisted view of life and who needlessly murder this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying aspect of the end, it's a fascinating story from the beginning and cinematography makes it even more fascinating. Famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job in this regard. It makes me wish that more modern films are shot in black and white. See the DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and all the actors are excellent here. My third screening of this film took place in early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent in the murder trial of his wife. We can not help but watch Blake and this film differently afterwards.
