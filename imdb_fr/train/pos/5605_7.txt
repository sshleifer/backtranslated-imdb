This oddity of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his concerns lie at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Paris apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what brought him there, to the point where he dresses in drama and reproduces the events as they unfolded. The film is disturbing to a point, and there is that terrifying atmosphere of terror in which Polanski excels, but it sounds like a repetition of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion", two other Polanski's best films about the sinister adventure. in bad mood apartments. <br /> <br /> But with regard to the concern ... unless I read too much in the film, I have to believe it was Polanksi's reaction to the feeling of persecution he was feeling at be labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Do not judge him in one way or another, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
