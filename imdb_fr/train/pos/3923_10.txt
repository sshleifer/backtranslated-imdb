It's an amazing film, both for the energy incredibly evoked by the frenetic dance of flamenco, and for the unique way in which filmmakers blend the history of stage production with the life of the characters who are preparing for it. Binding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. It is not Bizet's Carmen by any usual standard. It's not a usual movie in every way. Every nuanced look, every stride of the foot, every piece of music is so intimately linked that you can not turn your eyes away from the screen. You do not need to love opera or flamenco (not me) to be captured, enchanted, captivated by this movie. Subtle and direct; strong and motionless; One of the movies of this kind, if not the best, because there are so few.
