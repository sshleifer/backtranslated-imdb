Very different subject treated in this film. A simple and simple description of local Chinese customs, examining the daily operation of a public bath run by the former owner and his belated son, when his eldest son returns home, mistakenly believing that his father is dead. How each man in town makes his daily visit to chat, play games, discuss personal issues and get honest advice, in addition to the usual spa-like therapies. When the old man dies, strong and loyal family ties allow his eldest son to take charge, so the operation of the public baths is not disrupted. And finally, the arrival of modernization puts an end to this mode of relaxation and good agreement. The public bath must be demolished to make room for a commercial complex.
