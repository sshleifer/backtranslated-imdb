At 14, I came across Linda Feferman's Seven Minutes in Heaven. I worked in a video store and loved it. I recently reviewed the film and realized that it was a lost treasure. The movie star Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years ago, won an Oscar for Beautiful Mind, as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is undoubtedly a softer, softer and softer version of the Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful movies of the 1980s, which is why it is so good. It's honest, not forced like these movies, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with their kids. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's dad leaves the house for a business trip, Jeff will convince her that he should move in because of his family life. it's bad. With the support of Natalie's friend, Polly, exquisitely played by Maddie Corman, she allows it. But this movie is not meant to put children in difficult situations and see what they can do with it. The three main roles are so natural and the surprisingly honest scenario that the best of their performance is heartbreaking. These characters really care about each other. This is a good movie to show to children who reach pre-teen adolescence. <br /> <br />
