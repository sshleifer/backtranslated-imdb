This was one of the funniest and biggest sitcoms to hit national television. It is unfortunate that the show is not placed among the big sitcoms where it really belongs. The actors did a superb job and seasons 1 to 6 were the show at its peak. Although season seven was not as good compared to the previous one, it was still funny. The real problem was season 8. Without Topher Grace or Ashton Kutcher, the show simply collapsed. Not to mention, the other actors were not great if he remained one of the 2 main characters such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are great also) have left showing it would have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) did not help either because he was not well received by fans of the series. I think that had the show ended a year ago, it would certainly have gone down in history as one of the biggest sitcoms. Season 8 was a little dull but the finish was excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I just hope I'll wake up one day to find out that the show is back as a show from the 80's with the same cast because I'm going to miss the hell out of it all.
