I love this episode of Columbo. Perhaps it is because Ruth Gordon is there and she is wonderful as a famous mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is delightful to watch as a charming and kind author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames the husband of her niece, the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge his death since the police abandoned her. I would have liked someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I do not really like Hartley personally. And of course, with Columbo, there are bursts of laughter like when he questions Veronica during a belly dance class. Ruth's Abigail is a smart slug herself and she matches the spirit with Columbo, always played wonderfully by Peter Falk.
