John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, just to name a few, run in Monte Carlo, as well as in other beautiful places in Europe, and are very entertaining. The problem that everyone feels when they are lying to protect themselves is great, and I highly recommend you to watch this movie, it is well worth it! John Candy is in great shape in Once Upon A Crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a good family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone gives stellar performances, excellent acting, good comedy and good timing, which is rare in today's cinema. Big plot, big mystery (which I still like) and overall, it's really worth it. So go get the kids, grab some popcorn, juice, tea or soda and enjoy the show !!!!
