I saw this movie for the first time at a festival. There were a lot of good movies, but few made me think long after, and An Insomniac's Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a talented filmmaker. The shots were great. The cast was perfect. Dominic shone in her role that she designed perfectly. There was not much to know about her character, but she wrote the story in such a way that we liked her. And Ellen, I can not wait to see where she will end! She is very talented and I hope to do some more films. With all the million dollar budgets trying to create cheap thrills, Tess shows that not everything is needed as long as there is a good story and actors. Congratulations to everyone involved in this film. And thanks to Tess and co. to distribute it on DVD!
