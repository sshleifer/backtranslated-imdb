This film is a fun punk rock jerk from start to finish. The Ramones, punk rock princes of the late 70s, appear as such. PJ Soles plays the role of Riff Randle, a rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, his favorite rock band. She keeps school in school and encourages her classmates to join her in jubilant jokes. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Riff's school has hired a new director, Ms. Togar. She is a great and intimidating Amazon, a woman. And she promises to make sure the students know. She even has two students who act as supervisors, who report to her with the dirt of their classmates. Mrs. Togar is particularly determined to catch Riff and end Riff's anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to outwit Togar at every turn. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the wonderful performance of Mary Woronov as Togar. Mary is a legendary actress in movie B. And in this film, she embodies the fascist Mrs. Togar, with a mocking taste. PJ Soles as Riff, achieves an electrifying performance. Clint Howard, the doublet of Eaglebauer, has a lot of fun with his role. <br /> <br /> The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. Thus, the viewer understands why the Ramones were so influential in the 70s punk rock scene. This is certainly a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you're not in Ramones or punk rock, this movie is a fantastic explosion (literally) of energetic fun.
