This film is witty, watchable and quite touching. And now, do you often see Jean Harlow (or an actress of that time, by the way) give another woman a quick punch in the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Harlow's Ruby is sent to a recovery center after being mingled with Gable's Edward Hall (he has that crooked but endearing smile), his situation becomes even more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant and she is convinced that this rake has abandoned her, but in fact, her love has reformed him and he comes to see her, despite the fact that he will be arrested and with the help of a minister, he is married. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with his fellow students is none other than his electrical chemistry with Gable, his main actor. His cynical character perfectly matches the crook with Gable's soft voice. What does not love? <br /> <br /> "You know, you would not look wicked, if it were not for your face!" Ruby makes sharp remarks to Gypsy, his rival. "If you want to get closer to me, I'll have to open the other window!" <br /> <br /> Inestimable !!!
