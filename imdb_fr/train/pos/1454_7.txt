I have been waiting for this movie for a long time since I saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama featuring three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And even though it was directed by Harold Becker, who did an uneven job, he and Pacino allied for SEA OF LOVE, which is among their best works. But interference at a certain level (for starters, several scenes of the original trailer do not appear in the film) and a change of tone (the subsequent trailers give the impression that it is a thriller), which makes the thing more watchable than ever. have been. <br /> <br /> Which is a shame, because I really wanted to love this film. There was a lot of potential here to be a film about how the government can still be useful despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about this corruption, not between the good guys and the usual bad guys. And there is a good game here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is lost in his role, having nothing to do, and while the central scenario has merit, when it turns into a thriller, the film is lost, briefly resumes in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, then falls completely at the end. I wish I could like that more, but no.
