I really liked watching this movie. like most people who watched it. I was not sure to get it. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny humorist and has made a lot of fun movies. Sister act. <br /> <br /> However, it was not really funny. it's a drama with comic moments. So, if you are looking for a riot of laughter, keep looking. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a black family moving from a nice neighborhood in the city to a neighborhood of the upper middle class. I would say more but I think it would spoil the movie. This film not only deals with racial relations between whites and blacks, but also with the black community. I think it's worth a chance. if you're not really interested in seeing another movie about interracial relations, then this movie does not suit you
