Mel Torme and Victor Borge, in their early years, make this film interesting - and especially watching a young Sinatra, on the sunny side of 30 years, and clearly indicating that it was his "yes, I'm a singer popular, but hardly an actor yet "scene. Michele Morgan is a boring and insane presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose call has always been totally lost. Leon Erroll is silly, as always, but overall pretty funny. 7 stars out of a potential of 10 is pretty much the right "note" because with the combination of its positive aspects, the lack of a lot of history, and a silly addition, and the annoyances mentioned above - it is overall average at best. Most of the fascination comes from watching the three icons of entertainment in their early years.
