That's what I saw at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) then asked questions. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing it was a director for the first time and all our congratulations to Harvey Keitel for Once again, he takes a risk and embarks on a scenario that he likes. <br /> <br /> It certainly reminds Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director at the turn of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect a film about the revolution, its political position is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the director's obvious love for the film's history (a great tribute to the "bicycle thief") and to some fanciful scenes that work without pretension. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
