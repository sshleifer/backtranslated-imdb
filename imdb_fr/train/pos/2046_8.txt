Although the soundtrack is a little outdated, this story is more relevant than ever in the United States. With not only blue-collar jobs, but also jobs all over the world outsourced by American companies, while the government benefits and the Americans suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a metalworker who works as his father for 35 years. His wife is well described by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family of two children when Emory loses her job. The factory is closed under the pretext of mismanagement, but there are also malpractices and cheaper wages that allow to pay a metal worker in one month (outsourcing) what he should pay to Strauss / Emory in a day . It does not matter that these men are all good, loyal workers, values-oriented and trying to do their best for their families. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (Strauss's brother) and a few other colleagues are also affected. . It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving. Emory hopes that her local union will be able to reopen the mill, as promised. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother, Lee, already sees the writing on the wall. There are no more jobs in the rusty area (Ohio) and they have to move on. However, where can they go to the United States? Where will it be better for a steel worker? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphal scene at the end, where Emory and his team fill the loading dock with steel products. The guardian allows them to do this as a last gesture. One of the men committed suicide and shows empathy. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good message movie on hard times here in America. Something that few care to deal with until personally affected. 8/10.
