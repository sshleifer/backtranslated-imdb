I was young enough when it was released in the United States, but I recorded it on TV and watched again and again until everything was memorized. To this day, I am still surprised to quote him. The series itself was hilarious and featured many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone, via MT. The voices were excellent and sounded exactly like the characters they represented. The puppets were also well cooked, although a little scary. I was surprised to discover recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show that I also enjoy very much. As another person had written in a comment earlier, I too was stolen from this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a DVD release, but I do not think enough people have heard of it. Oh well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
