CREEP is a horror movie that takes place in real time and aims to show people that they are attacked in an empty metro platform by a mutant for 85 minutes. And it's just that. No more no less. The director Christopher Smith draws the drama as much as he can plausibly by introducing a series of characters that would really have a reason to be in the subway once it is locked. It also leaves the origins of the Creep holder deliberately vague (illicit experiments taking place in the underground of the 60s are evoked) and this little mystery works for the most part. Unfortunately, it weakens in the end by holding back from the end of a twist where more genetic malformations would appear (they are also mentioned). Yes, you heard me right - I wanted a clich√©! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good, the terror star and the rest of the cast are doing well.
