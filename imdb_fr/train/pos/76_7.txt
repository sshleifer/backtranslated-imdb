Vincent Price's sequel to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film that cemented his reputation as a horror icon, also revolves around a bitter film ?? although resourceful? fairground. Although it is a remake, the first (shot in Technicolor) remains the top effort; That said, apart from a resistant comic relief, the obligatory use of cheap gadgets (it was another showcase in 3D) and occasional narrative failures (what happened to the missing bag that would have been found in a police station with a sliced ​​head?), this offers plenty of Grand Guignol-style thrills and overall camp value (Price hides in a variety of disguises as an illusionist posing as a stellar conjurer) "Disappeared" who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand on his own. feet. Incidentally, the participation of director Brahm is not a mere coincidence ?? since the story incorporates elements of two horror titles (both interpreted by Laird Cregar), he had already directed the game, namely THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young protagonists are played by Mary Murphy (as Price's ingenuous assistant) and Patrick O'Neal (her police detective boyfriend, curiously, he would take the lead of the similar film, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966] ], that acquired just in time to serve as bis to this one). Another interesting activity is the adoption by the latter of a new detection technique, the fingerprint, which is essential for Price's fall (in a predictable but rather embarrassing fire climax), although the persistent persistence of his amateur crime writer has at least a lot to do with it in the long run! Looking at the star in a tailor-made role, the film comes out very fun ?? especially to a compact 73 minutes.
