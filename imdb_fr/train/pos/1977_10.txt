I really like this movie. I remember once when I was in grade 2, my teacher showed it to us on a 16mm film reel. This film, however, can be a little scary for Grade 2 students, like the scene where Bill murders Nancy and sees Fagin's face for the first time on screen. One of my relatives is tired of seeing this film because she studied during the music class. If I were a teacher and could rate the people who produced this beautiful film, I would give them an A +.
