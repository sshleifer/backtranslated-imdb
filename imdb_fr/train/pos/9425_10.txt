A series of super comedies of the 1990s (two series in total) that suffered in the ratings of the United Kingdom because of poor programming. When you play well-known comedies like "Minder", even the best news will have a hard time getting noticed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I caught the series of episode 1 and I followed eagerly. I talked to my friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have watched something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> Then, I searched on the Internet and discovered that an ultra-fan was trying to bring out the two series "by itself". <br /> <br /> Both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
