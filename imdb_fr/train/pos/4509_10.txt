The arrival of White Men in the Canadian Arctic challenges the freedom of a fearless hunter from ESKIMO. <br /> <br /> W. S. Van Dyke, MGM's Field Director, was responsible for this fascinating look at Inuit life in the Arctic. Production ran from April 1932 to November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects show that part of the filming took place at the Studio). Regarded at the time as a documentary, we would probably call it "docudrama" because it is written with an intriguing plot and scenario. <br /> <br /> The film shows the everyday life of Eskimo, winter and summer. and, in fact, begins at the hottest time of the year, with no snow or ice in sight. The constant search for food is illustrated and the viewer can witness an exciting walrus, polar bear, whale and caribou hunt. The mother tongue is used everywhere, with the use of title cards; the only English is spoken by the fishermen and gendarmes met by the Eskimos. In fact, it is the arrival of the White Men, good and bad, and the change they bring to the Eskimo society, which is a major element of the narrative. <br /> <br /> This pre-code film deals with Frankly and refreshingly with the moral code of Eskimo, especially with their practice of sharing wives, which was an important and totally innocent part of their culture. In fact, the film as a whole can be viewed as a valuable look at a way of life that disappeared quickly, even in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> None of the actors receives a screen credit, which is a shame because there are some notable performances. The first of these is Ray Wise, who plays Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan native of Indian origin and is absolutely splendid and perfectly credible in a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star, he would continue to play, under the name of Ray Mala, in a sporadic film career, often in tiny unbilled roles. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Japanese and Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays the loyal second of Mala's wife; the names of the beautiful actresses playing her two other women are now obscure. Director Woody Van Dyke appears in front of the cameras as Inspector of the North West Mounted Police. Joe Sawyer and Edgar Dearing, both longtime movie stars, play the two decent-hearted police officers who have to hand over Mala to Canadian justice. The Danish writer Peter Freuchen, whose film is based on books, briefly plays the part of a dark-skinned naval captain who recklessly arouses Mala's icy anger.
