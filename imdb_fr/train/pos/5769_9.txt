Will you all please throw the hell out of Todd Sheets!?! Let's give $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you offer! The guy has 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for free! Of course, the acting is sometimes laughable. Yes, makeup is not better than you can see. But this is not the worst either, if you want to see this, go see Zombie Nation with its zombies of raccoons. <br /> <br /> This is pure, good old guerrilla movie! Todd is an accomplished professional and a nice guy. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems far-fetched. But damn it, I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets out of hiding and remake what he was going to do. If someone has ever tried making a movie, he knows that finishing it is a feat in itself.
