The story would never win rewards, but that's not what it's about ... the script was just entertaining and emotional enough to make way for incredibly choreographed battle scenes. Who needs a story with fighting like this? Really, it's worth watching for that reason alone. IF you can handle the gore, of which there is MUCH ... none of this is realistic enough to be hard to watch. I gave him a 7.
