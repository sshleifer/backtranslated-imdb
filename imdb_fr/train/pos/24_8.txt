Although this is obviously a low-budget production, the performances and songs of this film are worth the detour. One of the few musical roles of Walken to date. (He is a wonderful dancer and singer and he also demonstrates his acrobatic skills - watch the wheel!). Also performed by Jason Connery. A beautiful story for children and very nice characters.
