OK, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best film ever made but it was really fun. My brother and I still play scenes from time to time, and sometimes we'll take the film out of the closet, remove the dust and make it appear. A pleasure to the end, but a great concept. It is a film that must be forgotten to criticize and appreciate. The judgment is a victory for Robot Jox.
