This is my first film directed by David Mamet. Well adjusted, since it was also his first. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and unfolds like any commercial movie, from small inconveniences to major inconveniences, to general inconveniences. It's like "The Grifters", but without the actor level of this movie. (In this film, John Cusack was a bit bland, but it was the nature of his character.) The game here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the fade played by Crouse was supposed to be a kind of attack against the psychoanalysis). At least at the beginning. It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond an extremely hard reading after about ten minutes. At the beginning of the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines - her way of reading them - look like an inner monologue or narration, which they are not. With the arrival of Mantegna, things are improving. <br /> <br /> The dialogues are not as fun as they should be. I was expecting the crackerjack lines to sound, but they do not. All this seems very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet has evolved after this film and has relaxed, but otherwise, he should perhaps let others direct his words. It is far too precious with them here and therefore, they lose their rhythmic and jazzy quality. What's more strange is that, other than that, the film does not look like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked like a movie theater too much, but in this film, the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything has sunk. <br /> <br /> It would not bother me if it sounded like movie characters talking about movie lines - or even playing characters talking about lines of play - but here it sounds like movie characters ( or even book) speaking lines of play. It's a strange mix of theater and film that just does not work. That does not mean that the movie is bad - it's not, it's often very funny. The best part is in the middle. <br /> <br /> This is a usual con movie: the new guy (in this case, the girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the derisory world of the underworld. Her involvement is as follows: she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help her settle her gambling debts, so she goes to the House of Games, a disgusting gambling hall in which crooks work in a back room. I admit that the configuration is rather improbable. (Did they just wait for Crouse's arrival, were they expecting her to write a check, and did Billy receive it?) One of those questions is resolved at the end, though.) <br /> And from here the disadvantages begin to unfold. I found beginners - little learners - the most fun. We receive a lesson in con art just as much as Crouse. <br /> <br /> We see the end come, and then we did not see the second end, and then the real end that I did not see coming but maybe you did it. The ball keeps bouncing and at the last scene of the film, we realize that the second Crouse entered The House of Games, she found her true calling. <br /> <br /> I will forgive the annoying opening, the unlikely bits and the strange line reading, because there are a lot of good things here. If the first part of the film seems shaky, stay there. After half an hour of play, the momentum really begins. If you want a funny scam movie, then here it is. If you want Mamet, look again at "Glengarry Glen Ross" - James Foley did it better. <br /> <br /> ***
