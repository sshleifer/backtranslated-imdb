I loved the movie. She admirably analyzes Italian petty-bourgeois society and explains how the 70s leftists have abandoned all their ideals and come to a happy understanding that they do not wish to disturb. For example, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and does not want to remember his more radical youth. <br /> <br /> Wants to buy the video for a long time after seeing the film several times on the big screen and on television, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy, nobody in the bookstores was aware of the film. a great pity. <br /> <br /> The unique sexual scene, which everyone seems to talk about, does not hurt the film.
