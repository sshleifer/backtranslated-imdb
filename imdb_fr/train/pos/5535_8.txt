The very first image of the film shows a mountain ridge in an early autumn mist and my thought was, "It's almost too good." And it continues like this: Pictures of landscapes and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each one perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may seem old-fashioned and evasive, but it is a story of a silent beauty taking place on the borderline between life and fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and The Little Prince. I enjoyed every minute. The extreme parsimony of the film, a simple and slow story, a single actor and practically no special effect, exerted a powerful magic. I find it deplorable that this parsimony is abandoned in the last minutes, when suddenly two other actors (the girl as an adult woman and her son) are presented. Another gap is the music, which is often intrusive, in Hollywood, and sometimes inappropriate: I could not associate an English pop song with the glory of the French mountain. I went to the film with my two little girls, but I also recommend it to adults, who appreciate this kind of film. Obviously, it's not everyone.
