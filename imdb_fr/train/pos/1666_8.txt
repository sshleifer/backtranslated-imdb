It's a film about 17th century Italian artists and especially a woman, a woman Artemisia, an unprecedented profession for women at the time, and she dared to paint the male nude by detailing her unique musculature. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is mainly inside because that is where the artists have mainly worked. There are beautiful pictures. Close-ups by candlelight suggest the magnificent work of classical painters and it is fascinating to see the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding detailing the details of religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, makeup) are perfectly authentic because the Italian churches have kept all these details in their frescoes for centuries. Her father asks the beautiful Artemisia to study with the great Florentine artist Tassi, who has become an expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but Artemisia, unsuspicious, discovers more than new painting techniques. After posing for her, Tassi rapes her violently. His father is outraged. The judicial proceedings follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory end. The particularity of this film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes such as women running across a field with the wind blowing from their bulky clothes add wonderful effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says she paints to please herself; his father paints to please others. As for this film, it will please most, I think.
