This drawing is short on the plot, but is a visually stunning work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short film has an incredibly light "story". Underground gnomes are responsible for the return of spring every year, but must face a winter not yet ready. withdraw. The gnomes and the storm have their own songs. It's about the plot, as it is. But this caricature does not speak of intrigue, but of color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. In 1936, such a brilliant color was still a novelty and here there is an incredibly inspired work. <br /> <br /> My favorite short film moments surround the movement of liquefied colors through pipes. On several occasions, a series of pipes is aligned, from the smallest to the largest, the colors move through the pipes and the musical track gives the impression that the row is a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The images of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm that refuses to leave quietly are extremely well executed. Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are known for these short films, but they probably also contributed to their ultimate departure from MGM, as this caricature probably exceeded the budget and MGM finally decided that they could better control costs if The animation was managed by a person a little more aware of the costs than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> It's really a beautiful cartoon that is really worth seeing. It is available on the DVD Character attack of the 30s. Recommended, especially if you like a good animation.
