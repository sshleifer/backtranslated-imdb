A couple (Janet and Richard) go camping in the woods near a giant swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm. Soon, two fugitive convicts present themselves and, after delaying the inevitable, they violently violate Janet and lock Richard in a birdcage. <br /> <br /> This film must look like the one of the last house. one of the most underrated horror films ever made. This is one of the most shocking and shocking of the early 70's. Moreover, I found it quite enchanting and beautiful in its perverse tone. I like terror CAGED. The music definitely contributes to giving the film a sense of personality and a lot of beauty. I found the movie quite scary. <br /> <br /> The defects are mainly related to the rhythm of the film, that is to say that the film is rather slow and sinuous. Although the pace due to the beauty and suspense of the movie in question does not bother me, I think it will please most people. The acting is not very good, nor is the dialogue, at least in the first scenes. This movie requires a little more patience than usual, and it's really not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good movie. It's not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly a lot of fun. This is not exactly the easiest movie to find. It is possible to find it in the USED section of many stores if you look enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of cine-bin, it's definitely worth a look.
