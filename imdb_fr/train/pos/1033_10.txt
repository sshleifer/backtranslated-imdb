Say what you want from Schmaltz. A beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a moral that Americans are called to high goals and how they have risen to the occasion. It's a source of inspiration because it's about people with noble intentions. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother of Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "we have been shaken by magnolias". <br /> <br /> In the current political climate, led by a president who has been lying to us and using 9/11 to bring out the absolute worst of human beings, we have fallen to the level of the murderers of the 11 September to seek revenge for bloodthirsty. We can not blame Mr. Bush - after all, we let him lead us in this direction and we even re-elected him after his lies were revealed. Now, with full justification, we Americans are being insulted around the world. <br /> <br /> Today we watch this film with a new awareness: that the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw of the German character, but a fault in the human being which allows us to rationalize everything that would justify our immoral and heinous acts. I do not compare George Bush to Adolf Hitler. But, I point out how a leader can bring us into a frenzy of terror, hatred and hyper-nationalism to do vile things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the master-singer will do everything in his power to make his own expansion, however immoral, most like the leaders of our country, those who support them and those who buried their heads in the sand, to the point of not having the trouble to vote. A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to - a force for the betterment of humanity - and the fact that we now have the desire to achieve great goals. <br /> <br /> Geoff
