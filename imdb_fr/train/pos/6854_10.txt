The intelligent, stylish and captivating thriller of the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is definitely one of his best films! <br /> <br /> When the housewife in trouble is brutally murdered by a stranger, the son of the victim joins a prostitute to discover the killer. <br /> <br /> Dressed to Kill left a strong impression on the audience of its time and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing installation and builds itself into a heartbreaking, heart-wrenching mystery. The finale and the conclusion are particularly "nightmarish". This is a real benefit of your seat. Even more impressive is De Palma's elegant orientation, which gives this film not only a tight suspense, but also a unique and dark atmosphere. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film, but in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a beautiful score to the film. <br /> <br /> Distribution is another strong element of this film. Michael Cain does a great job as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as an unhappy housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as a walker involved is solid. A young Keith Gordon is also a valuable support as an investigative son. <br /> <br /> There are many who blame De Palma's films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But all the similarities between the works of Hitchcock and De Palmas can only be considered as a quality, because to call this film a "scam" would be to become a beautiful thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must for all movie fans. <br /> <br /> **** on ****
