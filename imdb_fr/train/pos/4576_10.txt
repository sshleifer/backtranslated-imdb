I thought it was an absolutely charming film, centered on the life of the characters of Mary-Kate and Ashley, Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make themselves happy as well as their parents, but; unfortunately, it's not so easy for them to do it! I thought it was a very sweet and sweet movie and if you're a real fan of these wonderful young women, then I'm sure you'll agree with me here! If you have not seen this movie yet, then I tell you that you really missed it; a lot of time, and you should definitely take the time to see it now! This film is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
