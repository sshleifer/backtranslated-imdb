me and my sister praised this every time we had movies and our parents were so angry at us (but they allow us anyway) and I love it ... I can not find anyone who lives near me and know what i am talking about ... i am glad to see that i am not the only one to love this movie ... i would love to find it somewhere on DVD !! I would love to watch this now just because I loved it so much as a little child ... and I'm 15 now! I remember it so much ... This is where I got the song of the little rabbit fufu and all my friends know the song but not the movie !! I think the little girl came up there slipping down her toboggan
