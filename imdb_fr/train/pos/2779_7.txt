"Bend It Like Beckham" may not be very important to us Americans, who know very little about other footballers. For English sports fans, it comes down to "Hit it Like Bonds" or "Dunk it Like Jordan". Any young footballer dreams of placing a ball around a player and in goal for a goal, much like the famous player David Beckham, just like the young Indian Jess (Parminder Nagra), in the movie Bend It Like Beckham. . Jess loves to play soccer, like the one her traditional mother forbids. However, while playing one day, a friend of passage named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees it playing and invites him to try a women's football team entirely itinerant. After satisfying coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she trains the team, which she knows her mother would not approve. The film is not about disobeying parents, but about a girl doing what she wants, even if it goes against the culture, not just the parents. There is humor throughout the film, especially when Jules's mother thinks she's lesbian. The film resorts to a clich√© moment, as the big football match takes place on the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it's not ridiculous, but rather fun and light. Football matches look good, so sports fans will enjoy, and the story of girls growing up in the world of boys, the world of football will inspire some. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about football, it's about a girl trying to find herself and her parents at the same time, which is quite difficult.
