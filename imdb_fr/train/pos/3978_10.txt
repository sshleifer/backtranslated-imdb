I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book "Impossible to find my way home", which is full of information about the drug culture in America, which extends from 1945 to 2000. This guy knows his business !! I found him very good spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching movies from the hippie era and 70s stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. The one who compiled it was really in touch with the tunes of each era. Let's hope they pack them and sell them as CDs. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in how the LSD experiences of the 1960s have forever changed the American culture as we know it. There was no longer any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the film "Blow"), which would be responsible for most of the marijuana and cocaine entering the country in the years 1960-1980.
