I did not expect much from this film. I was given a ticket for advanced screening. I had just come out of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait 40 minutes in the movie queue and there did not seem to be any fresh air in the hallways of the complex. <br /> <br /> Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started I did not recognize any of the actors at first, but the film was perfect. From the beginning, I got used to the movie, more and more excited every minute. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy classic / fairy tale. The actors were fabulous, the rhythm was perfect and the end magical.
