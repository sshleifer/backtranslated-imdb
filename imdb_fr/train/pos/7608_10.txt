I watched the first series greedily, but I wondered if I would return after a long break. However, I listened to episode 1 of series 2 and got hooked again. It's really an excellent TV; Revolutionary stuff like Mission: Impossible in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded and expand as the series progresses, they change as they adapt - some more easily than others - to their new environment, but they remain skilfully strict, and yet it's more than possible to have someone you never thought you could have pity on, when something really overwhelming happens to them. I hope there will be many years of "Lost" to hope for - and it does not really bother me as long as I never have answers to all the mysteries!
