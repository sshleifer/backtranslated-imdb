It's an excellent movie. As a Canadian who has grown up with a rural lifestyle, winter, boating, trapping, hunting, etc., are familiar. It's easy to take the familiar for granted, but after watching this movie several times, it has grown. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians thanks to director Attenborough and screenwriter Nicholson for broadening the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan describes a complex man, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is charming in her first big role. The rest of the distribution is solid.
