Wow, it was a completely captivating film. I could not believe I had started waking up so late to watch it, but it happened late I started to watch it. I could not stop it. Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones, as well as many other well-known actors and actresses. It was more than a glimpse of history, it was an opening to another part of society that people do not know and who might even be embarrassed to speak. I've never heard of a book or movie about it before, and it's something black history never addresses, it only despises them because they're privileged and mestizo, I highly recommend this movie.
