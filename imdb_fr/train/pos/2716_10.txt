All I remember is excellent. Excellent distribution with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before getting better acquainted with the American public). Campion mysteries, but with a Jules Verne touch. A bit like MacGyver would have been in England 80 years earlier ... at the very beginning of the 20th century scientific / technological revolution. <br /> <br /> I often wondered if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver was released for the first time about 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on a very bad tape.
