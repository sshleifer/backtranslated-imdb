Gung Ho is one of those movies you will want to see again and again. Michael Keaton is responsible for persuading a Japanese car company to come to his city, creating jobs for the people of Hadleyville. What happens next is a hilarious moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to stay the course. Seek outstanding performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly molded. Do not be fooled by the low rating. It's a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name of the town of Hadleyville was also used at High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
