Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock find themselves trapped in the ice age of a planet, while Captain Kirk is in colonial times. However, it was the previous pair that had the most difficult time. In addition to the freezing temperatures and sanctuary found only in the caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). While Spock spends more time at this time, he slowly begins to return to the behavioral habits of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction for Zarabeth and throwing "caution in the wind" because he never leaves this place. It is only thanks to Mr. McCoy's constant "reminders" that Spock retains some understanding of reality. <br /> <br /> This is one of the rare moments when the character manages to show "emotion" and Nimoy (Spock). play hard, getting close to knocking out Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Captain Kirk (William Shatner) was not allowed to catch the girl, which was surprising. <br /> <br /> The eternal "old man", Ian Wolfe, interprets the role of "Mr. Atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past.
