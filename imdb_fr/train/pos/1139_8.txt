There are few comedies like this one, where almost all lines and characters are almost perfect. It's so funny !! And there is a lot of satire. Sally Field is at the head of truly exceptional actors and does a good job, if not perfect, with her daytime TV show. Sometimes her game is a bit too big and excessive, but 90% of the time, she is a riot! In the same league, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (which unfortunately has too little to do here). Downey junior may not convince himself quite like a comedian and does not always have the right timing, but he struggles with his role, which, to be honest, is the most ungrateful. But the shining star here is Cathy Moriarty in the role of Celeste, a real bitch if she ever had one with more than one secret villain (you'll see it in the absolutely breathtaking finale!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems to be comfortable enough with her. I normally like Mrs. Shue, but here she acts like a fish out of the water and sometimes seems to be part of a different movie. But it is not harmful and for the most part it is at least sufficient. Otherwise, brimming with lines and memorable situations, it's a comedy to watch on TV or elsewhere.
