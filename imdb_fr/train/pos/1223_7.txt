About a year and a half ago, my dad told me about The French Doors. I thought it sounded pretty interesting but I did not try to find it anywhere. About a year ago, I remembered this movie and I thought, "Why not," and I tried to find it on the Internet. finally, after about a week of research, I found it on atomic films. I called my dad on the computer and told him, "Hey dad, I found this scary movie you told me a long time ago!" He smiled at me, turned around and turned off the lights, it was black like black outside the computer screen and told me to look at him. I started well ... Then, when he started to worry about what was happening, I found him very annoying. at the end I pushed back my chair and got up ... it made me jump: P if you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it, because it is worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time, it's always disturbing. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM!
