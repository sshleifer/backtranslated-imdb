The film, was well presented, with the choice of actors wearing their roles to the reality of writing. Many scenes captured the imagination and created a biting nail. The progression of the situations was intelligently written, making me believe that the story was moving in a direction, but that I found a new twist in what I thought was obvious. Too bad we need to advertise.I told many friends to watch for new screenings and I will come back of course.I enjoyed the film landscape and I felt it added to the conspiracies and 'plot. Lively discussions between husband and wife (or should I say, fights?) Were very realistic. The initial situation is common but the escalation in the story presented happily is not. I want to thank everyone who participated in this great entertainment movie. Thank you! Looking forward to the next films - when? Whidbey
