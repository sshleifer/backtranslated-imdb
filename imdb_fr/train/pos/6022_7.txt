Zabriskie Point, often misunderstood, is the political film of Antonioni, Antonioni's American film. After "Blow-Up", it fits stylistically, which means that the pace is faster than previous epics, although it is certainly no less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> The main mistake is that the movie glorifies the hippie generation. Not so. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists come from very different environments. Mark of the young "rebels", Daria of a real estate agency. But in the Antonioni fashion, they are both alienated, both trying to escape their environment. Mark leaves a meeting of rebellious students and Black Panthers disappointed by empty, verbose rhetoric, while Daria continues to move with her car. <br /> <br /> Antionioni, the main director, after portraying the rebellious youth as confused and shallow, then moves to the city. An environment saturated with corporatism, billboards, nonsense, which must continue to develop to adapt to the same expansion of the population, while generating a profit. It is in this environment that the two protagonists escape, although it seems rather by chance. <br /> <br /> Indeed, when Daria stops near a small village on the edge of the desert, the environment is just as stuffy. and people like misguided cases, illustrated by an old boxing champion, now reduced to a shadow of himself, sitting drinking and smoking and talking nonsense. An amazing melancholic sequence, made even more powerful by the inclusion of some half-wild children living nearby, brought by a "benefactor" but "destroying a true piece of American history". In a not-so-obscure symbolism, there is Antonioni's opinion of hippies. Just a half positive glimpse of the web of human alienation. <br /> <br /> And then, there is the desert, the landscape used for devastating purposes, alternately pure and terrifying, primordial, wild and dead. The sequence in which the two protagonists make love, "joining" in the imagination of the "flower" generation, reflects the similar sequence in "Red Desert", where Giuliana tells a story to her son. It is a colorful intermission in a colorless landscape. A half fantasy bursting into a suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The end probably belongs to the pantheon of the great ends of cinema, Western civilization torn apart. A catharsis, an exorcism. <br /> <br /> Antionioni's two "international" films (the British "Blow-Up" and the "American Zabriskie Point") are less effort than the previous masterpieces, but c the pace faster and inevitably artificial settings (swing London, floral America). But in the end, it's clear he did not lose the advantage.
