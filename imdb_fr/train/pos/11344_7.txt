Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw this at the cinema at the age of 4 and I have a very alive and alive memory. Seeing this as an adult captures references that exceed the expectations of the target audience - such as the piece where Jimmy's Gray Witch Wig is torn apart and Witch Hazel (Cass) sneers "I knew she had brown roots! " It is of course strongly influenced by the flower culture of the time and in some respects quite progressive. The title, Different, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers, saying that it is oneself, that we do not run with the pack and that we love what is different from you. This could be a hymn for the gay community, it should be, an excellent song. <br /> <br /> Martha Raye, Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all excellent as witches, and the casting of Living Island is full of the limits of their character costumes (includes Billy Barty, Felix Silla and others famous names). There are LOTS of over-actors in this film - there is really nothing subtle about it, and when little Jack Wild has to express his concern for the kidnapped inhabitants of Living Island, it's just more than shouting. It's a drama and a comedy that trowel. Although I think about it, I have never been able to stand the flute. <br /> <br /> I like the soundtrack, especially that of Different, but also the one mentioned above, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild. What's more, the CD has been released on CD by El Records' tasteful people in London. See here for more information: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
