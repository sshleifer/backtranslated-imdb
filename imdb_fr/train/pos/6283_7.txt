As much as I love the big epic photos - I spare you the name chosen - it's great to relax with a few beers and a simple action movie from time to time. Movies where the plot takes the back seat. Films where the dialogue is not so well written that it attaches to infinite knots of purple prose. There are hundreds of movies that fit the bill ... but in my opinion, Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the best. <br /> <br /> This is an update of the movie that bears his name. He also shares the ethics of this image, but not quite his execution. Everything that was great about the original was simplified. What has been streamlined has also been improved with a larger budget. Often, this kind of effort is a recipe for a complete disaster - see the remake of The Italian Job to bluff it - but here, thanks to the cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds. <br /> <br /> The plot and much of the dialogue is not something for which to write on IMDb. Often, you will have scenes where the same line of dialogue comes and goes between the actors, each of them expressing it with different inflections. Many people have found this annoying; I think it raises a smile. Every actor has the opportunity to show his style definition here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course (and it's worth noting that it's also fun to see that Mrs. Pitt is not mentioned here in first). The chemistry between the good old Saint Nick the pillar (see the revision date) and Angelina leads to some nice moments. <br /> <br /> The villain does not even look a bit scary - I saw Chris Eccleston play Before, I knew he could cope with it, but I think he was deliberately invited to make his role incoherent so as not to distract from the action. We know that heroes will succeed, one way or another; we are just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think a lot of these scenes were played with the tongue until it went over the heads of many people, which gave a bad rating. In fact, I would not want the camera to be broken by a wink at the fourth wall: it's just that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> All this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed * just * then - would be useless if the action was not there. And for the most part, it is. Marvelously well. I noticed that there seems to be a common tendency to use extremely fast extreme close-ups to direct action nowadays. Personally, I find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension by violating all the time. I was told that Cage had done so many stunts that he could get away without losing his confidence (in real life, I mean - his character does not really care) and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle, which is put to use in the slow climatic finale where he drives a Mustang into the ground in the strangest and most fun way possible. <br /> <br /> So yes, this film is not an "epic" effort to assert one's life after 9/11, with mandatory social commentary. The pace is uneven, some scenes could have been cut and all the actors did not pull the line. But car movies rarely come better than that. So, if you hate cars ... why are you reading these comments ?! <br /> <br /> I would repeat the many iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" every day. 7/10
