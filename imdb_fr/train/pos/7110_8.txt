John Garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade as he struggles on Guadalcanal and must learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical notions about blindness and he is sure he will be a burden to everyone. The hospital staff and his wounded Marine companions can not reach him. Her daughter at home can not be played by Eleanor Parker either. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, his own pity and his prejudices. It's a complex role that Garfield brilliantly wears in a superb performance that allows you to watch in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where he is in a nest of machine guns trying to repel Japanese soldiers advancing in a night battle of hell, and later a dream sequence at the hospital where he sees himself in the process of get off a train dock with a white cane, black glasses and a tin cup while letting his girlfriend get away from the camera.
