It is universally recognized that the episode of Kolchak, They were it, they will be, it will be a great symmetry, whether it is a scam or a tribute is a subject of controversy. As a great fan of both series, I subscribe to this last conviction, although the less charitable may not do so. James Whitmore had the courage to take on the task of leading such a difficult episode. Invisible elephants and gorilla costumes seemed a recipe for disaster, but he came out in style, the teaser being a real gem. Lance Guest does a great job creating a credible character from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader marvels at Ed Meecham. Forget the dubious originality of Symmetry's fearful and enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X file.
