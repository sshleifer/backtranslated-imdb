The plot: A crime lord is assembling 3 different mafias in a company to buy an island, which would then serve as a money-laundering center for organized crime. To counter this, the FBI is trying to dismantle one of the mafia lords. The thing goes wrong, and by some unlikely twists, we are presented another movie "Cops of cops who do not love each other" ... one being an agent of the FBI, and the other a former DEA agent. . <br /> <br /> So far, so stupid. But the strength of this film does not lie in its story - a bad joke, at best. It's funny. (At least the synchronized German version is). The action is good too, with a memorable scene featuring a shotgun and a rocket launcher. But the emphasis is squarely on humor. No intelligent satire, not quite awesome, but somewhere in between, you get a lot of fun jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse occupies an important place, without criticism, and even showing that it is cool. It's the piece of the movie that really bothered me and makes it unusable for kids, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, to spend a good evening watching an acceptable action with some fun jokes, this movie is perfect. Remember: in this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / television room. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
