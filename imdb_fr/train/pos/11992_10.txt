Since I remember, I loved planes and flying. I am now in college with a private pilot license and am looking to become a commercial. I never remembered why I was so obsessed with the subject until I stumbled upon my old Tail Spin cassettes in my basement at home and that strikes me, that's all. My parents bought all the tapes they had and it was the only show I watched when I was a kid. I had the memorized theme growing up and I can still quote it today. It's absolutely amazing and I plan to buy the DVD soon! It's really great for kids and adults and is absolutely timeless. I can not get tired of this show.
