After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that has something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still OK. Morgan Freeman was just like God. Jennifer Aniston had a good time. I miss Steve Correll in "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like director Tom Shadyac's film choices. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three and in almighty Bruce, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets and tell a meaningful and intelligent story is hard to come by. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they should have used more Biblical references. I only remember three specific Bible references and these were the three funniest parts of the film. I suppose the early versions of the script contained more Bible references, but they were removed because the producers were afraid of offending people. It's a shame because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My rating: <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
