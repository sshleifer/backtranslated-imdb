This has long been one of my favorite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although it is definitely not part of the spectacular movie "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively faithful television version of Austen's novel, especially given its short duration. The biggest change between the novel and the film is good, since the useless snobbery presented by Austen at the end of the story is removed here and replaced by a character much more akin to Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters chosen to represent the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale distinguishes between femininity and the social snob with a completely lost grace in Gwyneth Paltrow's version of 96. Samantha Morton's vaporous blonde highlights match her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterizations is replaced by the Harriet we know in the book. Mr. Knightly's role is extremely good in my opinion; the seriousness and gentle compassion with which the hero is painted in the novel are present here in this sumptuous and neglected film.
