Having watched this film strictly on the basis of the ratings of the critics, I was pleasantly surprised. Although it is clearly small budget, it bears the marks of ingenious ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in the strange house and looks out the window, I thought that her feeling of isolation would be reinforced by an outside shot centered on her face, then backing away to include the house and its isolated location. There you go! the next scene was exactly that of the last picture of the house, isolated on the cliff at the edge of the water. There are other examples of how an intelligent director can elevate his film to the level of a very nice thriller. Well-informed viewers will surely spot them, but rest assured that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> As for performances, George Macready is his usual frightening character, barely keeping his calm while suggesting a capacity for absolute violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a savvy worker who does not want to submit without a fight. But Lady May Witty, oh my God, she even made me doubt with my own eyes and believe that she could get away with her evil plans. <br /> <br /> This is a real rough diamond and not to be missed.
