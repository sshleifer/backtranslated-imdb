The film has a distinct humanity (though brutal and rough) for all its depravity to the limit - the zipped / lyrical score emphasizes the comic side of their misadventures, and even when they are at their greatest agony), a vulnerability to half pitiful never hides (Dewaere sucks her tits like a baby). Blier cuts the scene where Depardieu is about to rape Dewaere. We do not know exactly how to interpret the obviously homoerotic aspect of their relationship. Anyway, this incident is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the film could definitely be read as a pro-gay, although it could probably be read as anything you want). The film has many questionable scenes and sexual politics and it's probably best to take it as a general caricature about the weaknesses of both genders, mocking the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty and hitting many points of possible depth. if you shoot enough, some are doomed to hit.
