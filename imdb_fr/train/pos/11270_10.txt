Do not get me wrong, Maureen O'Sullivan is without a doubt the most beautiful Jane, and there will never be any again. She is visually beautiful. That said, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. It's a very good film. It has not only the classic aura of Tarzan, but also the sensation of the saga that continues. We mingle with two white hunters in search of ivory, one in love with Jane, the other, a spooky catalyst whose character is perhaps one of the best defined and best examined in history the cinema. Super action movie stand out as a classic. There is the uncomfortable racism that is described. However, Africans are described as individuals and, in the end, two of them become even more heroic than white hunters and stand out as such. In fact, the unnamed one probably evokes more sympathy on the part of the public than any other character. The finale is also one of the reasons to enjoy this film. The big lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implicated in the characters' reactions, more than would a modern gore movie with a graphic representation. If I omitted something, it's because I do not want to smear the image for those who have not seen it. But that's all you could want in a movie.
