Who made this movie? I like this film? Someone has a wacky sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This crazy and surreal style of filming is appealing, but it's hard to create - or easy to forget - this stuff and the characters who really have a soul, are what gives such a depth of film. Without that, a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. We do not care. It can make you laugh, but it crosses you like a half-good hamburger ... then ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed may not have the intention to change the life of anyone but I appreciate its depth and substance. They sneak on you. I started this movie thinking "Oh, I understand - independent comedy - on the wall - gonzo ... yeah." And that's it - but if you pay attention, there are moments of subtext and character that complement it. In this sense, the film breathes. He makes proposals that give pause - if you are available to see them - and then, of course, that continues his incredibly joyful way. <br /> <br /> You will miss the point if you do not sign the contract of suspension of belief at certain times of the film. Taking a step between reality and surreality is one of the highlights of this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but smart people did it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the dining room are an absolute hero. <br /> <br /> Put on your seatbelt.
