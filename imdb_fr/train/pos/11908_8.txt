This film plays really well with an audience. Especially once the hunt begins. In addition, Trevor Howard with his intelligent and intelligent charms and Jean Simmons with his innocent behavior and piercing eyes are great. <br /> <br /> The film begins as a psychological drama, but after the murder, it turns into a hunting thriller. both lead to the border. Some people may think that hunting is superfluous, but in reality hunting is essential because it helps to clear up the spirit of Jean Simmons's character by bringing her out of the oppressive house, in addition to bringing out the real killer - who is suddenly placed in such a position that they must finish the job. The killer was right to believe that once Simmons's character stopped, she would be fired. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing her way forward - she would have no way to evade the murder charge. The ensuing lawsuit brings out the truth. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining film. Look for it if you can find it.
