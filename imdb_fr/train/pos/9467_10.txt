I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE thanks to the excellent reviews and the thirst for a well-written drama - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell plays in the movie, you know that an audience will be like in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a very entertaining and rewarding performance. DAN IN REAL LIFE kept this promise. <br /> <br /> The film is so real for many families around the world who have lost a limb and yet have gone on to search for something that gives them back some magic. before their loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so well made and written that their scenes were so true for their characters and their travels. The cast, the sets and the story have made DAN IN REAL LIFE an unforgettable memory as the holidays approach.
