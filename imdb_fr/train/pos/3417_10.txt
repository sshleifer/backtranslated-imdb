Before seeing this, the subject was off the mark, but it's not your average victory over the history of adversity. Although technically Tibetan blind children climb the mountain. Everest, there is so much more than that. This film shows the very strong and often contradictory personalities of two very accomplished blind adults driving the children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is a blind American climber / athlete and Sabriye is a blind German scholar who opened a school in Lhasa, Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own way, but do not agree on what will really boost children's confidence. Erik wants them to reach the top while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a model and take pleasure at a time. The nuances are complicated and we move away without really knowing who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a good idea. The deepest scenes are those of the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before going to school. Most touching for me was the story of Tashi, a fragile teenager who grew up on the street after his parents abandoned him. I could watch an entire movie about his life and was happy to learn that, thanks to the school, he now runs a successful small business with some of his classmates. If you liked Spellbound or Murderball, you'll love it.
