This will be another type of review. I have seen this film twice on television and I would like to have a copy of it, because it talks about the city of Panama and the beach in winter, which is my favorite time to be there. This is the first movie I saw by Ashley Judd. She was great and I enjoyed all the things I had seen her. Sundance's reaction also impressed me, as did director Victor Nunez, who directed and wrote several films about Florida. This film speaks to me and I have not seen anything with which to compare it. The plot speaks to me less than the surroundings. Well, I told you it would be a different type of review.
