I went looking for this film in the obsession type of fans. I just wanted to check. I did not expect much. After all, a musician, an actor and a screenwriter? Impossible for so much talent to reside in one person. Right?? <br /> <br /> False !! Obsession aside, he quickly became one of my favorites! The storyline and the characters are not lost in the special effects typical of Hollywood. The story plucks your emotions and trains you. As the credits progress, you suddenly realize that you have been stuck to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the acting game seems a little excessive. I believe, however, that it was done with a comic intention and very adapted to the character. Otherwise, I would not have expected the level of actor observed. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing more than once. I find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly about something I've forgotten or forgotten first or twice. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Feel free to enter with your doubts, but I'm sure that will find a place on your shelf.
