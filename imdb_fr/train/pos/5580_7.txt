The young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he can not satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Frustrated, she goes home and plans to divorce. Then, one day, she is skinny diving into a lake in the middle of the woods. Her horse gallops with her clothes ... and she runs after! She meets the young and beautiful Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes that it's the man she wants. <br /> <br /> FINAL SPOILER !!!! Of course, since that was done in 1933, she must be punished for her sin so that it leads to a tragic finale. END OF THE SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> This people horrified in 1933, but it is rather tamed by the current standards. Lamarr's bare swim shows nothing and when she runs after the totally naked horse, she is either shown at a very long distance, or covered with branches, etc. There are only a few minor strokes of her breasts. Moreover, when she has sex with Mog, nothing is visible except her face but you see her reach an orgasm. These scenes were considered quite extreme in their day and were totally cut off from the American release. Today, they are back. This film would manage easily with a PG-13. <br /> <br /> Shock episodes aside, it does not matter. It is beautifully filmed and there is almost no dialogue. With the exception of the score, it could be a silent image. Fortunately, all the actors are good - Lamarr and Mog in particular and they are so attractive that they take your breath away by watching them. Moreover, the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautiful filmed and interpreted sequences I have ever seen in a movie. Scenes with sexual symbolism (there are many) are unfortunately quite obvious today. In fact, I started to laugh! <br /> <br /> So, good direction, beautiful imagery, attractive actors, good action game - but I was not really impressed. I found the film slow (beautiful pictures do not make me an image), a little dull, obvious, static and with a negative end. I can live with the end but that does not excuse the other problems I had with it. Plus, the final sequence is REALLY weird - and misplaced. So, I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and I recommend it but with caution. Many people seem to like this movie, so I'm in the minority. Use your own judgment.
