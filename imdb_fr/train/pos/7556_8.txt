Ok, that was a pretty good episode. Much better than the credit he receives. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is beautiful. Better yet. I love this last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are fantastic and the cast of guests (minus the helpless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like in this episode is that many things remain unexplained. why does it change sex? what is the point? and they are extraterrestrials? what kind? why have they never reappeared in recent mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this episode three high stars. One of my favorites for now, but the holes in the plot bother me. Yet ... I will not let that ruin my entertainment.
