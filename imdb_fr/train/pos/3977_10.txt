I personally watched this to see the images of the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement had essentially started and had become a pop culture and ultimate uncompromising force in life. The interviews of classic rock stars are moving and humorous. You feel that you are in the secret and that you shake your head at the same time ... because it is so good and so familiar. I liked it, all segments from 60 to the present day. I highly recommend it for all aspects, including rock music, hipster movement, politics and good story. I check the box indicating that it contains a spoiler, only because I do not know what some might consider a spoiler or not, because I discussed what is in the 4 segments, so I wanted to be safe.
