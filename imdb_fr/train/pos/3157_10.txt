"That '70s Show" is without a doubt the most entertaining show on television. I started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I saw it, I saw that it was an excellent show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also a great character while he was there, I really hope he'll come back because he's hilarious. It's classic when Fez says "you son of a bitch!", And when Kelso shouts "burn!", It always makes me laugh. They are both great characters and always have something fun to say. Jackie being hot is another reason to watch the show; she started out being really pretty but damn, somewhere around season 5-6 she just got really hot. I have seen most episodes more than once, some ten times, and again, they are hilarious. This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over and I still laugh about as much as when I first appeared. The casting is classic; almost everyone is funny, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see this show come to an end next year, but it will be one of the best shows of all time.
