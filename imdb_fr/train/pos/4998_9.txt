Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee, plays very hard in the martial arts in this exhilarating film from Hong Kong and proves that, like her late brother Brandon, she is a real asset in the old quarter. There are high-tech stunts to die for in this fast-paced movie, and Bond filmmakers should watch it if they want to spice up the action quotient of the upcoming 007 adventure, because there are so many innovative things here The second original unit was working to reinforce the already very active content of "AND NOW, YOU ARE DEAD". When you watch a film as animated and entertaining as this, you begin to wonder how cinema could survive before the genre of martial arts was created. I sincerely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular just timed out. The kung fu films debuted. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his surviving legitimate offspring, Shannon, does not leave the family name here. Although there are several enjoyable performances in this film (that of Michel Wong for example), it is Shannon Lee which you will truly remember spectacular performance as Mandy the hitgirl supreme.Hell, you can well come whistling his fights !
