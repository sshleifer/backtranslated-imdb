This is an excellent thriller from Turkey that can make sense. Excellent work of the Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to focus on watching on screen.In general, playing in most Turkish films is not enough, but GEN has the best shots to be said "perfect" . And the transition pieces are really excellent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" has a big topic that influences everyone.Especially a woman, who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanatorium, has a mother who is a usual madness.The main causes and the psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing you need to do is combine all the tips. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive aggression in the role played by Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar. This performance may be more realistic than "Irreversible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you'll be confused"
