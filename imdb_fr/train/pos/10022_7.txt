Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people alive in a mission to Guatemala in the 1970s. He also claimed to have murdered 16 other people (he used to kill pregnant women and then set them on fire). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that describes Aro's personality through several interviews with people who have met him and through scenes performed by actors based on real facts. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious job, so analytical, it is not morbid at all. Such horrible testimony about how childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
