Kurt Russell is so credible and the action so constant that one must think about it later to realize that there were important themes ranging from honest to kindness [overcoming the fear of the unknown, learning to rise above the early conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring, etc.] in the scenario. It's so rare for an action movie that even me [who thinks most A / A is violent] I recommended the movie to all the guys I know ..... it's a pity that it was neglected because, by right, it should have been one of the biggest box-action action-adventure hits - it offers something for everyone without putting a strain on credulity or losing moments almost non-stop action. I fear that the answer to this question does not become a success lies in the fact that the adults did not go to see it. Anyone under the age of 20 has probably not only witnessed more violent actions in their video games, but would probably not be able to catch or be interested in multi-layered and multi-thematic beauty. This film could convert anyone who avoids A / A as blind violence. If a guy takes his lady [or hires her or sees her on a television list] to watch this movie, she'll be much more likely to convince her to accompany her to other action movies.
