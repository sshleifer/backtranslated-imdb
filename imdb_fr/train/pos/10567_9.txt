A wonder. One of the best musicals of all time. The three issues of Busby Berkely that end the film are spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop singing and natural playing of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also adorable, although she may not have been a great actress). There is a freshness in the film that we do not see today in the movies, and even less in the films of the 30s usually stomped, even if the plot, involving the establishment of prologues of the film, is pretty dated.
