For true filmmakers, this film is a must because it works as a small allegory perfect for the movies themselves. The science of Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff consists of capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can hurt or can be exploited to do good. On the one hand, he blinds his mother, on the other, he is used to cure blindness ("I see!" Shouts a girl on whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh / Karloff himself is poisoned by the supernatural power of this light, we actually see him emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face as a poorly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we observe is a projection, entity viewed on a movie (visible only, as in a movie theater, when the lights are off). <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful passage to the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as enlightened by the fact that everything that happens is captured by a light that crosses the space for millions of years. years, as the light of Andromeda was emitted by this galaxy at a time when the Earth was still melting. <br /> <br /> There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed with older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the character of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblematized in the sculptural figures of the local cathedral, Karloff explodes with his projector / ray gun. <br /> <br /> We must ask ourselves here if this film was intended to take a look at what was happening in Germany at that time, and in particular about the use of the film by Riefenstall the year before to to promote a regime that would certainly last a long time: Triumph of the will. <br /> <br /> Fortunately at the end, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes to remind Janos Rukh the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If only more movies made you want to get up at the theater and shout, "I can see!"
