"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that slyly dubs pop culture to the point of being described in a humorous way. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh / sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I love most ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s / early 40s who created an editorial magazine pop culture-themed "The Next Big Thing". The magazine does not exist, it is only an excuse for Simon to get closer to the actors by interviewing them, only to slap them, insult them, insulting their way of registering in the pop culture. Living girlfriend, Darla, also writes a magazine (which is real), which mainly deals with her and Simon, as well as her and her father.Darla is a truly adorable character (or not), depending on how you see her neurotic behavior muted Magda is a prostitute, the character I most loved.Brent is a flat character who does not have much of it, just like Tedra, the queen of music video for a group of rock bands rated B. Yet these characters weave together a very interesting canvas, and this film questions all the motivations of people for what they do and why they do it. suggest to see him if you are in the crowd of indie artists pendants / art house Mark my words! <br /> <br />
