I was lucky to see this during a pre-screening last night (October 20th) and I was incredibly surprised by the fantastic plot and the heart really acted. <br /> <br /> While the plot is not particularly complicated or unusually new, the story unfolds in a fresh, unique and distinctly "indy" way. It's not something that can easily be compared to the movies of the past, it's a unique interpretation of some kind of classic middle-aged depressed love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly struck by the cast of the film. . Until the last extras of the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. The three girls did a great job, the talent was equally divided among them and none of them "outperformed" the other two. <br /> <br /> It was really a charming film, suitable for all ages and funny laughing while being really touching and comforting. It was a wonderful break with the sexual jokes and nudity of recent movies.
