First of all, I really liked the central idea of ​​locating the "intruders", the Others in the fragile self, on different levels - mainly subconscious but sometimes more allegorical. In fact, intruders are omnipresent throughout the film: on the Franco-Swiss border where the pretagone leads a secluded life; in his reverie daydream and recurring nightmare; inside his sick body after a heart transplant .... In the last half of the movie, he becomes himself an intruder, returning to the former French colony in the hope of expiating the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is bitter rather than pathetic, full of regrets and blunders, the feeling of failure being more or less dominant. It's a pretty dark picture of old age, supposedly self-dependent, but desperately empty and lonely inside. The director composes the images more to convey transient feelings of anguish and desire than explicit meanings. Some of them are fascinating, but not devoid of humor. It's a kind of absurd game that only a sleepwalker can visualize.
