This film was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Beautiful and simple writing, nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, which traces the daily life of Ruby. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Role for this role. Ruby begins to live alone and establish her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, friends, sex, typical research of young adults. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film buff, I chose the film because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of film because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it reminded me of Nobody's Fool, looking at Paul Newman. The last film is a slice of the everyday life of an ordinary man. I like this. The story is very well told and all we had to do was sit back and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure of is the title. I'm sure there are not many insects and fly to paradise as in Florida. As I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a paradise for me, I'm itching to think of Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, performed by Allison Dean strolling on the beach in Panama City, Florida. Indeed the sand is very white. I was there. Favorite Quotes: "The need has always been a good excuse." "All these problems related to looking for a man are not at all different, who will be, when and why." <br /> <br />
