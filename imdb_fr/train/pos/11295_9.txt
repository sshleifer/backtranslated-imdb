This film has always been one of my favorite films since I first saw it at the age of 12 in 1962, when it was screened in "The Late Show" of the TV channel. Los Angeles. The characters are very endearing from the beginning of the image and it is unfortunate that the film was never broadcast on video tape and it is never broadcast on television (apparently due to a ban on the estate of Moss Hart, the playwright / producer / director who wrote the story and first introduced it to the New York scene during the Second World War - it's hard to understand why we refuse to broadcast it more 50 years after its creation). I have not seen the film for more than 30 years, when a major actor of the film managed to get me a copy "bootlegged" on VHS (poor video quality, but good sound). I remembered it well: it was always a fascinating and fascinating film to watch. An astonishing aspect of this film is that many of its stars, who started in the career at the time of 1944, have become either major film stars, or at least well-known and fully-employed actors (eg , Judy Holliday, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman"), Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the B-24 Liberators are fantastic, especially the close-ups where you can see the details of the giant (for the time) 4-engine bomber (then manufactured more than 18,000 copies, now almost extinct) ). Good overview of the different training levels followed by a cadet pilot before being assigned to a bomber crew (of course, VERY biased by gender, as was the case with the day's trend: only the MEN are become pilots, supported them in their roles - hardly acceptable in the world today). I hope that one day it will be broadcast on video for the pleasure of a new generation.
