Antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic, that "Blow up". It was not the success of critics and youth like the old ones. Why? Perhaps because it was a European vision of America filled with clich√©s that did not work at the time and had not aged well. (The revolutionary students at the beginning are embarrassing.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps after its release, the big hit movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed out of date. If it had been released a year ago, maybe the hippes in the deserts would have seemed fresh ... This is a very interesting film, but very well filmed with some brilliant and antonionic scenes between them, like the love in the desert, the calm of the desert manor and explosive end ... That the tracks were two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would have been so much better with appropriate actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is actually quite funny and poignant sometimes, but you would not know how the lines are delivered ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting document from the late sixties is really worth a look for photography and the soundtrack ....
