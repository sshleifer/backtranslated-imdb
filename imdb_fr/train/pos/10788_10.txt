Big Rock Candy Candy is amazing. I watched it when I was little and I still do it today (in high school). if I could imagine paradise, that's what it would look like. I wish I could live in the big rock candy mountain where candies grow on trees. Zach Hyman is a teacher and he is my best friend. the little rabbit foo foo is the man. it is so vague and colorful that I dream at night. In fact, my 18-year-old friend recently watched it for the first time and loved it. I recommend that people of all ages watch this movie. I'm having a big party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie. we will order a pizza and watch the teddy bears laugh. I find myself constantly looking at the clouds and wishing to be this little girl who had the opportunity to visit. Thank you. goodbye.
