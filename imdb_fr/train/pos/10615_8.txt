The Unseen is in a style that looks more like the old Hollywood mystery than a horror show. The film is a bit slow but many weird pictures keep it alive and visible. The basic idea of ​​girls stalked by something in the basement is old, but a good interpretation and good production make the film worth watching. The film is notable for its emotional impact and certainly for no explicit action or special effect. I rated it 8 out of 10.
