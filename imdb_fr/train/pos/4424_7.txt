As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is a cartoon-inspired action movie inspired by Hong Kong, with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively represented by the protagonist (an excellent actor's work directed by Daisuke Ryu), a killer turned Boddhist monk, Benkei. Benkei has vowed never to kill again, but he always takes the sword to fight what he sees as an invasion of demons ... <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a difficult film to evaluate. Her visual imagery is incredibly neat and beautiful, but she uses too much cunning (bulky cameras and high-speed controls, expressionist shots, leaning colors, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is a little tiring. That said, the beginning and the end of the film are nevertheless both elegant and powerful. If only the director Sogo Ishii would have had the wisdom not to abuse his bag malice. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such a violent message, Gojoe wastes too much energy and time on the screen to represent endless battle scenes. In addition, the way in which violence is shown is always on the verge of self-indulgence; in fact, a shower of blood in the night sky seems to be one of the emblematic images of the film. Fortunately, Ishii has the wisdom to also show the ugly and tragic side of the violence. Yet it seems that Ishii does not know if he is making a traditional action movie or a deeply moral allegory. The public can not be sure either until the very end of the film. The powerful end (though cynical) is what saves Gojoe; he clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a festive party.
