It's a good ending for the show. The fact that Admiral Janeway was able to make a double change on the Borg was great. The fact that she let herself be infected, thus transmitting to the queen a "poison" which, in essence, put an end to the Borg, was formidable. The way they ended the film also left, not a lot, a reunion movie. However, they brought them back "home" and the way they did it was fantastic !! It was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. In ending with Tom and B'Lanna having their baby just as they enter the Alpha Quadrilateral. was a great way to show a new beginning. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some sort - just to see where their characters would be.
