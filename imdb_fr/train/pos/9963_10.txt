I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I enjoyed every time. Of course, the graphics are a little tacky, compared to now, but in the 70s it was great. I saw it in the original Spanish version only and thought it was wonderful. That's how I remembered that my Christmas was with my family - magic. Santa was amazing and I could not wait for him to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child and speak Spanish, bring them to this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version of the one we're used to today, but who says there is a solution? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. He teaches children good against evil. I do not know how the English subtitled version is or if there is one in English, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and have a good holiday! Feliz Navidad!
