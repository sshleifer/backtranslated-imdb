Johny To is doing one of his best style exercises here, making a strong film with a good Yakuza story. The election of the new president of Yakuza marks the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, violence is judiciously used in context, making it a very powerful movie about gangs. I particularly like the way he tells the story, going through all the roles within the Yakuza family and making sure we see violence as the only way they can solve their problems ... > <br /> Talking On the technical side, the film is a good example of a filmed, planned and rhythmic shoot. One of the Hong Kong movies of the year. It's like hellish business, but without the easy scenes of action-violence, and the confused scenario. Highly recommended to all lovers of Asian movies. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my english, better to do it in spanish lol)
