I am a writer and I work at home. Diagnosis Murder is my lunchtime companion - good, pure pleasure, good humor and nostalgia for the time of the show Dick van Dyke. How innocent were we all (and how good is the diagnosis Murder Diagnosis innocent)? I particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgic characters like Joe Mannix. The bad guys are always caught, the good ones continue. The stars clearly have fun and sway without taking themselves too seriously. <br /> <br /> One ox: why were so many bad guys women or at least sluts? Amanda was dizzy too. It's hard to imagine doing something as macabre as an autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we have not seen the last episode of Dick Van Dyke and his family on our screens, in particular. at lunch time !!
