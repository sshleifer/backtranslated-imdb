Captivating and captivating account of the camouflage of the captured American army, which must prove its innocence to avoid the executioner. Paul Ryker avoids friendly fire in an apparently doomed attempt to convince a military court that he is in fact an American spy on the secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> According to the court's classic dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well done mystery, cleverly guided by an exceptional cast, Kulik's constant dynamism and effective twists. <br /> <br /> This film was shot on television in 1964, then reinforced for this review with the presence of many actors "name", and some sequences of actions. Dillman, taking over his role, is the dubious defense attorney, whose attentions sometimes go to the personal distress of Ryker's wife, who supports, but who is a little distant, and who plays with Vera Miles' assertiveness. Peter Graves, in charge of the pursuit, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton play the lead role. <br /> <br /> Marvin's portrayal of Paul Ryker's character is a balanced representation of a simple yet devoted man whose behavioral return is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed. Marvin passes perfectly from resigned indifference to passionate determination, giving a convincing performance, often intense, which is the highlight of this drama also small scale. It is this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a prominent place in the best series of plays. <br /> <br /> However, despite its apparent darkness, the "Sergeant Ryker" still remains tense and compelling examination, like a book that you simply can not file. Highly recommended.
