Why can not current filmmakers create horror movies like "The Shining"? The answer to this question is simple: modern administrators are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick proved once and for all with this film that he is truly one of the greatest directors and writers of all time. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and his family settle down in a large, isolated hotel to watch him during the off-season. The kickoff is that the former guardian of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two daughters. The following may very well be summed up by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first film for a long time to sound "scary". "These are things seriously ruined, but in a good way, one of the things that adds to the fear factor is the music Music was an important part of Kubrick's (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, to name a few) films, and he certainly does not disappoint with this one. and this film would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance.Jack is terribly convincing as a mad killer.In fact, his look steals a few scenes from this movie It's a quality action game that has to be seen as such. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror movie that looks like this: RIP Stanley.
