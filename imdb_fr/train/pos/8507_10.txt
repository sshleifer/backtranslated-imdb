Well, you take OJ As an American soldier, Simpson became an American bus driver who decides to save himself his passengers, in case nobody goes there and Arte Johnson in a perfectly straightforward role as tour guide who does not know what to do but does not do it. I do not want to admit that they have problems and combine that with Lorenzo Lamas as one of the three bad boys facing evil who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a bus filled with people dying on the dessert and that you must have action, twists and a lot of drama. Everyone was good but seeing Lamas as the meanest of the bad boys really turned my head upside down. He was far too credible as a wicked rogue who wanted not only to kidnap the heiress, but to rape women and humiliate the guy who was trying to stop him. It was obviously long before he cultivated his good image of guys. And believe me, Lorenzo, 20, in skinny jeans not to be missed!
