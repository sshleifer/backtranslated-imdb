I just can not accept the comment above - it has many interesting and amazing cinematic images in it. It has an unusual structure and is well advanced to a frightening dramatic sequence that is characterized by an effective use of silence. What is more, he explores very frankly the impulse of the suicide, not pulling the fists in what he shows, without however insisting on the subject and making it sensationalist. he has allusions to a documentary on this subject, as well as to a horror and art cinema, and deserves a place among the singers of "different" horror films such as The Blair Witch Project and the Ring. original (of which it is previous and could influence unrecognized on). It is really worth it if you are interested in the limits of horror cinema.
