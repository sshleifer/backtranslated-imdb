Wow, I can not believe I waited so long to see this movie. I never had time to look at it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I do not know anything about football (football). I'm one of those American fools who has no idea. I had never even seen David Beckham before this movie. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film when it was released in America. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> To tell the truth, it was a mistake to ignore this little bit of cinematic paradise. What a fun movie. It's full of color and exuberance. I had an awkward smile all along the movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and adorable that you can not help but take her for her. No wonder the American television series E.R. captured it. I have a new appreciation of Indian culture. These people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had to solve was to decipher some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents. I turned on English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (This is not a film review!) I'm sure audiences around the world are struggling to understand the ever-evolving slang of American movies. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. He has a great sporting plot like Rocky and a strong feminism that gives power to women. I watched it with my wife and my 16 year old niece and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
