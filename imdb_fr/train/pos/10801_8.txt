Honestly, when I saw this film years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. As I sat for about 10 minutes, I realized that the actor playing the role of Navin had stolen the show. His facial expressions and comic behavior make me shake my head to know WHY he has not done more comedies. He has this "Marty Feldman" thing for him, but MUCH, MANY more talent ... without taking anything away from Marty. The movie really shocked me to see how close it was to the original Jerk, but it was still MUCH MORE. I really think that if this film came out first and I saw the movie Steve Martin second, I think the second was a cheap scam. I know it sounds like a bold statement, but it's true. I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is the second of the actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I could get a copy for my collection. I urge you to see it if you can find it.
