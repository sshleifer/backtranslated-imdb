I consider this film to be the best of Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's final performance, Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's screenplay is excellent and contains many improvements to Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he makes good use of light and shadows. John Alton's work on the camera is excellent, as is Franz Waxman's score. The cast includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable rendition of Charlotte Manning. In summary, this is one of the best private eye movies ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have had more opportunities. I always liked this movie.
