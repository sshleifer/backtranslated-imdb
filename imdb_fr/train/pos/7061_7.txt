Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it is composed of 3 stories, but hey, so what ?! I thought it was good to be honest. In fact, I liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, it shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> I also liked the voice of Cinderella. I have nothing against his voice in the original, but I just think it sounds better here, nicer. Her personality also pleased me, she had more spine, but she was always kind. <br /> <br /> I will give to Cinderella II: Dreams come true 7/10.
