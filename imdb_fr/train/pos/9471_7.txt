Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, uncle agony of the newspaper and devoted single father of three girls. In a large family back home, Dan meets his perfect wife and discovers that she is in relationship with her brother. <br /> <br /> What must a man do? <br /> <br /> I rather liked "Dan In Real Life", but I imagine that the success of this film will depend on the fact that you are ready to accept that Steve Carell plays a relatively straight and moderate role, rather than going through the big comedy gestures that made him so successful. If you can not accept it, do not be afraid, "Get Smart" will follow later this year, but for the record, I found it very good. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" begins as your typical family drama, a lot of fun by the way, but it gets more and more funny as Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only see movies with original ideas, the cinematic choices would be very rare, is not it?), But "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining and is a good distribution (who would not fall in love with the luminous Juliette Binoche?), enjoy a sufficiently insightful scenario that contains many reflections on the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell something so interesting again.
