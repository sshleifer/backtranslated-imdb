big fan of Ramones. I love Ramones, and I suppose if you hate them, then, in addition to being a fervent supporter of Bush, you may not like this classic. <br /> <br /> he is immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen movie and the like that spoiled the 80s. infinitely better than the American pie that torments us now. <br /> <br /> There are other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High and corny but striking (does not seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and the funniest. In addition, you can get up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10 / ten
