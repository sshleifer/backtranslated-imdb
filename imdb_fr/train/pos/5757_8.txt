This film could only come from the 1970s !! It's a weird action movie taking place in a small town of California workers. A sort of mill or factory is closing down, so suddenly, widespread bad behavior occurs in the streets! City dwellers are fed up! Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another city to recruit his brother, Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a veterinarian from Vietnam who looks and acts a little unbalanced. He hangs out with a lot of other vexed veterinarians from Vietnam. They come to the city to clean it up (they become substitutes), but under their good deeds, they run gambling houses asking for protection money, and so on. !!! It takes a while for people to understand, and in a biblical confrontation between Cain and Abel, Vincent has to face his older brother. There is an interesting blue-collar sleaze atmosphere in this movie, which makes it interesting (note the cock fight scene!). Vincent is almost too angelic in this role ?? he has such esteem for his brother that he can not conceive of him committing the evil deeds of which he is accused. He finally comes to his senses ?? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally hit on the back and he is beaten at home. Kris Kristofferson is frighteningly effective as Aaron. He coldly denies any reprehensible act, and even softly, coos and talks to Vincent's girl (she calls him "Uncle Aaron") even though he was threatening his father's life while smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have good chemistry that contrasts. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a 'saloon' girl who catches Aaron's attention. It's a good action movie from the 70's, if you can find it !! This is not yet available on DVD ??
