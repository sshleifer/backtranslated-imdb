It's probably the best documentary I've seen in a long time. Jonny Kennedy was and still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only did he survive one of the most painful diseases in the world, but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never give up on reaching people and spreading love. Watching minutes of his long fight was heartbreaking. Listening to his intelligent remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was comforting. And seeing him smile was indescribable. I feel lucky to have been touched by this little giant. Please, if you have the chance to watch this movie, consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy.
