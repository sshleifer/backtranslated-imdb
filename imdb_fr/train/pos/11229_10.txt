With the number of actors they have on the project, they have a wide variety of actors. Beautiful CGI spaceship in some places BUT their green screen needs work. Anyone who has heard of Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it for better typing. <br /> <br /> The stories are well thought out, there are many elements of trekking in this area to keep it in the right context. BUT BUT the idea of ​​two guys kissing me makes me advance the episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can not help thinking that men kiss each other in an entertaining way (do not worry about women). Anyway ... For a series of fans, it's good. With a slight improvement in their green screen, an actor brushing and some guiding clues, this series is amazing. Anyway, I recommend this series to those who have already appreciated TNG and DS9.
