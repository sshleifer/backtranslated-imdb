I do not know what I find so endearing about this film, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or war dramas, but I really wondered how and when Winfield would find his child. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. Actually, I have not seen this film for years and it has not been shown on television for a while, but this film is a bit of a man's odyssey after the war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and comforting portrait of a man lost in his memories. There is an underlying message in this film that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality he is facing. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
