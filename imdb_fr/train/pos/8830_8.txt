This is a masterpiece film in 35mm B / W film. The movie makes you see a strange way to start the day in a bar at 7:35 and everything can happen there in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The short film makes you enter into a complex story using very few elements and step by step make you realize that something is not quite right. It expresses a lot, makes your adrenaline rush with subtle details and is incredibly understandable for everyone, not just for movie reviewers. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: short European, black and white and low budget. Do not let that scare you. This is really worth seeing by everyone, not just the experts of the genre. <br /> <br /> Is not really much more to say, since the film lasts only 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to Spit it. But I just watched it online and I did not understand why nobody took a few minutes to post a comment about it. <br /> <br /> It's really worth watching. 10/10.
