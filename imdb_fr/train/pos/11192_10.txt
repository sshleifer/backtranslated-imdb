I have watched this film many times here at university, and every time I show it, the number of people watching me with me increases exponentially ... in addition to the virgins, everyone to whom I have already shown it NEED to see it again! It takes a while to get in, but in the end, the whole room screams, screams, screams, rewinds the scenes repeatedly, repeats the dialogue and is completely absorbed by the cinema experience of Pia Zadora in " The lonely lady! "" Scene after scene, scene after scene of the film that is the least well filmed, the least written, the least horribly played, TRASH is thrown at the assault of every moment, which makes it the most animated I own (not a small statement, friends) .For me, nothing beats 2 U, Pia ... and I guess I'm not the only one to have felt that!
