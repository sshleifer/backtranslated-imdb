This film is fantastic. Finally, well-written characters that you can love for all their advantages and disadvantages. Pierce Brosnan is completely hysterical in this erased role. I think it's the best thing he's ever done. He played other roles that seemed to be able to achieve this type of work in its own right, but this role finally gave him the opportunity to run with it. I almost died crossing the hotel lobby, wearing his underwear and his boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a couple to aspire too, as well as actors to aspire too. Kinnear is so clumsy that his turn in the end is really rewarding. You give good work to good actors and they give us something more in return.
