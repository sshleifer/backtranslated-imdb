The main problem of the first movie "Vampires" is that none of the characters were nice. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a friendly vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. Vampire Una is certainly the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, although there are good concepts like a slow-motion restaurant scene (why did not Carpenter use more?), This movie is not nearly as good as it could have been be. I was expecting to see strong vampires in action and at least a longer, well-choreographed fight sequence (for example inside a city) and I was a little disappointed. While "Los Muertos" is moving at a faster pace than his predecessor, he is still hanging around in some parts (although it's not nearly as bad as "Vampires"). It sounds a lot like "Vampires", but the highlight of this movie in the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie but that's definitely not the case. It is generally pleasant and ranks among the best entries of its kind. This is not a non-original remake of Dracula (like almost every other vampire movie in the world) or an action show without intelligence like Blade II. It just could have used a little more enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see a third installment of Carpenter, but that probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING the end was too predictable. Una should have gone away - that would have made the movie quite unusual.
