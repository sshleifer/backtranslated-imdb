This film, even if it addresses one of the favorite subjects of Mexican producers: the extreme life in our cities, has a fun way to put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the most important Mexican filmmakers of recent times, have stories of our city framed in various literary genres as it can be stuffing or satire, which gives us a movie with overexposed subject in our country, but told in a very different way that gives it a fresh tone. <br /> <br /> With little known actors, but who interpret their paper in an excellent way, each of the directors reflects in the stories the capacity by which we have been identified all over the world, this ability to laugh at pains and to celebrate sadness. The film may not have pleased many people in our country, but I believe that people in other countries might be attracted to Mexican surrealism.
