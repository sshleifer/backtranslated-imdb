I rented this movie as a DVD without knowing anything, part of a winter marathon of watching a movie every night. After several terrible American adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors seemed brilliantly original. The story is completely absurd, but I found the film's sincerity, friendliness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film is spectacular. Of course, the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by Hollywood, but filmmakers are wisely more interested in color, composition and movement than in realism and many shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman characters stand on steep rocky spiers, a huge moon rising in front of them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a warrior princess travels the skies behind her glowing sword like a missile in search of warmth. And colors explode from plane to plane, used to express emotions rather than to represent reality. <br /> <br /> The characters have the same simplicity and frankness as the comic characters, not offering a great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. Physically, many actors are incredibly beautiful. They play their roles directly, without irony or cunning, and are therefore credible. <br /> <br /> The strangest of all, despite the awkwardness of the plot and the meager characterizations, I found myself very close to tears in the end, moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the delusional vision and original of the director. <br /> <br />
