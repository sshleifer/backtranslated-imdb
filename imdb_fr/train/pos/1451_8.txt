I saw this film about 6 times now. And every time I look at it, I'm more impressed by the story and the acting. It's like watching a train wreck set in motion. His subtle approach, but very effective in achieving his goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> At the center of the story is a beautiful dichotomy. On the one hand, Eddy Calhoun (Cusack), deputy commander, unknowingly rips up the old boys' network that is the heart of the New York administration's major and, on the other hand, the mafia boss Zappati who deliberately attempts to maintain the status quo. by all necessary means. This situation culminates nicely in the end when Zappati orders Alselmo to calm himself down by killing himself and Calhoun, ordering Pappas to do the same, politically. <br /> <br /> as (one of my personal weaknesses): - You do not summarize the life of a man in an instant - The only new thing in this world is the story you do not know. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie that deserves a much higher rating.
