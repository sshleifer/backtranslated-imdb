The worst movie of all time? Wow, whoa now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it all depends on what you expect from a movie. I live in Oregon, so I enjoyed the beautiful film scenes of Smith Rocks, known yet both incredibly beautiful and other parts of central Oregon (and the sweet shades of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs who were watching Sissy's baby cradle at the beginning of the film). Those alone were enough to push me to give the film a better score than average. <br /> <br /> Or .... Maybe it all depends on what you expect. After reading the book AGES a few years ago and say to me: "Goodness divine, nobody could ever make a film of this interesting, weird and strange book ... especially 20 years later, when the morals (MORAYS - do not can not put brand focus online) have changed "- In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and I even liked to watch it again today. hui. <br /> <br /> Sissy was exceptionally cast, and I do not care what you all say, I was also pleasantly surprised by the performances of Rain Phoenix and John Hurt. I'm not lesbian, bi, nor trans, but I've met a lot of people who look like they were supposed to represent - and those "real" people have acted a little like those actors. Stilted a bit, stage-ey - always a little "on". Gus Van Sant is a strange native of Oregonian but by guys, he did a good job adapting this crazy book, IMHO.
