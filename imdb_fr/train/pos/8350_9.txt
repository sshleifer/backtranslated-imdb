As with this film, we follow the unlikely adventures so always captivating of the two main characters. But while C + J avoids sex for a girly journey in childhood, this couple revel in their charity even to the point of exploring homoeroticism. Most of the sex they acquire reluctant or reluctant partners and yet, despite their behavior deeply opposed to the computer, everyone comes out smiling. Like C + G, through all this, they remain innocent in the soul, rebels against the everyday, the bourgeois, the restrictive. As someone else has said, I would not want to know these 2 and it's a minor miracle that their trip brings mostly comedy scenes and very little tragedy (and what's that about can not be put on their doorstep) and so for that reason, it seduced me but with a sweet taste in the mouth. I dare that only the French can afford movies like this. And that's part of their genius.
