My sister and I rented this movie because we wanted something trashy and not so demanding to watch. However, the film has far exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It is more than the representation of a century. There are very real portraits of the characters and most of the actors do incredible work. The different stories are cooked together with real images of the time that give it a unique touch. Looking at it, I really felt that I was TEACHING about what had happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to congratulate Julia Stiles forever on her portrayal of Katie. She was great in a way that stands out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone ..
