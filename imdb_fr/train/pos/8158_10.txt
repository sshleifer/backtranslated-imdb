"The fear of a black hat" is all that the "CB-4" (much weaker) should have been. Rusty Cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless: he bends, shoots and mutilates all aspects of hip-hop trends and culture. Does "FoaBH" look like Spinal Tap? Yes a bit. Is it derived from Spinal Tap? Not really. The goal is more focused, the satire is better targeted and, to be honest, it's funnier.
