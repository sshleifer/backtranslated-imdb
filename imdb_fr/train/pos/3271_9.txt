I have always been a big fan of this movie, first of all you have seen the cast, the acting is superb and helps to advance this film very well. Cybill Shepherd received excellent reviews for her role and they were well deserved. The beginning of this film began in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage was turned upside down by the sudden death of her husband Louie. Fortunately, Louse has a second shot in life when he agrees to "retrain" on earth as newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to continue with his. But destiny crosses the path of Alex 23 years later, when he meets Corinne's daughter, Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson), and is suddenly invaded by a multitude of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins and that embarrassing situations occur.) The music is superb and the scenes are heart felt and very cute. You will not be disappointed if you give it a chance, chances are you will like it. Very funny and sweet!
