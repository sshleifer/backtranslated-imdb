In general, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies and at first, RUKA did not catch my attention. However, knowing that this film was shot under Czechoslovak repression under Soviet domination, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how innocent this little film was subversive. This subtext has truly given life to the film and has given it a truly enduring force, both a work of art and a political statement. <br /> <br /> This sad little movie is done without any dialogue, but it's pretty clear event. A cute little man made of wood makes a clay pot and has a good time when suddenly an animated hand that intrudes appears and destroys the pot - transforming it into a sculpture representing a hand. Well, the wooden man tries again and again to chase his hand and do his own thing. However, with time, the hand becomes more and more insistent and ends up putting the man in a cage. And, in the end, the man is dead thanks to the hand that interferes and the hand, as a sign of real hypocrisy, gives the man the funeral of a hero! <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his domineering government. Unsurprisingly, although the Czechs liked the film and praised it, the state (ie, the hand) banned this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka does not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the "velvet revolution".
