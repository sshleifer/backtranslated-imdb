The film is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it remains one of the greatest movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He does a great job in expressing the feelings of the book to the film. Few movies appeal to the feel of the book, unlike Mother Night.
