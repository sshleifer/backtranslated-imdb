This film is an excellent documentary. He follows the rap group, NWH, composed of "Ice Cold", "Tasty Taste" and "Tone Def", through their unique journey to the ups, downs and lows of gangster rap. With trouble with women, egos, cops, and whiteies, this group reaches the top of the gangster rap world, as the film rises to the top of documentaries. I know everyone's favorite document is This is Spinal Tap, for a very good reason, but I think if in a good mood, this movie is just better. The laughter never ends, even for people who are not part of the rap culture. <br /> <br /> I'm a white man, not interested in rap, his culture or anything else, but I love this movie. . Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the script, the songs and played there, showed great potential and it's a pity I have not seen it since Fear of a Black Hat. However, I've seen him once more, and that's why I recommend Fear of a Black Hat for quick laughs. <br /> <br /> Do not forget: "Do not shoot at you to see the whites! .... of their eyes? No, do not shoot to see the whites." <br /> < FYM and enjoy the movie.
