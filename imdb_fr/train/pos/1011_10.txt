I LOVE Jack jokes like "The cliché is ..." or "Above the cliché, black guy, oily skin, a little scary ...". He's just hilarious! Daniel begins to catch up! Fortunately Jack is no longer in the team (in a way) otherwise it would have been a sarcasm !!! I love all the intrigues (season 8, a little less, I must admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I start to understand the facial expressions (and more) of Jack, Daniel and Teal 'c ... All this is theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! Their I'm still going !!! Sorry, I'm also starting to take Carter's traits, and all of this drives my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for another three seasons, especially if they continue to pack the episodes with all that humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!! !!!! !
