A very good funny movie with Sweet Freeman (who plays himself) and who meets a Spanish named Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small store while looking for a potential independent film. I was a little suspicious about the movie for the first ten minutes, but as soon as he walked into the store, I really started enjoying the movie. This shows how a positive attitude can change everything. It does not contain complex plots and is easy to follow, but will raise the most sad moods and will make you smile throughout the course without the need for a romantic clich√©. It includes several scenes all along that make you laugh out loud. A very rare masterpiece!
