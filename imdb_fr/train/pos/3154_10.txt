This show is really hilarious! the jokes are original, god and I love Eric and Kelso! yes I know what they say, after the 8th season, it's more funny because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the series, and Randy is a real jerk. Randy is comparing to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> you can not take the funniest characters and swap them with the guy guy "I'm a cool guy" (Randy). it's not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it still is, not as much as the previous seasons, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> The 360s are awesome, the circles, Red is a real kind of father abusing the thought :) and kitty is always half-pie mid-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he also has his moments. the least favored characters are Jackie and Donna. they are cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> great show. Idiot!
