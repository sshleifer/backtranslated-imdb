Even though I was in this film playing the role of sheriff Hodges, he still managed to blow me up in many places and believe that I'm not so easy. You could say that I am biased about the film and, okay, I am, but I did not see the finished product until 27/12/2006 and I was extremely happy. I'm not a horror movie fan as such, but I love Sci Fi's old "B" movies and black and white movies. This movie will make you "think" you know when something is going to happen, so it's not, so it is. This will keep you completely unbalanced. I would suggest watching the movie first, followed by the director's notes and special features. It is so well written, directed and filmed and I can tell you personally that it was a real pleasure to work with this team and this cast. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
