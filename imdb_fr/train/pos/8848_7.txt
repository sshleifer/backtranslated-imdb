I watched this movie in a very strange way - I put it on my Netflix list and I could not remember why (other than that, I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman was there). As the film has no opening credits, I did not even remember its director. <br /> <br /> While my wife and I were watching, I turned to her about 45 minutes before saying, "You know, I still want to decide that I hate this movie, but something to his subject will not let me just stop watching him. "Then there are half a dozen scenes in the middle of the film that are really electrifying in the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It was only when the end credits were recorded that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet. movie. And I thought - wow. I'm amazed that Lumet touched on what was really a dirty, mean story about really bad and broken people. But it is the proof of his talent that I was so seduced that I did not even know it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good in this film. Like scary good. Put this in front of Capote and I would say that the Oscar should have been for this film instead. <br /> <br /> I also highly recommend the special narrative section with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talking about the film's making - it's entertaining. and educational, with Hawke playing the student eager to learn at the feet of the master. Lumet certainly teaches you the first rule of working with actors - kiss their asses constantly !! <br /> <br /> There are many violent and melodramatic movies that are empty figures when all is said and done. And there is one element of that in this film - that the actors fill the air with sulphurous emotions, and that when the smoke dissipates, there is nothing left. Nothing sounds more deeply. <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us Network and Twelve Angry Men - movies that, in their own way, have been elevated to the highest level of cinema. <br /> <br /> This film is not at this level. But there is something that lasts. And maybe that's enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment is about the comments - if you look at the number of comments on this little movie about IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con - it's a good indication that something special happens in this movie.
