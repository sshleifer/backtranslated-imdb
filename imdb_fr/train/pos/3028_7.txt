It could have been a better movie. It trails, and the central story goes from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging the death of Wanda Hendrix, but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil. His stories are all stories of morality, because of his own considerations of Catholicism, guilt and innocence (terms very relative in his vision of the world) and the human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist, who has sided with Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He was sent to England to try to reach a desperately needed arms purchase agreement. Unfortunately for Denard, he is literally alone: ​​each of his contacts turns out to be a voluntary overthrow for the Falagists of Spain. In particular Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez), a dark guardian of pension, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras), teacher of an international language of the "Esperanto" type. Wanda Hendrix is ​​the chore of a girl (Else) who works for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a frequent associate of the Falangists. <br /> <br /> The British (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander and the best, if not the worst, George Coulouris) do not give much hope to Boyer's cause (which he soon understands for Britain ). Herbert and Mander retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the governments of Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin during the Civil War. Coulouris is a typical type of Colonel Blimp - always flawless in his English diction, he is keen in showing his aversion to strangers in general. <br /> <br /> The only ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), trying here to play her part as well as she can - but she can not really. She is an aristocrat - the daughter of a lord of the press. It was Bacall's second film and (unfortunately, his long career almost sank). She plays well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the double effect of playing with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is a good actor, but he is not Bogie and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks. Her next film brought her back to Bogie and Hawks, and her star resumed her ascent. <br /> <br /> It's a dark film (as was the case for the novel). Boyer's mission never succeeds, because he has too many enemies hidden everywhere. But the bad guys are also losers - frequently with their lives. <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour as a suspect foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her). We also need to watch the many Warner players who do their best given the weakness of their management.
