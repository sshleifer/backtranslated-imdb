Although I like On the Town better, I really liked that. I am a newcomer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I heard about them, I had never seen anything with them until recently. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me a fan of Gene. I think it's better too. But I thought this movie was good and that, like all movies, some parts are better than others but in my book, it's a great movie and I love it. Frank and Gene are a good team. I have not seen them together yet in Take me to the baseball game. But I remain faithful to my arguments, because I am delighted and I loved it!
