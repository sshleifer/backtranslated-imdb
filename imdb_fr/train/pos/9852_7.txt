There is not a day without the release of a new computer animation movie. So we really have more chances to see more than beautiful effects. After watching Ice Age, I felt it did not have as much impact on me as other movies like that. <br /> <br /> But that's because I'm a big guy now, and I'm pretty sure it's a very nice movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple and the "actors" are fun in a cute way, without raw or complex humor. Even the "diabolical" is a big fat fluffy cat with these fun teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a little disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way), but a very good thing for the kids. And apart from some fighting, no one dies (not even when he is trampled by a mammoth, several times), which gave a feeling of cartoonism. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, except for some really nice cartoony scenes, where you want to walk in a pretty picture or in the pages of a comic book. [That still means a lot of work!] <br /> <br /> There were gags that made me smile - I accept, the creators have tried to satisfy these adults - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) best left unnoticed because you do not feel comfortable in the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie, but it's more like Disney, ideal for a world and fluffy animals for kids. If you do not hate cute animals that do fun things, look at it at least once.
