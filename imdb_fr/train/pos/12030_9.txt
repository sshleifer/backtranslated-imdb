hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love Twisted Desire, and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart on TV because I think she's fine. I'm also a real fan of teenage witch Sabrina, so it helped me watch the movie (I do not ask). I love the way Nicole plans to kill her parents very carefully, because she makes sure someone else pulls the trigger and exerts herself on the bottles, so she does not give not his fingerprints (a very well planned idea), everything returned nicole when she got caught while her old boyfriend arrives and puts a camera hidden under his shirt. I give this film a nine out of ten and I put it in my list of the top 10 films. Finally, if someone sees this film in stores, tell me, because I saw it on television and I did not record it. goodbye
