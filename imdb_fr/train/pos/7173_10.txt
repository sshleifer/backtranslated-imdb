I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV network. This is without a doubt one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences! It tells about the artists and the creative talent of the San Francisco Bay Area, responsible for some of the best movies ever made. In addition to the known artists mentioned, it also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment on Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD. It is an indispensable document for any collection on the history of cinema and the production of brilliant films. If you are interested in distance films and their creators, you will not be disappointed.
