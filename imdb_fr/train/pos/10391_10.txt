It is very rare for a film to please viewers of all ages - children for a beautiful story and a beautiful and colorful production, and adults for a literate scenario, excellent production values, a good cast / theater, all linked with a good Rozsa score. Two more or less contemporary films do so: "The Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Part of the story of this production is fascinating. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, was transferred to Hollywood and served as a cover for British intelligence efforts! The producer, Alexander Korda, was knighted in 1942. Here is a unique case of the intersection of art, commerce and politics! Of course, get a good CD of this movie for your library!
