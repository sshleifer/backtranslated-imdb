I admit to being a bit jaded of the cinematographic genre of a young child that softens the heart of his reluctant tutor. I have seen enough ?? Baby Boom, Kolya, about a boy, mostly Martha and, to some extent, Whale Rider ?? expect to be bored by the formula. What caught my attention in The King of Masks is the sadness of the scenery: the small Chinese city of the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm, and the girls were considered so vain for the poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whoever wanted to take them to the black market. When Wang discovers that her grandchild bought, nicknamed "Doggie", is a granddaughter, he rejects her initially, even though she has shown great promise as a street heir. Even after having reluctantly brought her back, he is not too upset when she is kidnapped. The film is then realistic and shows how much a smart street girl had to survive in this society. <br /> <br /> The two main representations are credible and attractive in their societal context. In a Western society, one would at least expect a hint of resentment from Wang for not having achieved more material success. Wang accepts his station so well as a famous artist with a low social status, although I too. While Doggie displays a level of precocity and cunning that might be suspect in a modern suburban child, it is quite believable in the context of a child constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls as garbage . And after learning that her seven previous owners had physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang made perfect sense. <br /> <br /> A look at the life of a small city in a foreign country, the naturalness of both The actors, the surprising twists and, of course, the comforting resolution all contribute to a very film watchable.
