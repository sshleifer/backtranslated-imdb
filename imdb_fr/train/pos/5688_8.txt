Opening credits: awesome. Music: just what you need for this movie. Cinematography: ladle with strong effect. <br /> <br /> A disconcerting enthusiasm of the kind. This is how certain lives can become uncontrollable. "Wonderland" describes the drug-induced wildness (and its consequences) not as an aberration, but shows how this really happens in our society. It's better than the representations of another wild group - Manson - because all the movies, books, etc. Manson's focus is so much on Manson's foolish spirit as on the overall image of cheap celebrity and randomness that is so ubiquitous nowadays. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "actors of the method", watch Kilmer in this movie. It shows how "The Method" can compete in the right role. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers succeed here in elevating "absolute control" to the level of an artistic form, and not only to give us cheap shivers.
