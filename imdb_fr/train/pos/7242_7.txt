1933 seemed to be an excellent year for satires ("Duck Soup" for example) and it fits well, even if it is the obsession of contractual bridge. The tone resembles a humorous piece of The New Yorker, appropriate, since the film begins with the page "Goings On About Town" of this magazine. The only strange thing is the casting. Made a few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. However, after 1934, adultery would not have been treated so sophisticated, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in legendary outfits, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge show on the radio. Even if you do not know anything about bridge, you might want to take a look at a rare example of Hollywood satire.
