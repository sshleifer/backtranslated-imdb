This zombie and fun short film of 1916 - at the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy - portrays young Oliver Hardy as a clever man who must quickly impress his rich uncle by producing his baby wife for his visit. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not going well and soon, there are more wives and babies than he can bear; plus the mandatory prosecutions and misunderstandings that characterize the slapstick of the first films. <br /> <br /> Well restored, it can be seen as part of "Oliver Hardy's First Movies" and is now available on DVD, an interesting addition to the corpus available from the duo of favorite comedies on the big screen.
