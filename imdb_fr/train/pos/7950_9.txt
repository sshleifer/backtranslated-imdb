First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's musical score, very lyrical, which only added to the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film was the three animals, superbly cast by Michael J.Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather engaging character (the voice of reason), and Field adds wit to a character who is still seen advertising Chance. Humans were not so endearing, and sometimes the film dragged on, but that's my only complaint. It's a beautiful film, with beautiful close-ups of Canada, I believe. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a really boring moment, and the work of the voice and a well-written script put it forward. In short, a charming film and perhaps underestimated, with a 9/10 of me. Bethany Cox.
