These were called "educational" caricatures because it was a mix of serious messages and a fun main character called "Snafu Pvt." <br /> <br /> We all have an imagination, fears and others do you have, and that's what happens here as a Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and offers "five". You can trigger panic and all kinds of disasters if you have enough rumors and enough people believe them. This includes the loss of confidence in your country and your cause, as shown here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. This is still happening today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war", says a big nut near the end of this caricature. It's amazing how some Americans still have not learned. This caricature may be 65 years old, but it still has relevance today At the time of writing, there have been two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some still believe that war on terror "is just a slogan for stickers. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess", uses analogies here with the "balloon juice" to present the message above.

It was a period of tension
