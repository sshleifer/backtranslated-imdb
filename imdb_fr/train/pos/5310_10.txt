Pecker is another mainstream film by John Waters made on a smaller format than Serial Mom. The main character of Pecker's hobby is to photograph everything he sees. It does not matter if it is dirty or shocking when taking pictures. He soon uses the images he has taken and displays them in his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle class family. His father works in a bar with a claw machine, but does not make enough money with a lesbian stripper on the other side of the street. His mother runs a savings store and loves to dress the poor. Her older sister, Tina, works in a gay bar where her specialty is commerce. His youngest, Little Chrissy, is used to eating sugar, sugar and nothing but sweet foods. Her grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays a ventriloquist with her. He also has 2 friends. Among his friends, Matt is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a carpet of laundry as if she were a dictator. Soon, a New York tourist buys his images and exposes them in an art gallery. With the image comes glory, but the pictures expose the unusual lifestyle of the simple life of his friends and family. For a R-rated film, Pecker is certainly more docile than most of the previous Waters R-rated movies and even flamingos. 10 out of 10!
