This frightening and rather bloody adaptation of Stephen King's great novel features remarkable central performances by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who died sadly a few years ago) and Denise Crosby, as well as truly macabre gore effects. a wonderful sense of visual style, and manages to make it one of the rare versions of King's work that is not only worth the detour, but makes it really annoying.The description of the zombie child Gage (Miko Hughes- later in "New Nightmare") is also notable, have been a ludicrous character is made threatening and spooky.As for people, who think that this one is not scary-look at him alone in the dark (finally with your delusional girlfriend) and I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" will crawl Some horror movies like this or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" should not be viewed in a group. Recommended for horror fans!
