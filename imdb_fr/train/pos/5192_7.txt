I am a kung fu fan, but not a fan of Woo. I'm not interested in gangster movies full of gun games. Now the martial arts; *it's beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a very entertaining film about kung-fu, which has almost * too much fights, if such a thing is possible! It's good. <br /> <br /> Many fight scenes are very good (and some are worse), and the main characters are fun and friendly. The bad guys are a little too incredibly nasty, but entertaining all the same. You must see the sleep assistant! He can only fight when he is asleep - it's hysterical! <br /> <br /> After repeated viewing, Last Hurray For Chivalry may tend to be a little boring and breathless, especially because a lot of fight scenes are actually not so good. As a result, I rate it "only" a 7 out of 10. But it's really almost an "8". <br /> <br /> In summary, one of the best kung fu movies, created in the heart of kung-fu cinema as a bonus. All the very good kung fu movies date from the mid-to-late 1970s, with a few exceptions from the late '60s and early' 70s (and early '80s, to be honest).
