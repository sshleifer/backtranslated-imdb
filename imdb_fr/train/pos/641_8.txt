This show contains a few snapshots and some of Dawson's most memorable moments (a 16-year-old man talking about when life made sense?), But overall, it seems like a decent show . Most of the characters seem very real and the story seems to be moving forward in the pilot project - ending with a good lesson at the end. I just hope that every episode will not change life like the first, it would be too dramatic for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a passionate baseball teenager. I think many of us could understand his wondrous vision and sometimes the tunnel vision of the team he always wanted to be part of.
