Let me make one thing clear: Essentially, the mindset of those who run the show in Hollywood frankly deceives me right from the start, and even more so with regard to the treatment of the iconic characters on the tape pages. comic. Why? Let's take a typical Hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate our point. <br /> <br /> Executive # 1 "Hey, there are a lot of dollars to glean from superhero movies these days." <br /> <br /> N ° 2 Executive 'Good point, let's do it with haste! ?? We'll do a lucky dive in a hat and randomly choose a superhero on which to base a movie! (The dive takes place and a famous superhero name is out) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Great! Now, who can we play this role? <br /> <br /> N ° 2: "Who is a box office star yet?" <br /> <br /> Executive # 1 'The * name of the great actor * is the star of this week.' <br /> <br /> N ° 2 Executive 'But is it really good for the role? I mean, he does not look like the character at all. <br /> <br /> # 1 in the executive 'Who Cares ?! It's a big name We'll do the movie with him anyway. <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'You're absolutely right! And besides, we will fill the film as a whole to relieve the stupid masses that no one will ever doubt! "<br /> <br /> The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons I hate most modern superhero movies.All the style, no substance and just pathetic casting Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the rule above, when Hollywood succeeds-take the cast of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman, Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in X-Men movies. <br /> <br /> But back to the negative traits generally displayed by Hollywood today? .. would not it be wonderful if our studio executives ALWAYS to choose actors who really suited the roles Well, in this less than ideal world, a filmmaker just believes it, by staging actors based on their real resemblance to their counterparts in comics. call Sandy Collora. (but generally), Hollywood has not yet allowed Collora to make a feature film, but fortunately for us, it gave us a tempting glimpse of what the final result would look like in two (for the moment ) famous. super short films. One is the superb Batman: Dead End and the other is this mock-up of a fictional movie called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, do not mumble our words here ?? it's absolutely great! <br /> <br /> The cast of Michael O'Hearn, the winner of Mr. Universe and male model (who looked just as awesome but was completely lost in the barbaric drab) is the most Perfect to play the iconic man of steel. In fact, in terms of physical resemblance, there has never been an approximation closer to the comic character. <br /> <br /> Added to that, Clark Bartram is back from his splendid performance as a Black Knight in Batman: Dead Fin; Once again, another extremely wise casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If only it was really a real movie! Hollywood studio executives ?? take note! That's the way it should be done! <br /> <br /> Finally, I am again intrigued by the very shared reactions that this short film has aroused in fans. Significantly, the harshest and most vivid reactions against him are once again manifest (in the same way as Batman: Dead End) by a younger and less experienced audience in terms of cinema; a fact betrayed by their somewhat primitive and grammatically grammatical diatribes. Such an unfortunate state of closed-mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon, but the aforementioned Hollywood studio executives will undoubtedly enjoy great satisfaction. After all, those same lost people are probably the same kind of popcorn fools who are crazy about most bullshit and who love most of the bullshit Hollywood produces today.
