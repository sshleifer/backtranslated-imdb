I.Q. is, in my opinion, a sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a boring guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited to Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. Anyway, everyone involved in this film did an absolutely exceptional job. In conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person to any Tim Robbins fan or Meg Ryan who has not seen it. You'll be laughing, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch it.
