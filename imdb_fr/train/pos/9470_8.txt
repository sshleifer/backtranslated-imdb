I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this movie about Dan, a columnist of advice, who goes to his parents for a stay with his children and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. It's a story that has been told before, but not like that. There are just too many little things that make the movie better than it should be. The casting is beautiful, and although Carell is not my cup of tea, he's good enough as a widower who is supposed to know everything but finds that knowing is different from feeling and sometimes life surprises you. Sometimes as clever and wise as a Hallmark card can be annoying, the film still manages to grow and become something more than an ordinary movie. Worth seeing
