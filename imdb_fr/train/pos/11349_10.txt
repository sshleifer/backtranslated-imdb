This movie may have a dubious pedigree because it was designed for television, but it's one of the best movies I've seen. The film and its actors have won several awards. It is captivating, fascinating and will absorb you completely. The story of a murder hunt in the Iron Curtain in Russia by people willing to risk their careers in an attempt to save the lives of future victims would be a fascinating story if it were a fiction - but it's a true story. I highly recommend it.
