"The Ladies Man" suffers from a common problem among the films based on the skits of "Saturday Night Live". And that is to say that a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not succeed as well in ninety minutes. Even if this film has its laughs, like Tim Meadows like Leon Phelps, a sex maniac straight out of the 70s, and Will Ferrell as a husband obsessed with wrestling and cuckolded by Leon. So this movie is pretty funny, but it's not "Wayne's World"!
