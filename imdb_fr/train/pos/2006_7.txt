At this point, it seems almost pointless to say that Jon Bon Jovi delivers a firm, solid and homogeneous performance in the manner of Derek Bliss. His acting abilities have been established by his critical success in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). But, in case someone still wonders, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can do well and that's what is expected of him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who tells about success on VH-1. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not watch a horror movie. I have come to expect them to focus on sensational sensation rather than dialogue and intrigue. What I liked the most in this film was that there was really a viable plot. The gore is not at the point of becoming the center of the film and does not present a disturbing realism quality with higher technical effect budgets. So, gore fans may be disappointed, but history fans will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like U-571 where dialogue takes second place, we have the chance to know "the good guys" and really care about what happens to them. Some scenes are unexplained (like Derek's hallucinations), but you have the impression that certain aspects are such that they had to lay the foundations for a sequel. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood for this movie, this sequel will never happen. These few cases are forgivable, knowing that the Vampires could have been a continuous series. <br /> <br /> Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? Is it a good way to spend about two hours entertaining? Yes. The person who fears horror movies with insomnia will not leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either. If you are somewhere between the horror genre and the horror lover, this movie is for you. It reaches a happy medium with effects and story in balance. <br /> <br />
