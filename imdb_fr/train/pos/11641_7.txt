I just watched an episode about Brad, the drug and drug addict who turned to an addicting life on the streets after his racing career, was upset as quickly as he started. I must say that the story of his cycling career was more heartbreaking than his addiction. Here is the young man who wins bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks. Upon his arrival, he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes of all time, and is generally insensitive and hostile. to everyone in general. Naturally, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the series talks about his fight against drug addiction and how he found his life, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him to make his act like such a donkey? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was confused as to how the series was prepared, because it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see pictures of him handling the pan and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack. I did not even know it was legal to show it, but why would a film crew follow him and film him? Do they do it in the hope that this guy will change his life and give him some material for a good TV episode? <br /> <br /> In any case, it is a rewarding show because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control they can take on people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how much families and friends suffer from the drug addict's indifference, although I have to admit that in the end, it all seems a little too clear. There are moments in the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and I should perhaps warn the spoilers here, everything has a little too much feeling of happiness at the end , and I feel that this is a very rare event in real life. But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that?
