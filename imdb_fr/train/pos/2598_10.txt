As if the film had no value in itself, it's a great way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to its reading. In the summer of 1968, I saw the movie in New York. this fall, I read the book for the first time. Part of the pleasure of reading the novel was my memory of the film scrupulously detailed. And for better or for worse - and I've been reading and teaching the novel for more than 30 years - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
