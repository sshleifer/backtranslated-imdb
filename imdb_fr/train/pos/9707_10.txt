About a year ago, I finally gave up American television. I was thinking of giving up television completely until a friend who lived in England showed me programs like The Office, Extras, Blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. That's when I decided to switch to British television. Of all the shows listed above, The League of Gentlemen is without a doubt the darkest and most twisted of all, offering guilty laughs and content that can not be found in any other comedy I've seen . The characters included are the most unhappy married couple, a butcher who puts ingredients in the meat that are not told (probably for the better), a deranged couple who looks over a local store that only serves the local population , and the worst veterinarian ever. This program is one of the best I've seen.
