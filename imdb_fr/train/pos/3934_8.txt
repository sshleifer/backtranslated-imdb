Young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic and beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most venerated figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of representing a mythical character while making it human enough for people to care about it. This is perhaps the best performance of the actors. Watch how he alone stops a lynching-mob. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer. Most of the last elements of the film take place in a room I can say something negative about this film. Most of the characters, from the judge to the viewer, receive so many folk lines and humor that divert the attention of the serious trial currently taking place. . The support pieces of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
