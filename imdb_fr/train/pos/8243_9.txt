In another decade of the 1950s, when an epidemic of undead (caused by a mysterious "space dust") was mastered through the use of special electronic collars, a lonely young man, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido ( Billy Connelly), his domesticated zombie recently acquired by the family. <br /> <br /> Fido quickly becomes a substitute father for Timmy, whose real father is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or his hot wife, played by Carrie-Anne Moss) having suffered a psychological scarring in his childhood (when he was forced to shoot at his own father, who tried to eat it!). <br /> <br /> Timmy, however, comes up against a point of boredom. when his putrid friend's collar flashes, he attacks and kills an elderly neighbor. With the authorities following in Fido's footsteps, trouble with a pair of local bullies, and his mother connecting with their home help, will the undead be able to keep his newfound friend? <br /> <br /> Fido is a deliciously dark comedy that should please anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor. Grasping Romero's zombies and transplanting it to a small 1950s American town is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole theme of Reanimated dead "that I saw. <br /> <Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Hall of Fame of the movie Undead, alongside Bub of Day Of The Dead and Tarman of Return Of The Living Dead; it's not often that I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the performance of The Big Yin is so beautiful that I found myself looking for the big bag of blue pus! The rest of the cast also gives commendable performances, with the young K'Sun Ray (Timmy) and Ms. Moss, who deserve special mention - Ray, because for the one who is so young, he plays a particularly strong role, and Moss This is the third zombie movie I've seen this week (the others being Planet Terror, a bit disappointing, and Flight of The Living Dead, pretty fun), and to my surprise, it's also the best . Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to cherish and is a talent to look into the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
