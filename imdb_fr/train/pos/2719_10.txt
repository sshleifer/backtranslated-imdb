I saw this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It's amazing how the homosexual relations between the author and the protagonists are sublimated in the film. The journalist is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly, but seeing it a second time, we get all kinds of interesting information from comparisons that author / director Brooks creates. <br /> <br /> Note the incredible cut at the beginning where killers and those who are going to be killed are bound. The cutter on the phone is paired to Perry on the phone. The cutter washing his face is cut in the manner of Perry. Only Perry looks in the mirror and his erotic body, which gives him the impression of playing guitar in Las Vegas on empty chairs. This failure / fantasy is the fantasy of failure that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska, but finds it perpetually empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting pheasants and pheasants I do not know they're going to die. we cut to Clutter. <br /> <br /> Perry tells of his dream of a yellow bird, "Taller than Jesus", who attacks the nuns who persecuted them. "The nuns asked for mercy," he says, "but the bird has slaughtered them anyway." The bird raised Perry to heaven. Strangely, Perry says he has an aversion to nuns, God and religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know who. <br /> <br /> The director puts all sorts of tips and tricks. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter is offered sleeping with friends. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later. Nancy can not sleep at her friend's house because her boyfriend comes to dinner. The decision seals his fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre". But that's another Bogart picture, "Beat the Devil," co-written by Truman Capote, where the McGuffin is a fictional treasure hunt. But Dick knows that the protagonists of this movie did not give anything. Dick wants hard money, the $ 10,000 he thinks is in Clutter's vault (which paradoxically turns out to be as fantastic as Perry's Mexican treasure). <br /> <br /> Cut to Herb Clutter Signing $ 40,000 Life Insurance He's thinking about mortality for now, ironically, his death is about to end in a few hours, and the insurance agent on behalf of the company wants him life, once again ironic when you know what will happen in a few hours. <Dick said they did not want witnesses to be remembered, but later, it's because they eliminated all the witnesses they remembered. <br /> <br /> "There was a witness," the detective will continue to tell Dick later, but was this witness the prison's friend? , Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or God The spectator becomes the witness after watching the film. <br /> <br /> Fascinating film.
