It was an excellent movie with good distribution, all hitting at full speed. And when Dianne Keaton is at her best, well, it's just not better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, still underestimated, was even better. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint concerns one aspect of the scenario. None of the characters ever recognized that the dead girl was not always a good person. And his mother either, played by Keaton. At one point, she breaks a promise to a character not to reveal that he was sleeping around. <br /> <br /> One of the commentators said the film had a "political agenda". It's a disconcerting thing to say. There was no politics at all in this movie.
