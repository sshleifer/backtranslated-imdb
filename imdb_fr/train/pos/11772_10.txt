In another crazy Bugs Bunny shorts, the famous Leporid * works in a showcase of department stores, when the owner, Gildersleeve, decides to cram it. Of course, this is almost impossible, because Bugs apparently knows better the store than Gildersleeve (and knows when to disguise). As always, they keep everything going at top speed. So you have to wonder how this comic should look hilarious in its infancy! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a beautiful example of the Looney Tunes' appearance in the 1940s before the Termite Terrace crowd perfected them. But do not get me wrong, the drawings were still really good after the arrival of refined shapes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a great idea. <br /> <br /> * Leporides are rabbits and hares.
