I saw this movie for the first time coming back from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. I think the film itself is quite a masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that people should do. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors in the world. In this French film, he embodies a divorced father and businessman who have lost all enthusiasm for life until he passes through a man with Down syndrome who lives in an institution with other patients with Alzheimer's disease. Down syndrome. The actors, including the actor who actually has Down syndrome, create a friendship and a credible relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and ours are forever changing with the man with Down syndrome. He realizes that life is not just work and play, but living and loving, and that's what life should be. The end is a bit silly, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. Just bring a tear to your eye.
