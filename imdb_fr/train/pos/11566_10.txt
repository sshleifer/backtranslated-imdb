A FROLICS OF YOUTH Short subject. <br /> <br /> A teenager, embarrassed by his fear of dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned spaniel he finds helps him to change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a nice little film in which Shirley Temple steals all her scenes as the animated child sister of the hero. The opening gag - dealing with bedwetting - is in bad taste, but it is quickly forgotten. The highlights: the climactic punches, which have an impressive realism. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected today, short one or two short subjects have been useful to the Studios as important training grounds for front and back camera. The dynamic of creating a successful short film was completely different from that of a feature film, which amounts to writing high quality news rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and schedule and able to represent a wide range of materials, the short subjects are the perfect complement to the feature films of the Studios.
