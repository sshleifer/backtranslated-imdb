A promising young graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for the murder of an innocent girl and sentenced to death. Sean Connery plays the role of the "happy and lucky" lawyer that the young man's grandmother seeks to find after his retirement and asks him to defend him in the hope of releasing his grandson. Laurence Fishburne is a police officer who has been involved in the case and is determined to refute a theory that Connery may be searching to try to free the boy that he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the late Lynne Thigpen are co-stars of this very intense drama thriller.
