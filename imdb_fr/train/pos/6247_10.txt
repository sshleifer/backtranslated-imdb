The trailers in this film may show scenes of violence or unconventional sexuality, but these scenes are only rare fragments, chosen to attract the public. They broadcast of course the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> People who get hit on the head in their work and their lives, using the power they may have elsewhere, to oppress notoriously others. And at the bottom of the chain of oppression, mostly women. <br /> <br /> A film showing this as brutally as Hundstage is surely hard to cope with, but having to endure such lives is even harder. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film looks a lot like Short Cuts, but consists of documentary style episodes, featuring people like your neighbor, who play exactly as they are. Without any flicker, and most disturbing, without any hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing, because you realize that such people are present and there are many, although our society focuses on the beautiful external aspects. Somewhere where the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence must occur, somewhere hope must collapse. I know some of these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie without funny scenes (some may think that the disabled woman who repeats the top 10 supermarkets is funny, but it actually happens) and without any melodramatic, will watch this movie . However, I'm afraid this will happen if you focus on subtitles because subtitles can not convey the emphasis.
