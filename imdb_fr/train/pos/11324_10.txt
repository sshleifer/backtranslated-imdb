I agree with everyone who posted. <br /> <br /> I watched it a long time ago but I'll tell you, every time I hear some music of this anime, it reminds me of the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling that I felt watching him, and it makes me cry (a feeling so happy but sad). However, I found that the love story was somewhat rushed and that they did not explain things correctly, but that did not spoil the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I loved this anime so much that after the end, I just had to do some research (and look at the end a few more times) and found all my answers and so much more. I like the way they set up historical legends to fit in this anime, it was amazing and it made me want to deepen my research (I have always been interested in some historical characters associated with this anime). <br /> <I think it should have been a longer series, but if that's all they had to do, they were successful. I would recommend it to anyone who loves emotional cartoons with an excellent story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and some fantastic action. <br /> <br /> Moreover, even if it was based on a game H it does not contain any element of this type and I really prefer it this way (I have no problem with mature cartoons, in in most cases, I prefer it).
