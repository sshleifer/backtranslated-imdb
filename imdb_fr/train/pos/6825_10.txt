I was absolutely blown away by the opening night of John Cassavetes. This is the first film I've seen that I know that seems to be on a larger scale, so it feels more public, but it still does not seem to have become more rooted than in its previous films. That may be what makes it so intense. There is also something cathartic about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> That's what makes Cassavetes make his career a mainstay of his career, an ideal he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director. here to express it before. The character of Rowlands, the actress of middle-aged theater Myrtle Gordon, can not bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production. It does not follow calculation, pulse after pulse, which causes chaos on stage until it finds the right one. This is a boldly abstract premise. <br /> <br /> It's a film that does not fail to capture the innate direction that one goes through during an emotional cleansing. Nobody understands why Myrtle does a lot of things she does, and this is seen and even portrayed as something destructive, yet it may be the best thing for her. It can be a cleaning rather than a breakdown. A withdrawal, a cocoon, a rebellion, all this leads to a collapse. Cassavetes gives his character a brutally real touch. That is to say, at the time, she fervently asserts that she has nothing in common with her character. Yet she fears that the opposite will not happen. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the climactic performance that Myrtle shares with a character painfully separated from her who plays with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, percussive, enlightening and enjoyable moments that I I've never seen in a movie
