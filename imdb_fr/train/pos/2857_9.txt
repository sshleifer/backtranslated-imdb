In our vocabulary of the late 1950s, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, and so on. on this superb show "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> It was Saturday night and everyone was stuck on the TV. It was a real show illustrating family values. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that brought everyone together. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was the patriarch of the family. His words described wisdom. We are often astonished to ask that Ben Cartwright, a widower, must have been the best husband of his poor wife who died. He raised wonderful sons. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all wondered why Pernell Roberts had left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts made a lot of money for his departure. His career never took off since he was associated as Cartwright's son. He should have tried to return to the series. He certainly lost a windfall by retiring.
