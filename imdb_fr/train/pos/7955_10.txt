It's one of the best children's and pets movies ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow shouting "Wait, wait for me Peter!" as the family car moves away. It's a must if you like animals! Best movie of all time! The lines of the movie are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; "The rule of cat and dogs drool!" Lines like that, I could do without it, but when I was six, I bet I loved that line. The story may seem catchy to some, but I like it. Shadow, the older dog that prepares Chance to replace him after his departure, is really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a part of themselves in "Homeward Bound".
