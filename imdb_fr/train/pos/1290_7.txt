Yes, I remember this one! Many years since I watched it. The story was totally surreal, but still great! What anyone who evaluates and comments on movies should keep in mind is the purpose of the movie in question. It's the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Some movies - like this one here - are for simple, comical nonsense. Such films can not be evaluated from the point of view of a hypercritical critic. Of course, these films lack quality, sophisticated intrigue, very often lack of first-class actors, but if they fulfill their main objective, that's fine. I do not have this film here in my list of favorites of all time, but I always thought it was funny, that I had very pleasant sequences and that I made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway.
