I am so sorry that ABC gives up another show that is lucky to be a real winner. This show is so good that the writing and screenplay were excellent, an original idea for a show rather than another boring reality show. The cast was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors in the foreground, but they formed a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea are really a new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us sharing this idea of ​​"connections". I really like the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is not a single person connected to this show that I did not like, even those who had only a few episodes (Sheri Appleby for example). The acting and characters are so easy to love and so talented !! I would have liked ABC to have given this show more luck and not stopped it midway. Moreover, this has not been sufficiently announced. Really unfair !! to everybody!!. This show was very promising. For my part, I will let ABC know how I feel and I will continue to send emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13 - I want this last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!!
