I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic drawing "Casper the Friendly Ghost". I thought it was a start because Casper did not look * ok *, in the same way that Porky Pig did not look * ok * in the old 1930s cartoons. But I move away from the subject ... Anyway, this episode of life after the death of the friendly ghost is about him befriending a young fox he calls Ferdie. I remember being happy to see Casper having a friend, as those who watched the cartoons do not know that most people are running away shouting "A ghost!" <br /> Casper and Ferdie have fun together until someone else shows up ... I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon lasts only seven minutes, you can not so not be too ambiguous. In addition, anyone who reads the IMDb synopsis of the cartoon can deduce what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> The final is a bit heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the saddest thing I've ever felt watching a cartoon. But that only means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not many others. Or, the fact that I remember this drawing is due to its emotional effect on me - I have not seen it since. But the drawing ends on an optimistic note, and I was happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this cartoon 8 stars out of 10. Second after the Warner Bros cartoon. "Peace on Earth" is the most that I have ever been touched by an animated short film.
