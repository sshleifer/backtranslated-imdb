Excellent. Realistic and faithful portrayal of pioneer life on ranches in the western plains, with emphasis on the role and place of women. A moving film, made with love and based on real people and their real experiences. Independent film at low budget; never made money. This is not the romantic and unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneering life.
