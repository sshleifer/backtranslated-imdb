This is an EXCELLENT example of Bette Davis' first talent. The production is above average for the period 1936. I do not understand why the owners of the rights on this film did not put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE PLEASE FREE IT. I would buy it immediately. I have not seen it for over thirty years on television, but remember it well.
