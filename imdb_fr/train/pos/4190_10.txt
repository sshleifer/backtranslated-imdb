Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just watched again. I could not help but become emotional in his last scene. She did not have the Oscar. That's why you should not trust the Oscars too much. Richard Widmark has never had a better role and has been a perfect cast as a flawed human being in 3D. Jean Peters was great as a streetwise, hard girl in his best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; otherwise why should I hate it? Yes, patriotism was heavy. but without that, you do not have a lot of film. Look at their faces! The top three stars do not really need a lot of scripting. I would have liked to see them do this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", you may know what I mean. When I was a child in 1956 on my first trip to New York, I forced my uncle from the Bronx to drive us to the foot of South Street in search of number 66. That's when I realized that we could not trust Hollywood. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I do not tell a lot about this story, because I hate it when I know what's going on before I see it myself. If you have seen it, no explanation is necessary. Maybe someone reading these comments did not see "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; but do not look for 66 South Street in New York.
