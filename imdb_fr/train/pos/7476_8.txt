I can truly say that I felt the film in its very essence, where the games of the spirit of dreamlike reality enter into the surrealistic aspect of Tom Cruise's future. I did not care much about Tom Cruise's acting prowess but I must say that he seems to be impressing at any point in the film ... not just because of an engaging storyline, but also because he's the one - even entrusted to the main character .. .. they merge and then talk and his beautiful. However, I must say that this film does not belong to the "average film of the weekend" that you choose at random and that you look cheerfully; It carries feelings and strong characters so do not wash it with your beer and your corn-pop. He certainly needs more than that.
