Well, what can I say, except that these people are great in every way. I really like Sharon Mcreedy, I appreciate this nostalgic series. And I have the box of 9 records in 30 episodes, I did not know that they had done so, I also think it's a great shame, they have not done more. I wish these powers to be conferred upon me. Imagine, my cycle is overthrown, somewhere, and stunned by the cold, then I wake up in a special hospital. Later, I discover that my body has been improved. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense to the end. You can not fight these 3 people because they would beat you in all forms of weapons. The music is well written and, for me, gives a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind. The types of powers available to champions are the same as those of our dog or our domestic cat, Enhancing eyesight, Improving hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. When I was little, I had a crush on her !!!! Now, I can see why, on my DVD game. The box is very nice and comes with a free booklet on the series. I also thought that Trymane was a good boss, firm but he made things happen!
