Being the prototype of the classic Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two other brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (what an exquisite beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this film to all those who have even the slightest penchant for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
