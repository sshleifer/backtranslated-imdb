I had seen a "Speed ​​Racer", but I had never really watched it, and I had seen other shows featuring these characters dressed as birds flying a ship called Phoenix and a another turning around a spaceship that looked like a giant ocean. ship and he flew back sometimes for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five years old. This one, even though I watched almost every episode, was amazing to find that this series had some resolution. In fact, the bad guys found themselves in almost all the American cartoons where nothing ends, as in the last episode of Transformers first generation, which ended with Galvatron and this new villain who swore never to get the Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids coming home, with GI Joe with Cobra still out there ready to try again and so on. It ended and featured a cool robot with new weapons as the show progressed. It was a little bland at first, because he could not fly and only had some really cool weapons. Gradually, he had a punching fist like the one used by Android 16 against Cell in Dragonball Z, then this weapon evolved to include razors that exploded. Then the big robot even got wings to fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. He would also have some allies in a female robot and a rather funny robot called Bobo in America. The bad guys did not just understand Dr. Hell, but a really strange person who was half-man, half-woman, and a guy with a head in the air. Interesting show and it was nice to see a conclusion.
