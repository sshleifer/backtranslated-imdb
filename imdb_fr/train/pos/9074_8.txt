The show is really funny. Beautiful theme. The jokes and linings are really good. With few additional tweaks, it can become a very popular show. But the only major negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who the hell has sent Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich? <br /> <br /> Technically, Russell and Jeff are the main characters in the series, which encourages viewers to watch it. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man, relational ... with experience of all the problems that a married couple faces in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - does a horrible job like Jeff, he's not done for the role at all. He is like a robot, there is literally no punch in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> The broadcast is really very important for the viewers. The bad actor will definitely take the show downhill ...
