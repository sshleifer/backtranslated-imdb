I love this movie too. I saw it when it was first shown in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was very crowded and the atmosphere was very ambitious. The eroticism of the film struck the audience and the discussion with Moritz Boerner, producer and director, has always been emphasized by this. In its genre, it was a very ambitious film even when we thought it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of this film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and did two or three Three more shorts were also working for television before it became a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For those wishing to see this film again, you can easily find it on its homepage. search but it is possible.
