I loved growing this show and I still live the DVD of the first season, at the age of 19 years. What can I say? I grew up in a house that looks a lot like Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I guess the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend. In addition, I grew up with my mother at home. I do not know what I would have done without Full House on TV. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace) and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to each of them because I am the child of my family, like Steph, I am a younger sister, like Michelle and I am an older sister, like DJ Like a lot the fact that the show still has moral values ​​because I do not really like OC shows today. I also like the comedy of Full House. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as uncle, friend and father of the girl, respectively. It is said that after the death of the girls' mother, Joey, Danny's best friend, and his brother-in-law, move in to help raise the children. Three men trying to raise three girls = hilarious. Every character in Full House is full of heart, funny and truly believable. Joey is an aspiring comedian with the heart and soul of a child. Jesse is a stout uncle, biker and biker, sweetened by his three nieces and, later, by his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, of Summerville). Children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
