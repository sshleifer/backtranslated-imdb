Years ago, I found a "cheap" copy of this movie for a dollar or two. In many ways, that's quite appropriate, because when it was shot in 1933, it was really a cheap film made by Poverty Row, Majestic. However, even if the film is rather derivative, it deserves ALWAYS to be watched and offers some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very familiar, because in some Germanic cities, people are upset because of recent deaths that seem to be the work of vampires! Dwight Frye adds to this familiarity. He played Renfield at Dracula, and here he is very very similar - although he plays a much more harmless weirdo. In this case, he is obsessed with his bats and people start to blame him for the dead. The film does a good job of providing "red nets" (ie false leads) and although it does not take a genius to understand that Frye may not be responsible, the WHO and why are intriguing and make it VERY different from the average horror movie. Moreover, while the production had little money to talk about, she still had some good actors of the day - Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and she also used Universal Studios' sets at night (when they had finished filming for the day). . As a result, the movie looks pretty good overall, although I also thought that Fay Wray was terrible, as usual. I thought it did not really hurt the movie. I saw her in more movies than most people on IMDb and I found that her characters had no depth - she always seems to be called "screaming lady" and brings little novelty in every movie . <br /> <br /> Overall, for fans of old horror movies, it's excellent and worth the trip. For people who are NOT fans of the genre, it is probably very easy to jump.
