Many of these other viewers complain that the plot of the story has already been tried. This may be the case, but the addition of Dr.Suess's narrator and scenery makes this show a must-see. With adult allusions throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set, the show is both evocative and invigorating. The investigation part of the show is not what drives the viewers. The twisted plot and the lines of love scattered in this apparent paradise are what incites faithful viewers to come back longer. It's a success that ABC should never let go. Bravo ABC. LOST was getting older, a way to revitalize prime time. 9 episodes preceding the writers' strike have left the public wanting more.
