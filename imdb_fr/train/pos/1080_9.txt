Movie "comedies" are nowadays 100 minutes of humor in the toilets, foul language and kicks in the belly. Modern comedies use the lowest common denominator, the slowness and slowness of the brain. Of course, a good occasional comedy will come, but they are becoming more and more rare. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Buildings' home of his dream home" shows what Hollywood was capable of in the 1940s, and it's just funny. . Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut. The film follows their story, starting with house-hunting trips, the unbridled construction of the house, to the completed house - with its "zuzz-zuzz water softener". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny because he sees the house costs disproportionate). However, the film is stolen by the wise Bland lawyer, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Gently able to steal all the scenes in which he finds himself, Douglas is hilarious as he watches the Blandes shift from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as Blandings Architect and Harry Shannon as a former Crisp Water Well Driller are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie a few times and it always made me laugh. I think it's a good movie to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not.
