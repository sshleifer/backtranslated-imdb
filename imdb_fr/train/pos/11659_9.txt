This animated feature (co-produced by Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the most unusual subjects of a film: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic recovery of this story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, living in a monastery run by his uncle, a severe abbot who worries about preparing the Abbey's defenses for the imminent attack of the dreaded forest vikings to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to complete the book. To do this, he unexpectedly finds help from a friendly fairy named Aisling. Beautifully and delicately hand drawn (there are some computer animations), he wants to look like both medieval and traditional Celtic. The art, and with a very creative use of color and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is constantly strange, but it is a good strange, not the kind rebuffing, but the kind of revealing. If one wanted to sketch - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in ninth century Ireland ?? it should be said that the mixture of Catholic mysticism and Celtic paganism in this film never really unites. And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too wide. That's why I can not give them the highest ranking. But these are minor issues with an otherwise delicious and superbly imaginative movie.
