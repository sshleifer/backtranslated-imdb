Whoever says that pokemon is stupid can die. This film is superlative. I even shed a tear when Celebei died. I do not cry a lot! This film is an animating thriller touching. <br /> <br /> In this fourth slice of pokemon, Ash and his friends must prevent the bad reflex from making Celebei the ultimate weapon of evil with its dark ball. In time, Sam and Celebei travel back in time and are continually hunted by game hunters. I like the double battle game and Sam has the apricot pokeball (if you played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I I also liked being able to direct miramax instead of Warner Brothers. Putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea. The pok√©mons of this film come alive more than ever.
