I can not believe I'm watching this movie - I think maybe I thought it was another movie about abused slaves, and I avoided Roots for the same reason - just like I did. I have not seen Schindler's list yet - I do not want to be "entertained" by the pain of other peoples, no matter how authentic or informative. <br /> <br /> So I guess the main thing I noticed about The Color Purple is that it was not about blacks being abused by whites. Blacks were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters - or giving them to be treated as slaves by their "husbands". It was painful to watch, but everyone redeemed themselves in the end, and the acting was phenomenal! I could not believe the character Oprah had played at the age of 35! And I love Whoopi to start - she was amazing. I'm so happy to feel bad yesterday afternoon and Showtime was performing The Color Purple.
