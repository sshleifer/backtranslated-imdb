A successful married man, Harry Mitchell (a superb performance by Roy Scheider) has an affair with young stripper sweet'n'sexy Cini (the gorgeous Kelly Preston). Harry makes a trio of zany hoods sing: the director of the sordid porn theater Raimy (a John Glover gorgeously slimy), the co-owner of the antsy Leo striptease (played by Robert Trebor) and the mad pimp Bobby Shy (a Clarence Williams III terribly intense)) - who filmed his affair with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the hoods kill Cini and give the impression that Harry did it. This in turn triggers a dangerous battle of wit and will between Harry and the hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, adopting a difficult scenario based on Elmore Leonard's crime novel, expertly maintains a steady pace, produces thrilling tension and effectively creates an irresistible atmosphere of terror. The tracks are all consistently excellent, with Ann-Margret in Harry's bitterly neglected wife, Barbara, Vanity in Doreen, a moronic prostitute, and Lonny Chapman in the role of Jim O'Boyle, Harry's loyal business partner. The tight and not mysterious plot keeps the viewers on their guard all the way through. The cruelly profane dialogue, the brilliant cinematography of Jost Vacano, Gary Chang's thrilling score, the harshly amoral tone and the catchy conclusion are also valid for the money. As a bonus, Vanity and Preston undress. A very strong and satisfying small number that is worth checking out.
