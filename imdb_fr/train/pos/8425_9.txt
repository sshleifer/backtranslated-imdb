I finally watched these episodes in 2008 and had to go back and check when they were produced. They are absolutely scary in that they made fun of what would be the future. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed Governor Bush's idiocy, or they are weird and strange people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Bush's friends invade the White House dressed in Arabs carrying rifles? Did Bush "accidentally" execute someone? (No, wait, he sort of did that as a gov.) This may seem like a sitcom failure at the time, but must now be considered a brilliant, though sinister, prescience.
