Saved when it came out, this film is now beautiful and sounds good. A feast of intelligent and thoughtful actors, Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a moving central performance of the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not jump in his eyes and does not show: his long slowness encourages you to listen and think, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity. the worst for that. Too many contemporary films on "historical" themes can not withstand the loss of time. What would Mel Gibson have done with the housekeeper? There are probably a lot of pictures of her slobbering on the grill, then clenching on the barbecue as the flames set in. Preminger does not do anything. The burn is mainly manifested by a guilt reaction. There are some weak performances, but not enough to cause serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and I did not expect to watch it, but I was caught. In our time of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
