Well, this movie is really difficult. To be honest with you, this movie does not contain a lot of captivating story, it does not give you more desire to know how it will end ... but I will tell you something now ... I've never done it. been so tense and jumped into my life! This film certainly offers jumps and thrills! To be honest, I looked at almost midnight, so I was a bit sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was nervous ... or maybe that's because this movie really takes this aspect into consideration! It is essentially a couple who loses their child during a tragic event. They decide to go away and rent a cottage looking for a cabin in the mountains ... They all look peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (I think it's the sister of the main character and that she takes her husband) ... during the night, the husband hears noises ... checks, and that's when things start to go really bad ... they do not remain another day and tell the couple that they must leave as soon as possible, because something is wrong In short, they find out what has happened in this house in recent years and decide to take care of it. <br /> <br /> This is not a Hollywood blockbuster. does it have a huge budget, but please do not be discouraged. It's scary, tense and very very nervous! Just try :)
