I was 5 years old when I saw this musical film on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and I immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it's still an original source of inspiration to achieve the goals I've set since then! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of a tough "hard core" of the entertainment industry During the late '50s, "Sparkle" successfully describes the struggle of three younger sisters in search of their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many aspiring young artists about what could happen when things seem to be happening too fast and models are not available to lend a hand. <br /> <br /> Phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with each song. The three girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, represent the different paths that can be taken, whether they are subject to situations that leave virtually no choice for strong long-term decision making, or that they make the ultimate sacrifice to move forward. when you want to realize your ideal opportunity as a contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This film may have given birth to the idea of ​​creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway and "Glitter" by Mariah Carey 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I saw many similarities in the two stories of "Sparkle", as well as in "Saturday Night Fever", "Fame", "Flashdance" and Broadway hit hit. "Mom, I want to sing."
