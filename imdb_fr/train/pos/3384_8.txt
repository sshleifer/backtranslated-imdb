My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Compare to today's brainless movie (just action and special effect and nothing new on ideas), "Soylent Green" asks something that no longer exists today: think. <br /> <br /> Well it would not be a big surprise one day humans eat "cookies" that are created with a human body. With everything happening on this planet and seeing how indifferent people are to everyone, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film takes time, but the idea behind the film is real again. Rich in paradise, other in hell. Well, luck today is television and an idiot like "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> Television is a good washable brain. It's a shame to see that human intelligence has not progressed like technology. Since you write, stop. <br /> <br /> If you like reality TV, this movie is not for you. If you believe all politicians even. If you do not like, ask yourself questions about the present and the future, never watch this movie.
