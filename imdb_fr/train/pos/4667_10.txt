I recently found this film on VHS after looking for it for several years and I was not disappointed. It improves every time I see it. Peter Ustinov plays the lead role and co-wrote the original script (nominated for an Academy Award). Other stars you've heard about include Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzler, recently released from England's notorious Wormwood Scrubs prison (he had embezzled funds at the Conservative party's seat, chosen because he was a Liberal). He immediately starts looking for a new employer from which he can divert funds and discovers that computers are the way of the future. He enters a club of London men and discovers the identity of the best computer scientists in the city. It steals the identity of a certain CÃ©sar Smith, who has just left the city for South America to pursue his hobby, which is to collect butterflies in the wild. . He goes to Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him the computer center, especially his security device consisting of a blinking blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat his security and the computer tells him obligatorily: "Disconnect the blue light". Using computer hacking techniques from the age of 30, Ustinov enters the system and programs the computer to generate checks from various fictitious companies. The scheme begins to go wrong when Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart), Klemper's assistant, realizes that the number of commercial transactions between Ta-Can-Co and the fraudulent companies of Ustinov seems to be happening. With the help of her secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily ever after. To tell you how would ruin this very funny, romantic, intelligent image and ahead of its time.
