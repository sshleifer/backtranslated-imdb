It is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can have the impression that the film would have little interest, if any, without its presence. <br /> <br /> Despite a mediocre direction. - in fact, many scenes seem to have been shot too quickly and without attention - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about a man who wants to replace a defrocked priest and another week, the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that the we are shocked from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I have never seen nor can imagine a better performance for the future, even Paul Scofield in "A man for all seasons". <br /> <br /> In fact, the end could be considered ridiculous if Fresnay did not play the torn priest who returns to the Church by committing a crime. <br /> <br /> "I am Maurice Morand, Catholic priest" ("I am Maurice Morand, a Catholic priest") is said with such brilliance that we can forget the crazy The other impressive thing about this film is a unique scene in which Morand - although he is a defrocked - remains a priest - consecrates in a cabaret an enormous amount of vine transforming it into the blood of Christ. <br /> <br /> Gerard - the man who wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him by himself - must drink it if he does not want to leave it in the cabaret. He does so amid the applause and applause of people who think he's just drinking three or four vines. <br /> <br /> In the following scene, the dialogue between Morand and a garbage man is also remarkable. "Do you also bring men?" Morand asks, hating what he has just done. "It would be too much work" is the smart answer. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not worth commenting on, but it is definitely worth seeing because of the very strong and strangely emotional atmosphere created all the time. <br /> <br /> I think "Defrocked" is a very strange film, but it must be seen by all viewers - if they are good Catholics, it's obligatory - because it's a jewel very rare in the history of cinema. <br /> <br />
