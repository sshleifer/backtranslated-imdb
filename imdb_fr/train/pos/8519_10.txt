Amazing ..... It may be a bad attempt to redo the already recreated movie Omen, but I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This last man who commented is a fool, this movie was one of Jerry Goldsmith himself would have applauded this movie. <br /> <br /> Good recommendations from myself to watch or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror movies So listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that does not fascinate me, the ends. <br /> <br /> According to the prophecy, it's all inaccurate, including the final conflict, and left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion being ... There are great movies ... and should be seen, before the Great Depression falls on us and before the Democrats Also take the chair. <br /> <br /> So signed .... Jacob Eder ... A farmer, with a brain.
