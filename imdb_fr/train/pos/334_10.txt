It's very simple to qualify this movie: "A PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of this time, 1100 BC. They perfectly personalize the characters. A second reason is that the production expresses well the poetry expressed by Homer in his poem. Among other things, the stories made by the choir give a special atmosphere that makes us part of the artistic rendition. Third reason: the reconstruction of the setting is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean regions, where the action of the poem has occurred. And above all, the emotion is at the rendezvous. I reiterate my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERPIECE".
