This has great points, but the length of the movie does not help keep the plot thin. It's another sailor movie on leave, faster than Astaire's "Follow the Fleet" but not as good as "On The Town". <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is bland but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their number "If you knew Susie" is hilarious because they compose the song as they sing it. "I begged her" is also fun with Sinatra, which shows how much he was adept at sabotaging. Sinatra's solo songs are monotonous and seem to be inserted to show her singing rather than as part of the story. Luckily, there are famous actors like Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an improbable but imperturbable Jose Iturbi as such to watch. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the movie, although Third Bill and it is interesting to see him interact with the children, which Astaire has never done. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and attaches to Kelly's character. He also goes to a school where he tells the children a fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian Navy (!), Which leads to his wonderful dance with a lively Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he dances a charming Mexican hat dance with a little girl with a sublime and serious face, Sharon McManus, captivating and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice then but a bit too long. A taste of the best upcoming musicals.
