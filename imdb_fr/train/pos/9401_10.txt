What a wonderful film, so eligible for so many labels that it never gets: Science fiction, film noir, with a script and dialogue of great intelligence that assumes an educated and cultured audience ..... the genre English-language film made only in pre-1960 England (shown only in United States art cinemas upon arrival) and never made in the United States. <br /> <br /> Key Figures from The Man In The White Suit (1951) with Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood commonly use polysyllabic and scientific terms like "polymer" and discuss and explain chemistry concepts such as "molecules long chain ", then communicate the importance to the average man and the benefits that science provides him. <Br /> <br /> The man in the white suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game explosion movies that now dominate the world cinema and certainly dominate the big American cinemas. an intelligently told story delivered by gifted and credible educated English actors (who pla (educated and accomplished people), and everything is done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony that Greek playwrights would have approved. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this film and, one day or another, a filmmaker worthy of the name and his followers should do another. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful.
