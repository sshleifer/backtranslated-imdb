Let's get right to the point: this is the movie I would take with me on a desert island (with DVD player). It's just perfect. If a reason for you to see a movie is that you like actors, you like to see them free to involve in space and feelings, this movie is for you. See the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) gets intoxicated and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because she no longer follows the script. If you are sensitive to camera movement, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, the particular flow that gives you the impression that the camera follows the actors as if it were directed by the theatrical principle of " "private space" "... unbelievable, and the story is just a brilliant mix of storytelling and realistic drama." Cassavetes argues again with Hollywood and the majors' politics, but this time he does it through Broadway, making it one of the most exciting movies on the stage.Well, this movie is a bliss.
