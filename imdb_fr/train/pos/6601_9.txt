This film is absolutely beautiful. A new Blade Runner - the black future is the hardest. The vision of Paris is superb, both recognizable and visionary, with panoramic views, dark scenes and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, with few surprises, but it's not what I like most about the movie. It's a visual treat. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and rendered in black and white (no gray!) with a single spot of color, it is less hard to look at than it seems. There are many "arty" camera shots - close-ups and strange views - but that only adds to the movie's temperament. Overall, you have the impression of a graphic novel in the form of footage. <br /> <br /> I initially felt that the film had been rotoscoped, it was the level of animation and the high level of detail of the character's facial expressions. But unlike "A Scanner Darkly" - who suffers from a definition of incoherent character (or even reinforced by it) (simply observe the evolution of the shape of the hair!) - Renaissance is coherent and precise. When the character is in close-up, additional details and texture are visible, but mid-way or further, the details are omitted, but not at the expense of the character's definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only drawback of the film is that, in a comment, we are told that it is a unique project. Too bad, because I would like to see more this futuristic plot of black film and especially in this avant-garde graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English dub is awesome too. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good movie and highly recommended.
