Herbet Clutter, his wife Bonnie, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much appreciated and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early morning hours of November 14, 1959, they were both brutally murdered. Quite unexpectedly, the crime impressed the author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the progress of the case to its conclusion. The result was the book IN Cold Blood. Controversial, shocking and exceptionally well written, it has become an international bestseller and remains a touchstone for perpetrators of crime. <br /> <br /> The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many real-life venues, it is slightly documentary, glossy and detached - and the cast is exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor is rightly based. As a killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a deep disgust and the shock of unexpected sympathy. it's a masterful performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less good. <br /> <br /> Like Capote's book, the film begins with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and drive them to Clutter's home - and then suddenly go through the crime of detailing the investigation which ultimately led to their arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film has always been when we finally see what happened in Clutter House; filmed in the Clutter House itself, this is a breathtaking, horrible and deeply disturbing sequence. <br /> <br /> The director and screenwriter Richard Brooks guides the film with a very strong sense of deliberation, wandering only in the sense that it allows the film to become slightly preached. Given the overall power of the film, however, it becomes an insignificant nuisance. Strong tips - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
