In fact, this movie was not so bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy of "The Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, of "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx in the role of Alvin, who was pretty good and funny, but the one that surprised me the most is David Morse in the role of Edgar Clenteen. He plays a character different from the one he is used to playing, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers", he plays a very friendly, and in "Bait", the rooms on the contrary, a man without any emotion, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this film is the different images of the World Trade Center, which may give this movie a bit of a tired look. Overall, I thought it was a very good little movie!
