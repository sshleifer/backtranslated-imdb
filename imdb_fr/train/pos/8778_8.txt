James J. Corbett, World Heavyweight Champion from 1892 to 1897, proved to be the favorite role of Errol Flynn. Maybe because he did not have to brandish a sword or be in a western. He had enough swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was a failure in the westerns and that he did not understand why people liked him. It's a nice movie, but it barely tells the true story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> As described, Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, a man who used his brain and his speed more than brute force to win . He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown. He was also a compulsive womanizer and looked a lot like the man who represented him. Of course, this was not displayed on the screen. The character of Alexis Smith, the banker's daughter who falls in love with him, has no basis in reality. Corbett was actually married twice and was clearly unfaithful to both of his wives. <br /> <br /> In addition, after losing his title and after the events of this film, he suffered a great personal tragedy. His father was in a moment of depression, probably over his finances, because he had relied heavily on his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons, to slaughter his mother and then turn against him. The murder / suicide does not correspond to the happy clan presided over by Alan Hale. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I liked about Gentleman Jim. Ward Bond had the career role of his life playing John L. Sullivan. Director Raoul Walsh got Bond's excellent performance as Sullivan, a boastful but adorable fan. Even though some of Sullivan's negatives do not appear on the screen as rabid racism, Bond's portrait is John L.'s quintessential and the best thing about Gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one thing that should have been said is that Sullivan, as a champion, refused, for racing reasons, to meet Peter Jackson, Black, native of Australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time. I say probably because, as a challenger, Corbett met him and played 61 laps tied. This fight more than any other has created a demand for a match for the Sullivan-Corbett title. Of course, when Corbett was a champion, he refused to give the title to Jackson. Maybe he did not want another 61-round marathon with someone who could have been better that day. <br /> <br /> The gentleman Jim is not the story of Jim Corbett, it is a film of Errol Flynn playing the role of James J Corbett But Corbett, if he had been alive in 1942 , would have probably liked the film and the portrait of his life by Flynn. It's like he would have liked to be remembered.
