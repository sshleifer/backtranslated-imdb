When I saw this film for the first time on cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I am a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film paints a faithful picture of the South and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, a former plantation owner who uses convicts for work. Soll is what makes things happen, his funny speeches give us a glimpse of how the South was at the time. I guess if Soll lived today, he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitude towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. Although he has racist views, he has learned to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two most trusted convicts are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best of the film, they have a real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler, both very talented, but also with Hass. <br /> <br /> This film should have gained more notoriety. However, it's on DVD and it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
