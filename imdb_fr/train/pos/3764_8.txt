Okay, I'll admit it - I'm an idiot and I sometimes love a really silly comedy. Although I have seen more films from Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than anyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for a polished comedy that does not try to be sophisticated, but is simply funny. Some of these movies that immediately come to my mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE SAINT-GRAIL, UHF, START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW and the movies Bill and Ted. They all lack snobbery, but only a zombie critic or a professional movie critic may not like them. <br /> <br /> Even though BOGUS JOURNEY by BILL & TED is not as wonderful as Bill and Ted's original movie, it's still fun. In addition, unlike the original, it actually seems that the results are improved with repeated visualizations. I remember not loving the movie the first time I saw it - maybe because the other movie set such a high level of laughter. But, every time I see him, I am amazed by all the highlights, especially those involving the Reaper. And by the way, this mower is about as different from Bergman's in THE SEVENTH SEAL! In addition to a lot of laughs, this film contains excellent music, making it a quality superior to the first film. Kiss's anthem at the end is awesome, but the rest of the hard rock tunes are too, provided you're not a deadly old love like De Nomolos. Great visualization for children and adults.
