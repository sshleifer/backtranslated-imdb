Magnificent cult film of 1979 in which students of Vince Lombardi high school are confronted with a new director, dictatorial, named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a hater of music and blames the students' musical tastes for their transgressions. Riff Randell (PJ Soles), the Ramones' No. 1 fan, wants the rock band to record their songs. <br /> <br /> movie impossible to resist. First and foremost, the soundtrack is amazing, with songs from artists such as Alice Cooper and The Velvet Underground, in addition to the infectious assortment of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a punk rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. Then the cast really gives it all, Soles being an ideal choice for Riff's role; she is a real delight. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are serious as Tom and Kate, Woronov is well placed against Togar and Togar, Snint and disdainful, Clint Howard has one of his best roles as Eaglebauer contractor occupying a toilet, and New World regulars like Dick Miller. Paul Bartel (especially fun as a music teacher, Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun, as always. And, of course, it's a treat to see the Ramones play themselves. <br /> <br /> The film has a real spirit. The energy level is high, and co-author and director Allan Arkush has brought a lot of flair to the proceedings. There is also a great sense of humor. The gag of the paper airplane is an excellent example. This extends to the style of "sweeping" scene transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects, including Rob Bottin, at one of his first gigs. <br /> <br /> A film as good as a defender of authority can defend itself. get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a wonderful cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
