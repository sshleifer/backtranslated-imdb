The last time I saw the movie, I was about seven years old. My opinion might be tired with time. At the time, I enjoyed the shoot that rocked between the cartoon and the film. At the time, I felt sad for the blue camel and its sad life. I also felt joy when, after Captain Contagious had kidnapped the heroine (a princess or a toy shepherdess), the tables were turned over. Unfortunately, the producers have never decided to transfer this film on VHS. All my memories are twenty years old. I'm sure if I saw the movie again, I would consider it silly and sullen, but the movie really appealed to me a lot at the time.
