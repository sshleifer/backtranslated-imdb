It's one of the funniest movies I've seen. there were some raw moments, but they were full of charm. his altmanesque scenario, his brilliant physical humor and his relaxed friendships have been a pleasure to watch and a slice of life that most of us can understand. and I can say with some honesty that I was scared for Steve Carell's nipple..I was really so. Surprisingly, this is a no-nonsense and cheerful comedy that focuses on love and the many relationships we might find ourselves in along the way. Catherine Keener was great as Trish and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but kind and fun. the idea that they suspect Carell of being a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming and very fun. highly recommended.
