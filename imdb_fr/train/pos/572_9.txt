In response to the person who said that the movie was hanging around and that there was no reason for Jess's brother's role to be there, here's my answer: <br /> <br /> Jess's brother's role is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have predicted the problems associated with everyday life by examining the fate of Jess's brother. There are several cases where Brad Pitt and his life go side by side, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to a disjointed bar and then finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there and the character of Craig Sheffer would have more emotional sorrow at the death of his brother, knowing that he could have done more to avoid it and then create a more convincing atmosphere in the film.
