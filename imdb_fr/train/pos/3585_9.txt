Great story about teenagers, leaders, high school football "stars". How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie, kill? How much can you lose if you are harassed by an innocent girl? Can love beat the odds? Can you defeat the inhabitants of a small town with narrow ideas? When your friend scores and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to make her pay, or will you be a man on this subject and will you respect the right to choose? Are you going to rape her and show her as your victory over a "problem" girl? Do you think that one who has only sin is to have his own opinion, to make his own decisions, to choose himself? It made me think twice before deciding who was right and who was wrong, but one of them is: the film and the theme very disturbing in general. Thumb up!
