Certainly one of the craziest and most twisted I have ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and allowed me to continue the whole affair. <br /> <br /> The very elegant decorations and the accessories really give an atmosphere to the debates. The minimalist feel applies to the entire image. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it is not the film itself, but the lack of a decent, widescreen DVD movie. I have the full screen version (which proves that I like the movie enough to support a full-screen presentation), but an impressive Deluxe or 'special' edition would certainly have my money.
