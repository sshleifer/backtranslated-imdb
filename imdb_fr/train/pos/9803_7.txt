This Batman movie is not quite as good as the Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it's still a good part of the Batman cartoons. I say it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This film is good for all the same reasons. The scenario is good, not quite as good as the previous movie, but still pretty good, it has a lot of action. The effects of comics are good The voice of the actors is really good, like that of Kevin Conroy in Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The bad guys are good like Kyra Sedgwick in Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers in The Pequin, Hector Elizondo in Bane. So, I'm sure you will not be disappointed by Batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So be sure to rent or buy the Batman Mystery movie of The Batwoman because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ******* on ********* * <br /> <br /> *** on *****
