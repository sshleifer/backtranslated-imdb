This movie that I loved since I was young! It's excellent. Although it may seem a little difficult for an average viewer if we can not interpret certain subtleties in the film (for example, our hero is called Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander, he shot in the heel with a rocket, just as Achilles in mythology was hit in the heel). It's just a little fun fact. Anyway, good movie, good story, it would be nice to see it redone with the special effects of today! Curiously, Gary Graham was an average success, playing in the television series Alien Nation. This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!
