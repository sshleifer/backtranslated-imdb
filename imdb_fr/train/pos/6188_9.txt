An investigation into a murder continues as The Vanities, on its opening night, performs in front of an unknown audience. A strange combination of musical mystery and murder deserves a glance for his casting, his production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael plays the leading role of a bitchy actress determined to end the marriage. between the stars of the series, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as in the famous number "Sweet Marijuana" (which also appeared on a Bette Midler album of the 70s). So while the choir girls hang out behind the scenes, the embarrassing detective Victor McLaglen eyes them as he tries to solve the murder behind the scenes of a stranger. <br /> <br /> We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from far away, that the wardrobe (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) plays a determining role. Many intrigues are writhing among the musical numbers. The best known song of the show is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the obsession "Where do they come from?" And there is a strange rhapsody bursting into a Harlem special issue with Duke Ellington! All the casting. <br /> <br /> Great actors, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is fine too. Brisson is a total of zero though. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor and see if you can see Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls.
