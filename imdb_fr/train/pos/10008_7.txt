You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly pulling himself in the foot with all those stupid comedies he's been doing this decade (with the possible exception of "Death To Smoochy", which bombed when he was released but which is now a classical cult). The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, including "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener", despite mediocre reviews and a quick release on DVD, is part of his best work, period. <br /> <br /> The story is very scary, even if it includes neither a serial killer nor anyone else that is physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on a case of fraud that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read the autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who was horribly abused and eventually contracted AIDS. The story moved me until I read online reports that Johnson might not exist. When I saw this film, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly described resurfaced in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance also as a finally sociopathic "guardian". Her role was very different from those she had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". There were even moments when she looked at the camera where I thought she was looking straight at me. It takes a good actress to play this kind of role, and it is this role underestimated (and yet well reviewed) that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation who have not even been nominated for an Academy Award (from 2008). . It's amazing that there is at least one woman in this world who is like that, and it's scary too. <br /> <br /> It's a good dark film that I highly recommend. Prepare to be disturbed, as this film leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.
