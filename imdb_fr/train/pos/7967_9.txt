It's certainly one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It's a real pleasure for everyone. This will make you laugh, make you cry and put you in suspense. <br /> <br /> Basically, Homeward Bound talks about three pets that are sent to live on a farm. while their owners go on vacation. They do not know what's going on and desperately want to go home. They escape from the farm and try to find their way in the nature. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last films Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and sympathetic golden retriever. Sally Field also starred in this film and provided the voice of Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, this movie is about luck! Expressed by Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor of all time), Chance is all you expect from a dog, loveable, playful, energetic and clumsy, and every time I fall in love watching this movie, it's thanks to Chance; it's as if comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This film is also very sad sometimes. It sometimes reminds people that they have been alone or that they have lost their pets. <br /> <br /> A scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio tries to escape from the pound; I am particularly shocked by the part where Chance has his collar stuck in the fence and hardly does it. The film had other moments of suspense, but none seemed as moving as this one. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great family film. If you liked this movie, you will surely love the sequel. I give this film a solid 9 out of 10!
