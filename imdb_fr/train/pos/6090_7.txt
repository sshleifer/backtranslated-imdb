The envy is not as funny as I thought at first, but after some reviews I read, I thought it was a lot funnier than what people were giving it. but ben stiller and black jack work well with each other and christopher walken is still great. The story is about the character of Jack Black inventing a spray that removes the smell of dog. Of course, ben does not want to, but when the product makes black jack rich ben stiller begins to see the envy, it's not great and ben stiller and jack black have the funniest and best movies to their belt, but if you're a fan of one or the other, I recommend it because his film is always funny and I burst out laughing many times, as a big fan of ben stiller, I must say that it's less serious but still very fun, give him a watch
