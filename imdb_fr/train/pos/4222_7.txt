I love this episode, Ruth Gordon is good if it is a little hammered as it has always been. As it has been said, the music is very good and has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. <br /> <br /> But there is a major chasm in the plot, so wide that it is possible to drive a fleet of trucks there. It is established that the light does not work in the safe. Do not you think that the very smart Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the bulb worked? One would think that in no time, they would have unscrewed the bulb and found the note. Admittedly, it's television fiction, and we'll always find holes, but it seems too obvious. <br /> <br /> This does not make Columbo the hidden genius when the light does not work but the testimony of the "death bed" remains unfounded, apparently for days.
