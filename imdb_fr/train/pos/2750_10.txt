This is the kind of movie the US does not do. That's why people rent foreign movies. It's a beautiful story about how a person, even if it is delayed, can get a person to find the reason in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people with intellectual disabilities suffer in their lives and shows them in a very realistic way (I think). Like its classic in foreign films, this film has a bittersweet ending, but it makes for a better movie.
