Much like a very primitive episode of "The General Hospital" that takes place in a natal ward (and another for difficult cases), this quick programmer has a satisfying emotional impact - mainly because Eric Linden, the young husband distraught from the main plot is so obviously a wreck and with such good reason. His future wife, Loretta Young, is brought into the room at the start of a 20-year prison sentence for inflicting a crime that he may have heard from him. As always, Ms. Young does nothing to dissuade the public from feeling the sympathy of the public. She is a little too beautiful to be true, although nice and pleasant to watch, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and her relationships with the other girls in the room are the heart of the film. The result - not quite happy - seems self-evident. Aline MacMahon, "one of the few perfect movie actresses", in the words of film historian David Thomson, exudes warmth and authority when the head nurse and Glenda Farrell, an unwanted new mum of twins, arrives to Croon "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh appears in another sub-plot and shows a range greater than that which Warners usually allowed him. He's moderate and modestly paced, and Linden's future-dad panic haunts you - this kind of role has often been played to laugh, but it's a terrified boy who has problems and is very persuasive.
