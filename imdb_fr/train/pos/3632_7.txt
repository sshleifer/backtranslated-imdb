As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie is a solid outing. Dennis Quaid, the most reasonable jock actor who works today, is absolutely perfect as a science teacher turned baseball player, Jimmy Morris. The film is never designed for children, as one would expect from a G-rated movie. As a sports film, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen since Any Given Sunday.
