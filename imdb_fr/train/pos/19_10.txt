I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and I feel that I have to intervene here. I understand that he does not like the movie, but his reasons are not obvious. My feeling about this film is that it is not afraid to walk the darkest roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and grief. As described above, each of these two people has many reasons to be bitter and angry, while finding sweetness and comfort in the other. Only a great acting game could do this job without becoming an emotional, sentimental and sappy quagmire. I was really interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity that gave them such performances. I have every reason not to like Jane Fonda for her actions of the Vietnamese era, but apart from her personal feelings, she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and kindness begin to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first time that DeNiro uses tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like him. This film was a big surprise when I first saw it and I can not wait to see it again.
