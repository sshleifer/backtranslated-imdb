Riding Giants is an incredible documentary detailing the story and stories of three influential surfers with big waves, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has done a great job in assuming the role of director and should be commended for her excellent work. The structure of the film is brilliantly edited and works perfectly with narration, interviews, animation and surfing images. The soundtrack of the music only adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making Riding Giants brilliant. Highlights include comments by Greg Noll, his direct franchise, Laird Hamilton's Teahupoo, and the catches at the end of the film. But in reality, all this movie is a big strong point recommended which is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see it. It's a shame, it's not better known, but it's a jewel that deserves attention. 10/10
