I'm a pretty big fan of most Stephen King-based movies - this one is considered one of the scariest and most memorable. <br /> <br /> I just saw him for the tenth or so I still find it heartbreaking and scary. <br /> <br /> The scene where Gage is on a certain collision course with the monster truck is remarkable. And the "Not Fair" pronounced by little Miko Hughes towards the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
