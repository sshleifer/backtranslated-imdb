I must say that I really did not know that I was going to sit and watch this movie. I guess it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between classes. But, for once, a TV movie has aroused my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my attention. I was really not a big fan of her before this movie. Of course, I liked Twister and as good as possible. But something about this movie really did it for me. I would see myself now as a big fan. This movie comes with high notes of ... me. Give him a chance, he will not let you down.
