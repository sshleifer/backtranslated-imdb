I saw this movie for the first time when it came out in 1994 and I just watched it recently and it is ALWAYS funny. I do not know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90s, but it will help if you understand it. In the '90s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal conflicts within groups and members when their separate ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There were also the wanna b's, accessible rappers who start making the stage (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams of C & C Music Factory, etc.). This film makes fun of it all in a way that seems like a documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends a year in the life of a fictional rap group, N.W.H. Members of the band are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Tasty Taste (Larry Scott / Revenge of the Nerds) and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are a promising rap band whose politics make them controversial. What's good about this film is that it's so rich in its description of the 80's hip-hop industry and how it makes fun of him. But if you know the rap of the 80s / 90s, you know how true this stuff is. Yet, alone, without knowledge of hip-hop, it's still a funny and funny movie. And for all those who ask, yes, Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first parody movie either. In my opinion, it's just as funny and, in some ways, better than Spinal Tap. As Spinal Tap is heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet is Rap. And the songs are also out of play. The DVD is chalk-filled with supplements to include NWH's music videos as a band and as solo artist, outstanding performances of Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
