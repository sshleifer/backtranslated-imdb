It's only 2 episodes of a 5-episode drama, but I can already say it's one of the best things I've ever seen. Whether on TV, on the big screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good he's almost demoralizing! As a spectator, it's so much fun that I'm pissed off, the episodes last more than a fortnight instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negative aspects are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern man who has previously returned to a television series. Compared with movies, TV shows always seemed dated, rather tame, and well, generally boring! "Five Days" has really introduced drama into the 21st century, so for me at least, it changes. Go look at him.
