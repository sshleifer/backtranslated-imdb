The documentary presents an original theory on "Firearms, germs and steel". The series graphically depicts several episodes firmly supporting the theory and defending it against current critics. <br /> <br /> I was deeply puzzled to see user comments complaining about the lack of new information in this series. They say that the documentary presents information taught at the college. Indeed, he does. In fact, I really enjoyed the original look at the information I had known since college and the unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So if you like to know WHY things work, if you took the phone apart, try to figure out how it worked, if you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this series. A definitive recommendation.
