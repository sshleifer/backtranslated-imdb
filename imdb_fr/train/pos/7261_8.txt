I strongly disagree with "ctomvelu" regarding Jim Belushi's talent. I really like Belushi. Certainly, I was skeptical when he appeared on the scene, because I was a huge fan of his late brother John. But Jim has a charm on the screen that has taken him a long way - and he has developed it well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of her previous films - her weight is a gift (is not it true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it's touching and comforting, so if you like car chases, explosions and free sex, you might want to pass on this one - it's a warm film of three lost soles that end up. Do not get me wrong, I'm very supportive of the above three keys to a blockbuster movie, but I also like a nice solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch offer great performances, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter - which is absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to his career, but whoever is responsible for the fall of the ball (agent? parents? herself?) should be shot. You can not ask for an introduction to celebrity more perfect than this movie, and yet nothing remarkable has been told since. <br /> <br /> Another sad story in Hollywood ...
