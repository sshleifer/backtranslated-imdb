Intelligent, ironic and exciting, "The Invisible Man" stood out in the year 2000 among Sci-Fi's usual programming, balancing the fantastic artistic direction of "Farscape" and its sometimes melodramatic scenario with cynical intrigues and a modern black dialogue. The show was between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility counter, but there was no denying that the characters in "I-Man" went beyond caricature. Even characters close to predictability, such as the Guardian, the Official, and Eberts, were allowed re-runs of the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and evolved with elegance, made even more remarkable by the team of writers and directors of the revolving door. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot, and science has sometimes only grazed the incredible. The weak points of the series are always fun and I have never seen such pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi have to be congratulated, and fans have the right to demand a full edition of the show on DVD. Whenever I meet a marathon of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" on Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh, crying out the excitement and possibility of the science-fiction television represented by "Invisible Man".
