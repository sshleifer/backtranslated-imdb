Warning: Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie and you intend to do so, stop reading here and trust me. You must see this movie. I've seen it four times so far and still have not made a decision as to exactly what happened in the film. That's all I'm going to say because if you have not seen this movie, stop reading right away. <br /> <br /> If you read again, I will ask you a few questions and maybe if someone has all the answers you can send me an email and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember very well my 11th grade English teacher. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this devious way to teach you things that maybe you were not too passionate about. If we did not like Shakespeare, he turns history into a modern romance with modern language so that we can understand it. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book during our free time. It was his indelible way of marking something in our spongy minds. <br /> <br /> I start this review of Vanilla Sky by a description of this brilliant man, because he has already entrusted to us a task that was firmly engraved in my memory, like the phone number of a best friend since long lost, and that finally made sense to me after watching The Matrix. If I did not know it better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really only a pseudonym for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. But by giving them the benefit of the doubt, we will assume that it is not him. But it was the first time this mission was more intangible. <br /> <br /> He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that it was good. Show me how you can say you are real. This allowed the class to start all the usual ideas you can imagine, I'm sure. Everything from pain to touch, loss and hunger was thrown at our teacher to prove that we were real. After each scenario we had exposed him, he would come back with the answer that would leave us speechless. <br /> <br /> "What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What if you were someone else's dream? What a messy question it is. It was a question / scenario that was put to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid development of computers. How could it seem then? But if you look at the current technology, ask yourself now how this dream was part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive has explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes further than any other movie. In short, it's a film that will literally leave you speechless by all the possibilities around you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young canon, fair, editorial and owner of several magazines. He inherited from his father and although he has talent and business acumen, his board, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich boy born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel that he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each one of them thinks he has to go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we met one of David's sumptuous toys, Julie Gianni, played with a pernicious but dazzling perfection of Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claiming that they are only there to use each other and that they are not at all interested in a monogamous and engaged relationship. This is the type of relationship at the height of David's other adventures in the sex life of his age. And although the two speak a good game, we can say that only one really says the truth. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius Kevin Smith's good friend Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish, but they are also very good friends. It's something that David has very little in his life and you can feel a real concern for others from the beginning of the film. Brian has a famous phrase that he keeps repeating to David. And it's "the sweet is not so sweet without the bitter." He goes on to tell him that one day he would find true love and not just that part-time lover's status that he seems to be perpetrating with all the dogs in his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> At David's big birthday party (so huge that Steven Spielberg wishes him a happy birthday), Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played by Penelope Cruz of course with this which must be this year's best performance of an actress. . This is just an invitation, and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued by each other. And in the typical David way, despite the presence of his best friend, he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate matters, Julie introduces herself without being invited and begins to spy on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of each other. There is no hanky panky. The next day, while David leaves Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers to drive her and from there ... well, I think we all saw the commercials. <br /> <br /> That's all I'm really going to say about the plot, because from there, the movie makes fun of reality and fuzzy perception. We discover a character played by Kurt Russel and some other shady characters who all play a role in this labyrinth. There is a subtext of death and panacea as a panacea that can or can not create the possibility of eternal life. This is one of the fascinating possibilities that the film offers us, but it does not stop there. <br /> <br /> As many movies seem to thrive today, this movie has a secret. Sixth Sense may have started this craze, but look further back and you may be able to thank Angel Heart for launching this craze. Whatever its origin, Vanilla Sky has one of its own surreptitious intestinal busters. And what makes this movie so much fun is that the film gives you many clues along the way, but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the glove of the truth and the lies you've just conquered. I saw this film four times and each time because I wanted to see if there was anything more that I could find, something more than I can understand. Being able to work in the theater, allowing him to open up to new possibilities is a rare thing in a film. All ersatz said "Best pictures of the year" were good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A beautiful spirit was intriguing but flat, the Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity, because it's a film that leaves you wanting even more, but which guarantees your satisfaction, because the film and those who made it love. I know this film has received mixed reviews, but I just think that those who do not like it do not understand it very well. <br /> <br /> That's what movie making should look like. That's what a movie is supposed to do to you. It's supposed to make you feel something. Most of this year's other films are just empty spaces. This one is not. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 The best movie of the year. I would love to see this movie being nominated for Best Picture and see Cruz as Best Actress, Diaz for Best Support, Cruise for Best Actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe should also participate. None of this can happen, and it's a shame. It's a film not to be missed. <br /> <br /> And finally, I'm sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe it's the film that could answer his question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just the fruit of someone's imagination? Are we transplanted artificially for the inconvenience of someone else? It's a film that generates more questions than answers. And I'm sure it suits him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
