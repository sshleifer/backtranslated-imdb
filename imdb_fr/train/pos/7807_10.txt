The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is perfectly NATURAL, that's what the movie game should be; and the staging technique is so brilliantly mastered in every detail that I am never tired of seeing it again and again. However, I am a little surprised to see that this film does not appear in the credits of Attenborough which puzzles me: are not they proud to claim to have made such an excellent and lasting film for the public film? I hope to get answers to my riddles from someone (possibly a member of the "competent" (initiated) staff of the film.
