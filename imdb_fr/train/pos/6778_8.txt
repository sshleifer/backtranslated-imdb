A melodrama that we fondly remember ?? thank you mainly to the great central performance of Ronald Colman, winner of an Oscar ?? on a theme often treated: the nature of the game and how it can exceed the perception of reality. In this case, we have a big spy who tackles "Othello" by Shakespeare, so that the last third of the film actually plunges into the genre of thriller? with the press agent Edmond O'Brien (who happens to be really fascinated by Colman's co-star and ex-wife, Signe Hasso), "investigating" the possible involvement of the actor in the strangulation, similar in Desdemona, a waitress looking for celebrities (a very thin Shelley Winters). The post-war theatrical and New York atmosphere is dramatically captured by the screenwriters of Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and the legendary "director" of the actor, George Cukor (all recognized by the Academy with nominations); the film also won a second Oscar for the eclectic score of Miklos Rozsa. Colman, forever the sweet-headed man blessed elsewhere with a velvety voice, does pretty well by Shakespeare ?? he is convinced that the more his character slips into obsessive jealousy, murderous rage and, possibly, paranoia; However, he is not discouraged by a cast that also includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and coroner Whit Bissell. Although the middle part is a little tense, the film compensates for any gap by an expressionist denouement with remarkable treatment.
