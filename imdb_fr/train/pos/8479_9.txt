Watching it many times as a child was a unique experience 15 years ago, and now that I've found it, it still has a cinematic experience like few others. If risky, it's an excellent display of morality and recommended life lessons to look at family with young children. Although it is still adulthood, I have been lucky enough to have learned several times in previous years. Trying to find it today is hard enough. . . but believe me, it's worth it, no matter how old you are. In particular, cartoonists will find an excellent entry into Masami Hata's filmography. With impressive works of art and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a rewarding experience. While some lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in English, the score is nevertheless captivating. But even the dubbing is much better than what came out today. Unfortunately, RCA Columbia Home Video no longer has an impression in the mid-1980s and, to my knowledge, has not received a new version, at least in the United States. Look hard and you will be very satisfied! It is an artistic, intense, pleasant and important landmark in Japanese animation.
