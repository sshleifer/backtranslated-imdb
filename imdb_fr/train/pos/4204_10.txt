and whoever is watching this film will agree. This film was made at the time when the plot, the credibility of the characters and the theme really mattered. <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter steal the show. Ritter is in great shape as an informant "Moe", she survives in the Bowery section of New York, acting as a black pigeon for the New York police. <br /> <br /> The only other film I saw in Peters is "Niagara", and it certainly proves its ability to act here, with the Brooklyn accent. Widmark is justifiably threatening, as an anti-hero who must discern what is good, despite his need for liquidity. <br /> <br /> The photography is brilliant. Neon, the subway station (although it looks cleaner than the real thing!) The harbor hut where Widmark lives like an ephemeral. The city is very well used, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; the many tastes and appetites of the city are discussed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10.
