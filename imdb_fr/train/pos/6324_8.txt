These guys are anything but the usual suspects! These are lots of nice jobs that you would like to see go away, but they are so unlucky that there is very little chance of this happening. Nobody is better than William H. Macy to represent the man with the big heart This is probably his best performance since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played to perfection the boxer meathead, and the rest of the gang was still good. Luis Guzman brought a great comic relief as Cosimo and George Clooney stole all the scenes from the movie. his cameo role. The heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The direction was also well staged by the Russo brothers. There was definitely a feeling of the Coen brothers in the film all along and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers. They still have a long way to go to match Coen's, but it's a great start and I look forward to their next celluloid release. ....... "Yo mutha is a whore"!
