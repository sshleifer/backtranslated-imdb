This movie was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than I had already planned. It was really a spectacular ripping movie. It's an incredible story, with incredible actors and creators. It's really another good movie with Denzel Washington. (should not surprise anyone) Derek Luke has also done a great job.
