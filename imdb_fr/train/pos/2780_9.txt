Great movie -I loved it. Excellent editing and use of the soundtrack. Capture the true feeling of Indian life, but we can all understand. A well chosen cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters so that you all love them and that you feel that you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is excellent and the direction really works, because everyone seems real and natural. You can not help but pamper Jess in this movie! The acting game was really good, even the tomboy walk and the body posture of the two main women are very convincing as a person who plays a lot of football.
