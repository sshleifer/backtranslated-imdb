It's certainly one of my favorite episodes of Trek. There is so much in this one movie that it's really cool. First, the guys teleport themselves to an extraterrestrial planet about to explode. They meet a weird guy librarian type (very well played). Then, Kirk manages to be transported again on what looks very much like the Earth of the 16th century. McCoy and Spock try to follow but are almost spoiled on the frozen version of the extraterrestrial world 100,000 years ago. Kirk manages to be locked up and accused of witchcraft while Spock has a good time with a sexy cave that has been defeated by this terrible world frozen by a villain. <br /> <br /> Spock decides at and gives McCoy a royal assert, assuming the doc suggests he look for a way out. Anyway, they all end up escaping, leaving behind the poor cavegirl. It takes a ton of convincing before Spock finally gives in and out. You can literally taste the sadness in the end. Leaving the caveman alone in her frozen desert seems cruel and is really touching. Spock had to be out of his vulkin mind to leave behind his greatest hope of love and being human. Anyway, in a neighborhood not very nice! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you really get what you pay for with this episode .... A love story, Salem's witch trials, Spock as a human being, the desperation to be left in total isolation ... abandoned, and three entirely different parameters on the extraterrestrial planet. It's amazing, they managed to put everything in a film of fifty minutes. This one is a classic, do not miss it .... I want it on DVD, but it is very vulgar !!!!!!
