No other film has made me feel that before ... and I do not feel bad. For example, I do not want to get my money back or the time I've been waiting to watch this movie (9 months), and I do not feel bad about using two hours of a summer day sunny to watch this ______. The reason I say "_____" is that no matter how hard I twist my brain, I can not seem to find a word in ANY of the seven languages ​​in which the film was written to sum up. I have no idea what was going on all the time and in the middle of the movie, I needed a break. No movie has ever done that to me before. Never in my life have I wanted so much cauliflower, milk and chopsticks. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * erases the throat * No words. No thoughts. I do not know. I really do not know. - Cait
