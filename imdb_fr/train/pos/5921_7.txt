I was the accountant for the production of this film and I also had to do a dubbing job, so I'm not quite impartial, but if it was horrible, I would say it. I thought it was a fun movie, far from being a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible says that laughter is good as a medicine, so watching this movie could be good for your health. <br /> <br /> So many actors on this image had not reached their peak at the time of the creation of this film. Susan Sarandon, of course, has become a much bigger celebrity ever since. Melanie Mayron was seen on television every week as a photographer in the television drama series "Thirty-Something". Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, always haunting people's dreams. One of my favorite personal actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedy actor and a really kind and sincere person. We all had fun working on this show, and I think it's fun.
