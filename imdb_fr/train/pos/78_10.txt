Even though he has one of the standard "revenge price scenarios," this movie is my favorite among Vincent Price's works. Gallico has the quality that is lacking in so many horror film characters: sympathy. When you look at him, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him when he is going to take revenge, even if he scares you with his initial fury. As the film progresses, his character becomes tragic. He committed his murder, but he must now kill to cover up his crime. And again to cover that one. And again ... your belly slumps down from his soul as he descends into his spiral - as if you're watching a beloved brother turn into a balaclava. Even though the story of vengeance is old, the intrigues themselves are original. Gallico uses his tricks to kill more and more inventives. Too bad that it is not available for the house.
