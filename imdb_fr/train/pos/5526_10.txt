I love cinema, so what I'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply. I had greeted "Che, parts 1 and 2" without having seen the movie. Terrible I know. But I felt trapped by ... who? I do not really know it, but there was a negative word of mouth that spread like wildfire and, as smart as I can be, I fell into it. But, fortunately, I came across an Argentine director, Martin Donovan, a man I adore and admire. When I told him that I was not going to see him because I knew the movie was a failure, he looked at me as if he was ready to hit me on the face and Donovan is a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I immediately went to see both parties and "Che, parts 1 and 2" is the best film I saw in 2008. It is so pure that it will remind you of the work of some of the greatest masters of the past. Respect for one's audience is something we are no longer used to. I do not know if we have already been. Riveting, moving, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is simply extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can really perceive it. The humanity of man is overwhelming. So, thanks again to Martin Donovan for teaching me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this historic film. Do not make the mistake I was going to make. Go see it now on the big screen
