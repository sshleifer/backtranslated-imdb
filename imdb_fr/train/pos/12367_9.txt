Well, after a long wait after watching a few clips from Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I've been waiting for a long time to see this movie. The plot was simple, the beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moved into an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a scary movie, even if it's a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The role play is good, and there are some really disturbing passages, like the clumsy orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the cake eating an orgy and laughing. The end is a strange mixture of deformed people and cannibals. It's very strange, camping but in the end, I really believe in a good movie! One of my favorites of the 70s, even if it is not very original. It's far-fetched and extremely scary! Probably one of my favorites of all time. 9/10
