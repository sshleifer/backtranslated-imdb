this film is a masterpiece of the story of a young woman during the war and it really happens, not exactly like in the movie, but it's a beautiful story, I was impressed by this movie , the acting and the story where I like a lot movie because it's a true story it's Giff, I feel like I was there and I'm sorry for the rector that plays Maruschka Detmers because who wants to end life that way. I recommend everyone to see this movie, especially to the younger ones and learn something from this movie. This film allows you to compare the orange film soldier and other story lived during the Second World War.
