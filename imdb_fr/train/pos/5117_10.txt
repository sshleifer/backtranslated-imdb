Very few films have had an impact on American culture as Urban Cowboy did. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class of its own as one of those movies that when you switch channels at 3am, you just can not stand eyes ... my first three are Animal House and Walking Tall, but it's irrelevant. I remember Urban Cowboy at the movie theaters, honkytonks were open on every corner, men wore cowboy hats with their moccasins, and if you did not know how to do it, you're considered an idiot! Personally, I think it's a good movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who had a thunk. He is really credible too. The soundtrack is great. Too bad, Charlene Tilton, of the televised celebrity in Dallas, ruined the career of Johnny Lee because this guy was just great. The show thief here is Scott Glenn as a Redneck ex-con greaser cowboy. And I have nothing against the ex-deranged cowboys greaser semi-be one myself, but I have always envied what I feel to be the biggest power line of all time ... " at S * # t! "A bit like Clint" do my day ". And watch him slapping Sissy is the closest thing I'll see in my Julia Roberts fantasy, so ..... as I said, gorgeous. 9/10
