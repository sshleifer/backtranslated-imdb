When I saw this movie, I was surprised that it was just a TV movie. I think this film should have been in theaters. I have seen a lot of rape movies, but this one is remarkable. This film has a kind of realism that is rarely found in today's movies, let alone in TV movies. It tells a story that, in my opinion, is very realistic for many rape victims in today's small cities, and I found it very believable (which is hard to find in other films about rape). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were awesome in their roles. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who loves movies that have a hard reality. I enjoyed it very much.
