First of all, it's not supposed to be a brilliant and stimulating film as so many other critics do. the first criticism says that anyone who likes that knows nothing about horror cinema, apparently the opposite. If we remember the film, it's not really convincing, it's a low budget ipecac. But that's really all she was aiming for, that is, the viewers were shocked (and all the flaws in her visual were far less noticeable than in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave a high score to this one because he achieved his goal. Although it was not horribly horrible (in the sense of shock), it made me slightly sick and completely paranoid / pessimistic (I do not trust anyone for about a week because I did not want to wake up stuck and tortured)
