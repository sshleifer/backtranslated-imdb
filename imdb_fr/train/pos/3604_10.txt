I think it's a good movie. because you can see how Diana's life is at home. she has assaulted so much and she wants to prove that girls can also fight. I think she and Adrian were great actors. Because of this film, I am also a boxer. It really impressed me. the only negative part that I think. Is the end. because it's going between Diana and Adrian. But you do not see how it is at home. And I did not really like you not seeing how his father and brother are doing. but I think it was a good movie and I think I'll watch it a lot more :) I recommend it to everyone, even if you do not like boxing, you can see a lot more than boxing. I had a good time watching it.
