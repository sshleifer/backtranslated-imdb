With all that falling right now with MJ, I started listening to his music, watching a strange documentary here and there, watching The Wiz and watching Moonwalker again. Maybe I just want to get a glimpse of this guy who, in my opinion, was really cool in the eighties just to maybe decide if he's guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is both a biography and a feature film that I will remember going to see at the cinema when it was released. Some of his messages contain subtle messages about MJ's feelings about the press and the obvious message of the drug is bad, but it's a shame. <br /> <br /> Visually impressive, this is of course Michael Jackson, so unless you love MJ remotely anyway, you'll hate it and find it boring. Some may say that MJ is an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say he did it for the fans. Which is true if it's really nice of him. <br /> <br /> The movie starts when it only starts for about 20 minutes, excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as an all-powerful psychopath lord of the drug. Why he wants so bad MJ exceeds me. Because MJ heard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci's character said that he wanted people to know that he's the one who supplies drugs, etc., so I do not know, maybe he just hates MJ's music. <br /> <br /> A lot of cool stuff in this stuff, like MJ becoming a car and a robot and the entire Speed ​​Demon sequence. In addition, the director must have the patience of a saint to film the Bad children's sequence, because filmmakers generally hate to work with a child, let alone to interpret a complex scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is for people who like MJ at one level or another (what I think is most people). If not, then stay away. He's trying to get a message across, and ironically, MJ's best friend in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is really one of the most talented men to ever have honored this planet, but is he guilty? Well, with all the attention I've given on that ... hmmm, I do not know, because people can be different behind closed doors, I know that. He is an extremely kind but stupid guy or one of the sickliest liars. I hope he is not the last.
