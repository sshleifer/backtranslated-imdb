I chose this film from the summary of the plot and quotes from critics on the back of the box. I am not a big fan of foreign films and I did not know what to expect. I do not really care about subtitles either. But I really loved it! It has a simple and lovely quality that lets you feel good in your life. I found myself laughing a few times. I would recommend this photo to anyone, even to those who hate foreign films with subtitles. This one is worth it.
