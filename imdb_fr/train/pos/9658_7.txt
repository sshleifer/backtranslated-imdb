"Come Undone" seems to arouse many opinions among the contributors to this forum. Admittedly, it's a film that promises a vision of gay life, as most viewers want. In a way, he moves away from this promise to become an introspective vision of a young man's soul. The film has the means to stay with us even when it is finished. This is a character study showing how a young man is involved in a love affair with someone so different from the one who will ultimately leave Mathieu confused, hurt and depressed when things do not happen. as expected. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you may want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastien Lifshitz, the director of the film, told his story from Mathieu's point of view. Most viewers seem to be disoriented by the different epochs of the film, but there are allusions that are not obvious, as we can see, in retrospect. The story is told in flashbacks that could add to the way some people will see the movie. It's a story about the condemned love that Mathieu felt for Cedric and the ultimate collapse of their life together. <br /> <br /> First of all, Cédric, the handsome young man from the region, goes after Mathieu until he manages to convince him to love him. Mathieu also feels an attraction for Cédric. We realize how different the two young men are, Cédric explains to Mathieu's family that, according to him, school is not for him. Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cédric took him. It is Mathieu who reads in the guide wants to attract the attention of Cédric. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu addresses his mother, she wisely explains to him the importance of pursuing his career. It also indicates what future they would have together, which turns out to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson the hard way. He continues an uncertain life with Cedric and tries to commit suicide. We see him in the hospital talking to a psychiatrist who has treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The end may seem confusing to most viewers, but there is a moment in the film where Mathieu goes to work in a bar where he is seen washing glasses and looking intensely at Pierre, the young man who frequents the bar. This is why, when Mathieu goes in search of Pierre at home, it seems difficult to imagine. Yet we have seen the interest shown by Mathieu for Pierre. The last scene at the beach, where Pierre and Mathieu walk in the sand, suggests that everything will be better between them as they watch a boy seemingly lost, but realize that the father is nearby. <Br /> <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent movies. He is a difficult young man to understand at a simple level. Mathieu suffered a lot, first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and after losing Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who has already been seen in other important French films, is just as good as the shallow Cedric. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" will divide the opinions, the film deserves to be viewed because of the complexity and care Sébastien Lifshitz gives to the story.
