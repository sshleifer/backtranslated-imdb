This film probably had a budget of $ 750 and still managed to outperform Titanic. I rented this the day I crushed my mother's car, and it was the only thing that cheered me up! he must be tied with "Killer Bimbos's Assault". Things to look for are: 1. The shot in the Chinese girl's scene 2. The blonde with bleach in the sassoon shirt that never changes 3. The scream as Flinstone at the wheel 4. The shocking set worn by the redhead just before she gets killed (do not worry, I do not spoil any surprise, it's so predictable) 5. The guy who finds it necessary to scream. 6. The mental patient who manages to be crazy by convincing the eyes of a model. 7. The pursuit of an hour at the end involving the teacher and the priest. 8. The womman writes grafitti on the wall of the bathroom. 9. Last but not least, the wonderful special effects - especially the dagger that made ... a paradise help me ... to burst a sound. <br /> <br /> enjoy it! <br />
