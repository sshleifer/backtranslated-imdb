Wonderful film still dealing with the trials and tribulations of the 11th World War in England. This film is so good, it's the touch of the human element. This film is in line with British classics such as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As in the case of this film, we are witnessing the desperation of the inhabitants in times of war. <br /> <br /> The performances are remarkable here, especially from John Thaw, embittered, to whom is entrusted a child who was evacuated the attack of London. <br /> <br /> We will see soon why this child wets his bed. He comes from an insane mother who mistreated him. <br /> <br /> The old man attacks the child and brings happiness in his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and only looks for him to discover the tragedy. He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince him that the child is better with him than being in a boy's house. <br /> <br /> The photo is so good because it treats and strengthens loving relationships.
