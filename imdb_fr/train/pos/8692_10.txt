I loved watching that. I did not know it was part of a larger series. I was about 6 years old at the time, it was on television. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I was deeply fascinated by something clear that was in the stack of toys for the chair's bathtub. My parents recorded it during its first broadcast on NBC. The cassette even contained the old advertisement for Sanka coffee with a few others. I plan to come back home soon and I will try to record the tape on my computer so that those who wish can do so. If any of you wish to contact me, I think you can do it via the IMDb site, do not hesitate. I will keep you informed and will let you know when the show will be in digital format.
