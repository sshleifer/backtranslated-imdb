This film has big stars in their infancy: Ingor Stevens has never been so beautiful; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, in conflict over his piracy and wishing to remain neutral with the United States. Charlton Heston did a very good job as Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a little scalded. It's really a good movie for students to learn this part of our story, AND it shows that all happy ends do NOT include lovers who meet. will understand them better in the long run. I have watched it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
