Hamlet is by far my favorite among all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is a big actor. His portrait of this was just amazing. His monologues were breathtaking. As long as it was done, it is rare that a film holds my interest, but I was absorbed by this particular piece. I recommend it to all Shakespeare fans and those who are not. This has all the modern world is looking for in its films: murder, treason and deception. Do not hit Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches on the whole job. This leaves no stone unturned. When you finish the movie, you will feel like reading the piece yourself. Uh, how do you say "bravo".
