I like Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all time. However, I could not afford to buy a ticket for his concert at Tacoma Dome during the Back in the US tour. I was upset to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still the man and I will enjoy it for years to come. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I would like to hear from Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Paul is not dead either. <br /> <br /> The biggest concert DVD of all time. <br /> <br /> ** *** out of *****.
