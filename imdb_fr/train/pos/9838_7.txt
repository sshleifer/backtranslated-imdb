Born Again is a good episode of season 1. The little reincarnation, in my opinion, is cool. The more I look at it, the more I love it, and yet it will never go beyond the "Very good" level for me. Even if it is not very memorable, I will always remember it as the episode of reincarnation. Anyway, I will now say what is good and bad in this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh yes! <br /> <br /> This fish tank was fine. =] <br /> <br /> Thrown through a window. Very classy. x] <br /> <br /> Bad: Wife your best friend's wife !? O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> Why did the guy who died leaving his tangled scarf try to take his scarf instead? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Correct episode, not very memorable. 7/10
