It's hard to put your finger on it. Basically, I suppose it's a comedy about a rich and idle drunk man who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl, whom he wants to marry at the risk of being denied by his family. <br /> <br /> Fun moments, romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and his selfish character is endearing. Liza Minelli is a convincing nod as her fiery opponent draws her, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's extremely sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> It's horny but very entertaining with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for nearly 3 months to our local flea.
