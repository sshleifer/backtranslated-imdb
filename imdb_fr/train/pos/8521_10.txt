I absolutely loved this show. I watched it from the time it was first aired in the late '90s to the very last episode. In my opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare nowadays. Certainly a show you could watch with a friend or your children. Yes, things have changed a bit with Jo since the last time we saw it in books, but it's still convincing with great stories and good lessons. The actress who plays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a great job, as does the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series, we discover the developing romance between Jo and Nick, as well as the stories and daily lessons kids and students are learning. I recommend this show to anyone.
