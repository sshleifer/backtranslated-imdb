Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, espionage stories do not interest me particularly and I did not know her. Nick Nolte is one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was great, but the plot too. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more attention on the moral issue: reading his anti-Semitic comments on the radio with secret messages hidden to the Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the American Germans ) to the Jews or Hitler. Which one has the most weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is all the more important as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not open up even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to describe - but with the help of excellent actors and photography, this film succeeds. <br /> <br /> There are other aspects, such as humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (like the song White Christmas), which make it really different from the average American cinema. I recommend it to anyone who is bored of Hollywood spy movies.
