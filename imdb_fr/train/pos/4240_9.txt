The title of vault does not correspond to this sweet romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake do not have a lot of chemistry - but their characters are not supposed to do it. Both are extremely friendly and attractive. <br /> <br /> Secondary casting is a dream - with the exception of Sig Ruman's annoying fake Russian.
