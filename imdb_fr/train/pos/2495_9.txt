A strange, spiritual and wonderful representation of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall has written something funny, apprehensive and sometimes scary! Yes, do not be fooled by the playful melody and bubbly characters of 2point4's children; the show has a dark side, and can sometimes be quite scary. And that's what's so good about the show, it's not a simplistic sitcom in which each character is a 2D comic device (the case of My Family). Instead, the characters are completely rounded individuals that show the whole roller coaster of human emotions. Sometimes dark moments such as Bill is supposed to be haunted by a curse and Ben waking up in a strange village are two examples of the series taking a dark and surreal twist, which helps to add a little depth. Of course, the show is incredibly funny and guarantees you a smile. It's a shame that Eureka Video has stopped publishing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get you in-store episodes.
