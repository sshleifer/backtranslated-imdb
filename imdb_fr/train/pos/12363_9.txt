This 1986 Italian-French remake of the film of the same name from 1946 warms the heat early and does not let us take the air. The story tells the story of a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not keep his eyes on the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to the school. One day he follows her and her persistence bears fruit. There is only one problem: she is betrothed to a sketchy character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who may have committed a heinous crime and, if he repents, will probably be dropped with a pat on the wrist. In addition, the young woman is a bit "funny in the head", which is corroborated when we discover that she saw the father of the boy, a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is matched only by her prodigious sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, from the beginning, with nice tracks and a detmers bomb performance, who plays us like a yo-yo (as she does the boy), from stage to stage, with enough suspense to leave us guess until - and even after - the end. Available in R and X (!) Versions.
