Wow! it's a good movie! The acting was not good at all, but if you look at it for a moment, go back and look again, it's a genius! The man at the beginning of the film walks with his suitcase against three. WOW! I never expected it. Then he puts the coca in a suitcase and runs away. I bet smoking against three was one of his friends who sold the drug later. And the genius quotes: '' beautiful nuances, I need a pair '' '' theirs .. if you think you can take them .. '' .. just great! And the fighting is the best I've known for a long time. Look at the second guy he picks up after hitting the first man's head against the table. What is a hit! And in the middle of the film, a guy in a car shot once, then three guys fall, he's really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, so exciting that James Cahill walks 5 minutes down the stairs and shoots jason peters after his distraction has passed. Jason Peters falls and turns around while he is dead! I can not say with more words how great this movie is!
