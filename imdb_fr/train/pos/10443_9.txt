The admirably directed blend of juvenile romance and travelogue in Paris, directed by Richard Linklater, is one of the most inspiring romantic films of the '90s. Julie Delpy plays one of the most captivating shows of the decade as as a young Parisian who spends a day with Ethan Hawke, a stranger in the train. The dialogue (and there are tons) is sometimes sinuous and too precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers establishing a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection is full of wonderfully funny, touching and insightful moments.
