Fantastic documentary from 1924. This early 20th century geography of today's Iraq was powerful. Look at this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before taking his Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, the photographer, then created Cinerama, an idea that probably hatched by filming the remarkable landscapes of this film. Fans of Werner Herzog will find that this film is a treasure. Heartbreaking narratives of struggle, complemented by the land around them, have never been so obvious in terms of human capacity to bear. The fact that this was done at the time shows not only the will of the subjects, but also that of the filmmakers.
