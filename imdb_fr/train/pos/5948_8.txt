Some posters seem less grumpy because they are neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but they obviously do not claim it either. You'll be looking for a bigger fan of Rodgers and Hart than me, but Burke and Van Heusen were not really chopped liver, in addition to what they knew Der Bingle thoroughly and had prepared great songs - But beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, It's always you, the next day forever, etc., to fit his very personal style. Here, they arrive with another beautiful ballad - and unfairly neglected - the ballad, Once And For Always, plus some optimistic entries inspired by the philosophy in If You bump your toe on the moon and do nothing. The fragile plot should not be taken seriously. Why make Merlin a heavy man whereas in most, if not all, versions he is more of a friend / mentor of Arthur? So, if you wonder why Sir Lancelot, who has been sold to historians as the incarnation of chivalry's metamorphoses and righteousness in a bully schoolyard that you're not going to enjoy much of what is essentially a funny movie. All in all, he does what he proposes to do, entertain, so good luck.
