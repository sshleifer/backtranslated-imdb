All Dogs Go To Heaven is on a par with Watership Down for scary kids movies. Both were dark and rather sinister, but at the same time the most fascinating experience a child can live. It was one of my favorite movies when I was a child. I was in love with Charlie and, at the age of five or six, I admit, I had a crush on a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of Charlie and his partner, Itchy. The story begins when Charlie escapes from death row and goes to the nearest club to play poker. Of course, when I was a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation, but as I get older, I begin to wonder why this movie did not bother me. It covers pretty adult themes - gambling, murder, hell and jail, but in a world of Disney movie films, it's something every kid should watch once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a kind of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and hell scenes make me more afraid now than when I was little, but it delivers a poignant message that parents do not should not ignore!
