"Stanley and Iris" is a heart-warming film about two people who meet and help each other to overcome their life's problems. Stanley's life is difficult because he never learned to read or write. Iris is a widow and has two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Stanley. She decides to teach Stanley how to read at home during her free time. Over time, they become romantically involved. After learning to read, Stanley turns to a good job in Chicago, then returns to Iris and asks him to marry him. <br /> <br /> This is a very good film without nudity, violence or desecration, which is rare in today's movies. A good movie all around. <br /> <br />
