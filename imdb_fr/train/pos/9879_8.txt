Presenting Lily Mars may have provided Judy Garland with one of the easiest roles she had at MGM, as Lily Mars was undoubtedly a character she could identify with. A pretty talented girl for ten, she knows she has the talent to do it in the theater, no matter how disheartening the producer Van Heflin from her home town is. <br /> <br /> I really liked Judy in this movie. one like the girl determined to do it in the theater. Because it's Judy Garland and Judy Garland's talent, you know in the audience that she has the right content, even if it has to convince almost the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Judy and Heflin are both from the same little town, Heflin's father was the city doctor who gave him birth with Heflin, while he may have moved out and became a big producer on Broadway. Their respective mothers, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington, remained in contact. It's his dish of success, but Heflin is constantly jostling with steel kids, but never someone like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> The song Presenting Lily Mars for Garland did not generate any resounding success, even though she sings all her numbers. The best in the film is a rebirth of this chestnut from the Gaslight era, every little movement has its own meaning. Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist playing the housekeeper in a Broadway theater where the Heflin show is produced. Gilchrist was a star at the time of FloraDora Girls and Judy and she played the song brilliantly with Connie. This is the best scene in the film, Gilchrist encouraging Judy to persevere. The composer Karl Hoschna passed away a long time ago, but the lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive and I bet he liked what he heard. <br /> <br /> European music star Marta Eggerth is in The presentation of Lily Mars as star of the show which is at first puzzled, then angry and finally, which includes Garland and Heflin. She shot a few films with MGM, then returned to Europe to work more on the continent. I bet MGM did not really know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent, although Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano he did not like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin is doing well. patient producer who supports a lot with Garland and Eggerth. Heflin had just won his Oscar for Johnny Eager the year before and he and Garland did not seem to be an ideal screen team, but they are not bad together. <br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is a beautiful thing. showcase of Judy Garland's talents. And she did not have to share the screen in another movie behind the scenes with Mickey Rooney.
