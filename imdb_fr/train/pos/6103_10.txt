I saw the movie recently at the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very entertaining and is something I believe from all over the world, and Black America is ready to see. There is comedy, drama, the soundtrack is excellent. It's a good movie all around. The characters were well developed and the film had a wide variety of leading actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titans, paid in full), Brian J. White (Three 3, Mr. 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean). The film addresses many relevant topics in today's society in a short time, with class and grace. It's not just a story about life in the hospital, but it's a story about people and their personal journey to find out who they are or who they are going to be.
