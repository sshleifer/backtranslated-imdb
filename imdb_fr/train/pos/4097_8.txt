Youth, sexuality and the French countryside - one of the most unique films you will see. If you can see it, this is not an easy task, given the difficulty of finding copies (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) It is sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting and sometimes funny. A bit boring too in the middle, but overall, you can not call yourself a weird movie lover before you've seen this one at least once.
