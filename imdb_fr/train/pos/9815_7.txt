Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although he did not come out for years), it is worth seeing. De Niro's role is not huge, but amusing as one of the two friends who first tried to prevent another friend's marriage and then chased him to force him to get married. Any hardcore fan of De Niro will be thrilled with a performance from the beginning of the film, arguably the best actor of today.
