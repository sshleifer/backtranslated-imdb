It was an excellent movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There was so much to connect, so many beautiful images and compassion in things that were not said. I had a lot of fun and I ended up with a feeling of joyous exuberance, just as I am when I finish most of Tom Robbins' stories. Now, I have not read this Robbin book, so I do not understand how it was matched, but I can not imagine that this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. The film leaves a lot to define, which is the best part of any Tom Robbins novel, imagining the details. <br /> <br /> For all those who said it was the worst film of all time, I pity the little that remains of the dimmed light in your hearts. Far from the worst, this film was glorious. Long live the Whooping Crane.
