Master of the show Cecil B. De Mille heads west. Using three legends of the Old West as protagonists (they probably never met), Gary Cooper describes Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur performing a beautiful Calamity Jane. The story serves only De Mille to suspend wonderful sequences of action, like the great Indian attack. Scenes like this are extremely well executed. Western entertaining. Look for the very young Anthony Quinn who plays the role of a brave Indian who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn. This part had at least pointed it out in Hollywood.
