I watch the series again now that the DVD is out (yes!). It seems to me as fresh, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired. <br /> <br /> The main performances are captivating, the scenarios are superimposed. <br /> <br /> I will shake my head and present it with The Prisoner as a series that will win new fans and will always be watched in 2035. <br /> <br /> I was asked to write a little more line (it seems that IMDb is coded as a user as always unpleasant and persistent! Pithy and, basically, this is clearly not the IMDb method.) <br /> The submission writers IMDb, American Gothic, understand that simplicity is paramount. <br /> <br /> In 22 episodes, the series covers more character development than many series in seven seasons. In addition to this, he questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way that challenges the viewer to ask himself what he would choose and what he would think in a given situation. <br /> <br /> When the show first aired, I was still mourning for Twin Peaks and I thought it would be an inexpensive reversal. Personally, I'm starting to give this question a higher rating and I think it's going to be stronger over the years. Count on the fact that this is not more controversial!
