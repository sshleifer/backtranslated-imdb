This is very dated, but that's part of the charm with this 1933 film. You can say the same thing for most pre-code movies; they are simply different and generally in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was the short duration, the great role of Spencer Tracy and the beauty of the face and the sweetness of Loretta Young's character that allowed me to watch and enjoy this intricate but complex film. <br /> <br /> You'd be hard-pressed to find a prettier girl than "Trinna", played by 20-year-old Young, who was already ready for her 50th film! (She started playing in childhood, that's right, and the fact that they're shooting movies quickly in the past.) The camera, while blurred over most of the film, zoomed before on Loretta's face and eyes, hypnotized by her beauty. <br /> <br /> Incarnated by a crooked and cynical man, Tracy's "Bill" slowly turned into a loving man, thanks to Trinna. Spencer delivered his aftershocks with such naturalness that you barely knew he was playing. <br /> <br /> Although they have small roles, supporting actors Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell leave lasting impressions long after watching this. 75 minutes film. I am particularly fascinated by Connolly's role as pastor / father figure of the camp. <br /> <br /> The story is a little far-fetched, but hey, that's the movie. This story tells the story of two solitary victims of the Great Depression who are trying to survive in a "Hooverville" type camp. The story is very touching.
