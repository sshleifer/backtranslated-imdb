One of the best movies ever made! Why he only got a score of 7.6 is a mystery. This film is a window to the world of black experience in America. Should be mandatory for all whites and children over 10 years old. I recommend watching it with "The Long Walk Home" as an accompanying piece. If you think that the work of Whoopi Goldberg is about Homer and Eddie or Hollywood Squares, think again. Do not miss this movie, which should have won the Oscar. (And read the book too!)
