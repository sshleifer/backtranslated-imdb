It's been so many years that I do not see it, but I feel compelled to defend this jewel against those who criticize it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinions here. That's what humor does, I suppose. It's subjective. It charges either by your funny bone at 60,000 volts, or leaves you cold and you wonder why you gave it time. <br /> <br /> This show presents some of the best actors in British comics in an irreverent idiotic story and the result is hilarious. The dialogue and the visual comedy are beautifully delivered and the two main roles (Cleese and Lowe) are superb together. This has been done for them. <br /> <br /> I can not say more than begging you to find it and watch it. You will not be disappointed and in a world devoid of refined humor, it is a classic and harmless piece of comic brilliance.
