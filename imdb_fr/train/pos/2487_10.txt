I must say that for Hamlet from the perspective of the students, his version of Brannagh is by far the best. His dedication to staying true to the original text should be applauded. This allows the piece to come to life on the screen and facilitates the task of reading and analyzing the text by the people who hold the text while watching, as we studied while studying it. <br /> <br /> We often hear criticizing the cast of big Hollywood names. I find that it helps viewers to recognize characters more easily, as opposed to similar-looking and sounding actors, which contributes to the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> In addition, his flashbacks help to clarify many ambiguities in the text. How far the relations between Hamlet and Ophelia go and why Fortinbras was at the castle at the end. Overall, this version contains not only some brilliant performances of both familiar and unknown Shakespeare actors. It is presented in such a way that it is not necessarily a doctorate in English literature to understand and appreciate it.
