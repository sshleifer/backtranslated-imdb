Well now, it was definitely a surprise episode. In this anthology of sci-fi series, with all these extraterrestrial beings, extraordinary events and many twists with the afterlife, this episode would certainly be unusual. Its seemingly insignificant parameters apparently do not seem to give morale to the end of the story. Or does it? Kick-off with silent movie form, no recorded dialogue, but with musical accompaniment. In this case, he is on the sound track, not using the organ or piano play of a musician at sight. This part of the episode, as well as the final section, was also liberally used for title cards, as was "The Old Time Movies". Although these titles are a bit exaggerated and exaggerated, they were created deliberately and with more affection for the film Silent Film than for the least they despise. <br /> <br /> Norman Z. McLeod, director of the comedy wheelchair comedy for this half hour payment. He has been the director of several of the greatest comedies of all time, featuring characters such as Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kaye. He was no stranger to television because he had worked a lot on the television series. <br /> <br /> It does not look like he and Mr. Keaton have ever worked together (I can not find any proof of that), but judging by the results of the film, they managed to do it easily! All of Keaton's directors knew that Buster was also a good director and a comedian. He was as comfortable behind the camera as in front of him. Their short partnership had to be harmonious, with mutual concessions on how to do things. It is obvious that many gags were those of Keaton, resurrected from his own Silent Picture Days. For example, Keaton and Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle of Roscoe in one of the Arbuckle 2 mills, THE GARAGE (1919) helped put on the panties at Rollo (Stanley Adams). In a nutshell, <br /> <br /> Buster knew we were filming our world with a camera, giving it a two-dimensional image. This fact is at the bottom of so many gags. This is a cardinal rule for his film making. <br /> <br /> The cast was small and once again we have just been showered with the talent of veterans. Stanley Adams was Rollo and served as Mr. Keaton's right-hand player. Jesse White, the old man "repairman Maytag" Gil Lamb, a serene veteran of the RKO Short Comedy series, was the 1890s cop, James Flavin, George E. Stone, Harry Fleer, Warren Parker and Milton Parsons. largely silent casting. <br /> <br /> Without spilling the beans, let's just say yes, there is probably a lesson here. If it's not already the one before mentioned: "The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence!", So how about: "Pay attention to what you ask, because that you can get it! "
