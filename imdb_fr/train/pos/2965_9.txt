Most likely one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you know it, I suggest you see "South Park", one of the funniest cartoons created. Buy it, you'll laugh every time you see it. A pure stroke of genius. If you do not find it funny, you have neither soul nor sense of humor. 10 of 10.
