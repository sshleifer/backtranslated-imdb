Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is Batman's latest animated movie to be released in video / DVD format. The plot revolves around a new crime fighter, the Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in blocking a large shipment of weapons. <br /> <br /> Although the film is quite interesting, it is not as good as "Phantasm Mask", "Sub-Zero" or "Return of the Joker". The main reason is that it does not release the emotional appeal of other films. At the end of this film, we are really not sorry for anyone like everyone else, especially "Sub-Zero". No other tragedy has made the other animated films special for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (as was Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly "stiff" and boring that the viewer does not really care what happened to her that led her to put on the mask or what happens to her end and this is where lies the main reason we do not receive this special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I found the movie enjoyable. There are moments such as, when the audience discovers who is really Batwoman and that returns an old villain who was seen for the last time in the original movie "Batman: The Animated Series". The action is also very pleasant with moments of suspense. <br /> <br /> If the background of the Batwoman was more interesting, this film would have been better than "The Return of the Joker" in my book, but in its current version, it is in 4th (out of 4 ). <br /> <br /> When it comes to animation, it's the same as the cartoon from The New Batman Adventures from the mid-to-late 1990s. The score is not as memorable as the three previous animated Batman movies, but it still remains good. <br /> <br /> I recommend the purchase of this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is nice. But remember, it's not as good as other Batman animation movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
