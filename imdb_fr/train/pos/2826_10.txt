I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a beautifully restored theater that was once part of Paramount's extensive vaudeville chain of homes. This Paramount has a "powerful Wurlitzer organ" ?? also beautifully restored - used to accompany the silent movies of the day. <br /> <br /> We were fortunate to have Dennis James, a key figure in the international renaissance of silent films at Mighty Wurlitzer. music and thematic compositions in line with the action of the film. The print was an almost perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the whole experience was a unique opportunity to see a silent film as it was supposed to be seen. <br /> <br /> This was Greta Garbo's first American film. She was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat ironic that it is a silent film about an opera star; Even though the Mighty Wurlitzer added a lot to the staging, we had to leave a lot to the imagination. <br /> <br /> The modern audience, for the most part, does not understand silent movies ?? To act was then different, with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. So the audience laughs at inappropriate times? the acting is seen as "hammy" and too much ?? but it was simply the style of the period. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all her subtlety, did a lot to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes also read in a look down or a simple shrug. She embodies the truism that "a picture is worth a thousand words". <br /> <br /> Even though this is Garbo's first American film, it's obvious that the studio knew what they had in their hands: it was MGM's filming at its best. The sets and costumes were beautiful. Special effects ?? which compared to current standards are quite low ?? were always electrifying and amazing. <br /> <br /> The scenario of Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) seems to be tailor-made for Garbo; it highlights its assets, magnifies its assets and poses no embarrassing linguistic problems: a Swedish actress can interpret a Spanish temptress without suspension of disbelief on our part. <br /> <br /> His co-star was MGM's Reply to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and has done something that few romantic stars of the day would have done in a film: to allow oneself to be banal, to appear stupid and to grow old without grace. <br /> <br /> There are pretty good parts of the character who are more than well acted ?? especially when we consider the power plant that was Garbo. Among them are Lucien Littlefield (Cupido) and Martha Mattox (Do√±a Bernarda Brull). <br /> <br /> The extraordinary director of photography, William H. Daniels, met Garbo ?? they then made 20 films together. (He was the director of photography for 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) He was able to capture his ethereal beauty and it is his photography that is primarily responsible for the nickname that has earned him becoming known: The Divine Garbo. Without her wonderful abilities, she would not have had the success she had been. <br /> <br /> Seeing this film is an opportunity far too rare: do not miss this opportunity.
