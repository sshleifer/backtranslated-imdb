An excellent cast makes this movie work; all the characters are extremely well developed and it is clear that the actors liked to film this film. <br /> <br /> This is not quite the comedy I was expecting, but rather a slight look at the attempt to reclaim the glory of youth as stupid humor. . For music fans, there are many subtle references that in themselves are cleverly funny. <br /> <br /> I hate making direct comparisons with other movies, but this film reminded me so much of Alan Parker's films that I can not help him: imagine if The Commitments really did - and then tried to reclaim the glory said 25 years later.
