Whenever I hear a movie touted because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, etc., my b.s. the detector turns off. Usually, a film like this is a sentimental hog that is for people who want nothing to surprise them, but to say how much they are superior to us madmen. So, when David Lynch's STRAIGHT STORY started to get that kind of criticism, I was worried, especially since I was not a fan of his other uplifting story, THE ELEPHANT MAN. Despite all the breathtaking images and good acting in this film, he seemed more interested in preaching than in inspiration. <br /> <br /> I did not need to worry. THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest film rather than saccharine. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and the writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney say the thing directly and simply. There are some homilies at Straight without which I could not have done without, and the grain harvesting plans are a little too much repeated, but they are only small pleasures. There is no message in the heavy hand, no sentimental string to shake our emotions and no condescension to us and his characters. Instead, they depend on history to create their own power, and this is the case. Therefore, we are truly moved by the final scene. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth's cast adds realism to the play. He is really someone who seems to have lived many things but who persists and, with the exception of these homilies, his desire to find his brother does not seem excessively sentimental, because you can feel here that someone has lived so long and seen too much to be driven by anger for a long time. And since he knows his time is running out, he wants to make peace, not only with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek is also doing a good job as a Straight girl. And while I'm a city dweller and a suburban citizen, the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin are beautifully made, which at least makes me want to go back one day or the other.
