It's a comedy as it used to be, and comparing it to the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE ON AGAIN ?, just highlights how filmmakers of the '40s had a flair for comedy that unfortunately been lost since. <br /> <br /> I was 15 years old when I saw this for the first time and even at that tender age, there were a lot of things that made me laugh. Of course, now familiar with the frustrations of adults, I see many things that I missed in my youth. <br /> <br /> The three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... have perfectly dialogued, but the heart of the film lies in the frustrations encountered in the realization of a dream. It's never as easy and free from invisible complications as you imagine. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a classic comedy that remains above the attempt to redo it.
