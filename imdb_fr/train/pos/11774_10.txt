Is it a good idea to use live animals for shop windows? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why .... <br /> <br /> In "Packed Hare", the sale of Bugs is the promotion is over and the manager of the store (Nelson) transfers it in a new service: taxidermy. Naturally, Bugs objects and fun begin. <br /> <br /> using almost every shelf of the store (children's wear, sports, shoes, suits, women's nightgown - do not ask for it.), Bugs comes first at every turn, even referring to the manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE". Even if he's stuck in an elevator, Bugs makes the most of the situation. <br /> <br /> The director Jones is always at the top of his pictorial game, just like Blanc (like Bugs, natch) and Nelson (the director - who sounds like the mainstay of the radio Gildersleeves - will ask your big ones -parents). <br /> <br /> And sensible advice: when you are confronted with a blurry woman who wants to try bathroom slippers, always check her ears. <br /> <br /> Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", the best argument at the moment for animal work legislation.
