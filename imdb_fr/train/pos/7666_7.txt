Two wizards fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) trying to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) trying to save her. "Dr. Mordrid" is a fantastic and fantastic price that offers a lot cheese.The plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent, but the movie is very short and fun.So, if you have enough time to kill give to that At a glance.My rating: 7 out of 10
