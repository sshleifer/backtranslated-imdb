There should be more movies about our Native Americans. I especially think that using real Native Americans would be the right thing. I know that this Archie Belaney, played by Pierce Brosnan, did a great job in describing this character, since he was English. But my suggestion in Hollywood is to put more American Indians in the roles and never use anyone else. The Sioux nation has been put on the back burner for too long. Their poverty is a shame for our country. I firmly believe that our country should send the Black Hills back to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return their lands to the Arabs, but we make no effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
