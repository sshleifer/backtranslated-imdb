I do not know what movie some people watched, but they must have seen a "Joseph Smith: the prophet of recovery" different from the one I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the film was both well done and inspiring. I think it's really worth watching. It is obvious from the beginning that this film was made with great care. The backdrops are beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film does a good job in describing Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie.
