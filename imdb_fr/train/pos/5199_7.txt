It's not only a great African-American classic comedy, but one of the many great American cult classics. I recently bought the Rudy Ray Moore Collector's Edition. If you like old karate movies and black comedies, this is for you! They do not make movies like that anymore. All my family is a film buff, so this site is an extreme help for the resolution of many debates. I am deployed in Iraq right now. It helps me stay connected to the world I know in the United States.
