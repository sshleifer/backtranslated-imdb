I remember this game. It was always sitting alone on the shelves, until the day I decided to try something new to change, and I had this game. I watched it with admiration, because it was the first game of my PS1 to have four discs. When I played it, I could not ask the controller, seriously. <br /> <br /> The scenario of this game is so good and twisted that it is almost as good as the scenario of Final Fantasy VII, and it is difficult to accomplish. When you play the game, you get so involved with the characters, it's amazing that it's just a PS1 game, because it feels like a movie. And I think that should be the subject of a movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad that this game is a new game and that no one has ever played or loved, because it is one of those games that remains seated. the ends of the shelves, with a 50% discount sign sitting on it, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those who always watch the ends and try them out and most of them are really good. Heck, that's how I discovered Final Fantasy VII, looking in a catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon, is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, surprisingly. I would not be surprised if it was made by Square Enix, but it is not. Virtually every game I play is better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is. But what really bothers me is why he is very little known and not praised, what he should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from him? It's a PS1 man, made in 1999. The story I mentioned before is incredible, almost superior to VII. The characters are great, you get involved a lot with them and with their actions. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, without a doubt. He deserved much more praise and a RPG done very well by a company other than Square Enix. .
