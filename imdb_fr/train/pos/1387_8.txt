A little slow (a bit like a film by Sofia Coppola) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories to what it looked like. The confusion and insecurities are described in a very simple way but so true to reality. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. The camera works wonderfully too. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back at this time of our lives when we discover our sexual urges and desires. I would also say that it's a good movie for young people going through this period. Many films have been filmed on adolescence, but this represents the very essence of the adult world's discovery of romance and its complexities.
