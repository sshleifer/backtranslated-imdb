Diagnosis The murder was broadcast almost every afternoon of the week on BBC1 since I watched it sick 10 years ago when I was sick of school. I know I should not really appreciate it, just as I should not appreciate it. "But I'm totally addicted to both and I even have the DVD boxes ... OK, I know it's sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke presents the series in the lead role of Dr. Mark Sloan Physician at the Los Angeles Community General Hospital, police consultant for the Los Angeles Police. - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - the son of Dick's real life) is a police officer who needs his father's help for many suspicious deaths. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), community resident resident pathologist, accompanies the group. During the first two seasons, Scott Baio played Dr. Jack Stewart, who then left the series. in 1995 in the hope of moving on to bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, he has not done anything remarkable since .... and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Oh Dear !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dr.Jack Stewart was replaced by the young Dr.Jesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter, who took Baio's shoes very well. <br /> <br /> The series is highly implausible, but which Whodunit series is not? (The murder she wrote - wherever Jessica surrenders, someone eventually dies, or the under-rated Father Dowling Mysteries on a priest solving the murder with a nun's acolyte) <br /> <br /> The series was much lighter until 1997 because it had a support group including hospital director Norman Briggs, played by Michael Tucci, accompanied by Dolores, nurse secretary and Dolores, by Delores Hall. After 1997, these two characters were no longer included and the series became a more serious affair with a larger budget, some episodes included much more action. One episode, the whole hospital was destroyed. <br /> <br /> It was a family broadcast. For the Van Dykes, because in addition to Dick's son, Barry, you also had Dick's daughter and all her grandchildren. an appearance in various episodes. <br /> <br /> As the show progressed, it became a bit silly, an episode I remember, Dick van Dike plays his whole family, which was a little out of the ordinary, but in the 'together, the' diagnostic diagnosis' really good TV show that has had many good stars. <br /> <br /> Since the end of this show in 2001, Dick and Barry have once again appeared together in TV Movies' "MURDER 101" series produced by The Hallmark Channel, many following the same path, and always pleasant. Dick, who is now about 80 years old, does not seem to be changing much and seems to be working to the end. <br /> <br /> TV show **** SUR *** **
