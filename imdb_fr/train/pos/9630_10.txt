I've seen Dirty Work many times and it's probably my favorite Stan and Ollie. <br /> <br /> In this one, Stan and Ollie are doing the sweeping and get the job of cleaning the fireplace at Professor Noodle's (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle makes crazy experiments in his laboratory, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos when trying to clean the fireplace and disrupt the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a special formula tank that Noodle uses for his experiments and that turns him into a chimpanzee! The best part is when Ollie falls in the fireplace and tons of bricks land on his head, but he does not seem to suffer much. <br /> <br /> Dirty Work, it's Stan and Ollie at the funniest. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
