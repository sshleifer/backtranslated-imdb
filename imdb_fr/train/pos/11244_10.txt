One of my best movies of all time, maybe because I knew the punk scene in the late '70s and I played in many hazel shows, but the movie was a good story and a very good game actor from hazel and Phil Daniels, a promising player to come. sure of his latest Eastenders project !! excellent performance of many unknown actors who, if you keep your eyes open, will see them in many British soap operas today exp: Carver out of the bill, the more I look at it, the more I spot it, well, if you do not have not seen it Do not forget to remove the safety pin for nose and make-up for heavy butter eyes and shave your head in Mochanian's style ... Enjoy
