In the lineage of G-Men, The House on 92nd Street, The Unnamed Street, The FBI Story, is now one of those carefully supervised movies that presented the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best light possible. Even though director J. Edgar Hoover was alive for 48 years, it would not be presented in any other light. <br /> <br /> Don Whitehead's book on which this film is based is a straightforward story of the office since its founding in 1907 until about the time The FBI Story was released. It is sometimes important to remember that there was an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover led it. Part of this time is also covered in the film. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary, which gives the FBI the fictitious character of John 'Chip' Hardesty. James Stewart is an FBI career man who graduated in law and who, instead of working, was hired in the office in the early 20s. <br /> <br /> In real life, the office was led by William J Private Investigator Agency Burns of the Burns. It was in fact a grossly political operation, as the film shows. Burns was on the periphery of the Harding Administration scandals. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to incorporate professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence, he did so. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family who is Stewart and his wife Vera Miles, we see the story of the FBI unfold. In addition, we see much of their personal family history that is completely embedded in the history of the FBI. Stewart and Miles are definitely an all-American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases in which Stewart is involved, arresting members of the Ku Klux Klan, a plot to assassinate oil-rich Indians, shooting down the notorious criminals of the 1930s, their involvement in the arrest of Nazi sympathizers during the Second World War and against the communists. espionage during the Cold War. <br /> <br /> There is some kind of prologue in which Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before delving into the story of the office mingling with his. This involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who had bought a lot of life insurance from his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you goosebumps as an author and the story is sadly relevant today. <br /> <br /> Of course, if The FBI Story was written and produced today, it would reflect something different and not quite American. The FBI nevertheless has a story to tell, which is by no means negative. <br /> <br /> The FBI's story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films, but it's the first movie I've seen with my favorite movie. actor in it so he has a particular penchant for me. If all the FBI consisted of Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel much better about it. There is also a good performance by Murray Hamilton, his friend and teammate killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles did not just marry Stewart, she actually married the FBI under the same name. the movie shows. It's mostly dated, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.
