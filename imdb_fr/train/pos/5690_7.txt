I just watched this movie on DVD and think that the acting was very good, but the story left a lot to be desired. This film has the same texture and look as Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that human beings can live this type of life; on the belly of society, in which their total existence is based on illicit drug use, crime, violence, sex and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or anything, including themselves . <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is remarkable in his role as John Holmes, former porn star "exhausted". The distribution is just as good. However, it is a dark, disturbing and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the daily lives of these people were equally brutal. Unless you are interested in these murders or if you are a "fan" of John Holmes, it's really not a movie to see. If you want to see a docu-drama about the murder, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood (1960), starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake, is much better.
