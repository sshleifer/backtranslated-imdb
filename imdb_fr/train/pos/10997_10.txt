SENSATIONAL. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen, ever seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely LOVED! Before the opening credits, I was stuck on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a Sci-Fi thriller - AND the edge of your Whodunnit seat. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I wish this never ends. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a role to throw. Everyone could have played it. The lead actor, Jeremy Northram, was the perfect geek. <br /> <br /> This film appeals to all lovers of war games, sneakers and trackers. <br /> <br /> Amazing! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06. Walt D in LV
