Besides the fact that, in all its splendor, this film has exceeded all my expectations, this masterpiece of film history describes the abuse of shit filters in its best! Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a fraternal conflict with everything there is to do. As usual, a woman concealing her true intentions. The end was as surprising as the assassination of Keith Scott by his elder brother. <br /> <br /> The scenes in "the walking earth" are faithful to what I remember from my first trips. - To be honest, my great passion for trashy movies makes it a must in my never-ending collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all lovers of the biggest One Tree Hill brothers cast. <br /> <br /> -Odin-
