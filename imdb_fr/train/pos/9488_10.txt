Extremely memorable, intelligent and moving film of one of the true geniuses of French cinema, the formidable talented Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel of the assassination of JFK and takes place in a fictional and unspecified country. The film, both visually and intriguingly, is extremely clear. Shot with meticulous precision, he follows Henry Volnay, the Prosecutor who is in charge of unraveling the coup. In many ways, it's a very disturbing film, especially for the cold and analytical precision of his commentary on the inner workings of a so-called modern state. The atmosphere and characters are all very credible, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in his plot. On another level, this relatively unknown film is just 15 years ahead of Oliver Stone, who has been acclaimed for the film "JFK", a film of inferior quality in many areas, the least of which is not his credibility ... It's a masterpiece, any movie lover should see it, preferably in its original French version with subtitles.
