The revolutionary musical of Ren√© Clair. If you want to see where the songs have led a story for the first time, this is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who discovers he has won the lottery just when his creditors call him. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in the apartment of his girlfriend and was given to a fugitive convict who then ... oh but it would be revealing. <br /> <br /> This is light and sparkling story where much of the dialogue is sung (most people think it did not happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's the kind of movie they do not do anymore, and rarely when they do it. His sound is an early film that plays like a movie five or six years later. Clair moves his camera in a way that even Busby Berkeley did not (although to be honest, comparing the two filmmakers is unfair since Berkeley was essentially doing scene-related dance numbers and Clair was putting the camera in "the real world"). It's an amazing little movie. and it's a charming film that will make you smile. It's just a piece of mellow pleasure. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I can not say more. It's just a good little movie and it's really all you need to know.
