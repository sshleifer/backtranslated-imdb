In 2006, AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative wildlife documentaries in the coldest place on the planet. This film was March of the Penguins, told by Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades. They embarked on making live action movies and this was a coincidence. Disney then created a sub-division called Disneynature and released his first feature called Earth. It's absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Told by the great James Earl Jones, Earth offers nothing new to anyone who has been watching the Discovery Channel for the last five years or closely following the global warming crisis. The Earth is very deeply concerned with the issue and adopts a very liberal approach in this area. <br /> <br /> It allows an emotional connection with nature that I have never known before. It also shows not only the beauty and mystification of some parts of our beautiful planet, but also the grumbling and disturbing aspects it often entails. It's one thing to watch "Mufasa" fall off a cliff in a rush or if Bambi's mother gets shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods. That's good because at the end of the film, we know it's just a movie. It shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all kinds of families, from all walks of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. These real things make a real cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Although the graphic nature of the film is a bit heavy (which many people will disapprove of), the Earth is a touching experience. A team of brilliant photographers and a superb performance by George Fenton perform amazing film work. Compared with March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, he does not take any action, but he is excellent in himself. At the end of the day, you develop an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness because many of us will probably never have the chance to visit these places we will talk about in the film. We live here but it's like we never had to explore the planet for one reason or another. The Earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
