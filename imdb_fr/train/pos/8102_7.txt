Things to Come is a historical film. With Metropolis (1927), it is one of the first major science fiction shows. It's also one of the first apocalyptic movies. It is remarkable to see how filmmakers predict the beginning of the Second World War in a year and even, in a subtle way, the year that would end in the real world. But the film departs from reality and describes a world devastated by war (nuclear weapons must be replaced only by a toxic gas, which did not exist in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half-hour of the film is an incredible sight, making revolutionary use of models and matte paintings - later become staples of the science fiction genre. It is unfortunate that after the coming events, science fiction is identified with cheap B-series films, a stereotype that would not have been broken before 2001: a space odyssey of over 30 years later. If they had been content with the quality of the effects in this film, things would have been very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play several roles in this film, for the best effect. Massey plays a big role as "Doctor Who" as a pilot of an advanced civilization (for 1970) trying to win the people of a devastated country ruled by a single warlord (Ralph Richardson's highly effective performance). In the end, the scenario covers 100 years. But it's a big problem with this movie - there is not really a coherent scenario. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in such an episodic film - a little reminiscent of intolerance, in fact - it's hard to have a conventional plot, but I thought we could have done it more, and although the visuals of the last third of the photo are really breathtaking and worth the price of the admission ticket ... the plot is non-existent and the film itself suddenly ends as is. become interesting. Perhaps the producers were thinking of another science fiction innovation: a sequel? <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a movie that any serious science-fiction fan should see at least once. Unlike Metropolis, however, it may not support repeated viewing.
