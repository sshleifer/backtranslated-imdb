I had the pleasure of attending a screening of The Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This film caught my attention some time ago when I came across an article about it in Jalouse magazine. Sounded interesting at the time, but nothing exciting. Anyway, I saw it at the festival program and I decided to check. All I can say is that I was speechless when the end credits began to roll. It's one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I've seen in a while. Photography, art direction, acting and especially staging were flawless and impeccable. Nothing is "explained" for you in this film and really makes you think. Something that a large majority of movies do today is exactly the opposite. The dialogue is carefully designed and, although this script is not a chat, the words of the characters are very thoughtful and meaningful. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of those movies that deserves a second reading and more you see. that, the more you notice. It is a very stratified and intelligent film. I do not know when or where it will play again, but a must see for moviegoers.
