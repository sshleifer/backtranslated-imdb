Jeremy Northam's description of Morgan Sullivan, the rocking book and its gentle manners, and to watch him leave pieces of his true identity under the influence of single malt scotch and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and is a pleasure to watch. Offering him a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, made without thinking or even asking and he gets lost in his face, neck and lips. No matter the brainwashing, love has a way to persevere. Nor can love be "brainwashed" with either one of her two false wives. In gradual steps, he begins to do without his glasses, to walk and talk differently and even his face is different as the film progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and sometimes well conducted. The intensive use of black and white and gray tones makes it a sci-fi "film noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would have liked to see more vulnerability in the representation of Lucy Liu, every time she sees him in his various troubled states, the man she loves and for whom she performs a mission based on a blind faith, a vulnerability limited and flashes of sincere sympathy and worry would have made a performance less a dimension on his part. It does not weigh in the face of Northam's talents, but on the whole, I really liked this film and would like to know other scripts written by the same author.
