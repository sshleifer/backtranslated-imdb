I saw this movie last night on the cable and it's amazing. What I like most is that he is sober and discreet, but deeply sincere. The performance of Henry Thomas (he played the child in E.T.) is masterfully inarticulate (he is supposed to be a man of few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (given that we are talking about a Hollywood product here), a baby is the main character, but does not act and has no lines, but rather simply IS (and is bright to that). It is interesting to note that the mysterious relationship of Thomas w. E.T. was the core of this film; while its link w. the baby is at the heart of "A good baby." <br /> <br /> Then there is music - ah, what music! The tunes of Gillian Welch are wonderful and the whole score is a beautiful mountain music. <br /> <br /> This film is wonderfully atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
