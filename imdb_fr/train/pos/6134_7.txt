Some DVDs own me until I have to buy it. It was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing him as a child and I loved him. I never knew there were scenes and music numbers that were cut, so I was intrigued to see what they could be. I agree that the "Portabellow Road" sequence is now a bit long (just like the football match), but other than that, I was not afraid of the other scenes that were repositioned to their respectful place. Maybe Disney should have had the original version (which IS the restored version) on one side and the restored version on the other side, users could then choose what they wanted to see. Overall, it's still an entertaining film that manages to rediscover some of my childhood memories.
