* What I like about SPOILERS * Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes), a teenager, is going to live with her older sister, Valerie (Jennie Garth), not to move to Japan with her father. but she does not know half of the wacky things that will happen to her now, and not just for her, but for her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), her boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend, Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), his annoying colleague, Lauren (Leslie Grossman), and his second, Peter (?) . Do not have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you only like sophisticated comedy, it's not for you; if you like a funny, sometimes touching show, with two hot girls who can play the main role (and nothing less than the fabulous "Mary Cherry" of Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what that you are waiting? ? You are welcome at Casa De Tyler! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
