I thought it was a very charming film. The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong did well in the lead, but the best performances came from his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and Patty Hearst. I think the commentators are far from the base on this one. They seem to take for Pecker the worst value of his work as a gospel, while I think the film pretty clearly indicates that he is really a promising artist.
