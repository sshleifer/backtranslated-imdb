This is my first comment! It's a fantastic movie! I watched everything one night on television. At first, I thought it was a B movie, but then I realized it was an amazing product. <br /> <br /> I suggested to friends to see the movie, to tell me it was bad. B movie. That's wrong. Superficial criticism <br /> <br /> I think the film is almost a product of genius! The famous director has done a great job here and it is a shame to say he was out of the game all this time.
