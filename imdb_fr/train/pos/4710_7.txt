As far as parody films are concerned, few are worth the time and energy. but with a recent resurgence of ugly parodies like Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a really funny joke like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no end of medical problems, little Johnny will work for the crowd. What follows is a series of gags, most of which work, but there are occasional flops. But a foreign gangster who can not master the American language (at least blasphemy, at least), a rival gangster leaning for having shot his mouth (... once!), A younger brother with the DA who is at the looking for Johhny Dangerously, and a hot young star for her affection, has Johnny busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be busy laughing, most of the time, because every shot of gangster film is broken by a talented cast and a decent writing. <br /> <br /> Not perfect for a long shot, but really good for a smile on a bad day.
