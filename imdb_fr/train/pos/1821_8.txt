When I was a little girl (and my dad owned a video store), that was part of my favorite movies. I had not heard much about it since and I really did not remember it, it had been forgotten after the other films of Don Bluth, probably better. However, I managed to find him a few weeks ago and I was again pleasantly surprised. Located in New Orleans in the 1930s, the entertainment is delicious and the songs memorable. There are some blunders in continuity if you look hard enough, but they usually do not interfere with the scenario, which leaves you smiling (and maybe even a little embarrassed, if you're an animal lover). The characters are believable (maybe even a bit too big for younger viewers), too. Two feet up, and for those of you who have not seen it in a while, it's definitely worth seeing again.
