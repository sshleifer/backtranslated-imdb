I also saw it when it was released in 1956 and have been hit since its final scene. If this is an answer to "High noon", it is a relevant and relevant answer. The idea that, as this channel says, "The city is coming together", is a message much stronger than the solitary personal heroism of "High Noon". In this theme, "Concho" is a phenomenal forerunner of one of my favorite favorites, "The Magnificent Seven". Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from a bullying brother to a liberating savior of the city. I only hope that at some point, all the friends and family to whom I have been affectionately attached to this film over the years will have the opportunity to live it for themselves.
