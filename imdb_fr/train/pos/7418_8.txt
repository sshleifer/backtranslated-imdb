"Shower" is a story of loyalty, unstoppable advances in the modern world to the detriment of more traditional and more human lifestyles. A man forced to choose between his brilliant career in the business world, his life in the big cities, his wife and his younger brother delayed. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we should do. Modern China against the old. Public baths with rallies, cricket battles against malls and skyscrapers. Many old men and women who are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, moving, full of fun and bitter-sweet amusements. The most sensitive will cry and laugh too. The actors are enormous, especially the one who plays the role of the retarded boy; and Yang Zhang is doing a good job, easy, simple, letting the story unfold on its own. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
