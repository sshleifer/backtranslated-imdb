I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hiphop movies I've seen as Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars, etc. Whenever I ask other people what is their favorite, it seems that BEAT STREET comes out the most. But still, it is the lowest ranked of all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (if, say, 5 points is the belt). I love the musical performances, the breakdance makes me want to shoot, RAMO makes me want to start a piece ... c'mon, it's a classic!
