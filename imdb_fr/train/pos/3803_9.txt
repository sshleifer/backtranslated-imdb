What people do not understand about this film is that it's not a beginning, a middle and an end, it's just the conclusion of a 26 episode television series. So remember when you all talk about how the world has not been sufficiently explored. That's all that was done on the television show. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the visual effects are, I think the *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo towards the end of the movie was what really made me love this movie. Seeing characters I'd been following for 26 episodes was arguing like that, it was scary, and seeing Gwizdo wander sadly alone among the floating ruins as Lian-Chu sharpened his blade was almost heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Then we had a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these incredibly unbelievable dragons (who had already been featured in the series) while Gwizdo babbled insensibly and indirectly threatened to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene was not mentioned more often in warnings. Any sensual child will be able to see that Gwizdo was not himself and was intent on strangling this little girl. That was enough to annoy me and I was 15 years old. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than most blockbuster movies of millions of copies, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go. Check it out. :)
