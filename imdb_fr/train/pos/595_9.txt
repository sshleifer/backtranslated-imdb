When John Wayne filmed his Alamo story, he built a complete Alamo set in the city of Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and is a real tourist attraction. As long as it lasts, we will have a set of future interpretations of Alamo for the screen. Such a thing with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was made during this century. <br /> <br /> But I would say that Alamo: Thirteen days to glory is the best Alamo story filmed to date. John Wayne's film is a good movie if it's oversized, but it's a John Wayne movie whose story has been redone to fill John Wayne's character settings on screen. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a nice interpretation of the pioneering character he was before. <br /> <br /> It's much closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book on The Alamo than Wayne's after reading the book years ago I can attest to that. Tinkle's book is cited as a source in both films, but Tinkle was still alive when Wayne's film was shot and he was not happy with the result. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was almost the right age for young William Barrett Travis, the idealistic fighter for freedom who was also a slave owner. At the time, nobody saw the ironic contradiction in all this. One thing that has not been explored and has not been explored is Travis's hyperactive sexual drive. He was the Casanova of the Southwest, he even kept a diary of his libidinal conquests. <br /> <br /> But the man who still has whitewash is Jim Bowie, played here by James Arness. True, he was a hero at Alamo, but his career before Alamo was that of a scoundrel. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, a scammer who sold land for which he held a dubious title. But his heroic death has certainly redeemed him. No trace of this is in the Arness representation, nor any other I've seen from Bowie on the screen. And of course, he designed the Bowie knife, according to his specifications. This man needed such a weapon. <br /> <br /> However, the main asset of Alamo: Thirteen days to glory is a full representation of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, President of Mexico, who personally presents himself to calm the rebellion caused by North Americans came to Texas at the invitation of Mexico. Unfortunately, these Americans came with preconceived ideas about freedom that had not traveled as far south, at least for whites. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna, who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also a little villainous, but he was the best product in Mexico until the arrival of a real reformer, Benito Juarez. <br /> <br /> This film was the farewell performance of Lorne Greene, who briefly appears as General Sam Houston. Greene did not quite fit my Houston design, he was really too old for the role. Houston was in his forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of Texas. But within the limits that are imposed on him, Greene does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> For a romantic narrative of the Alamo tale, see the John Wayne version, but I highly recommend this film for its historical content.
