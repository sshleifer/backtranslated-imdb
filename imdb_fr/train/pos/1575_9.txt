Van Trotta Rosenstrasse is the best film I've seen in years. In fact, I'm not really interested in films with historical background, but with that, it caught my interest for that time! <br /> <br /> the only boring thing about this movie was I had "tried to be as American as possible" ... which, in my opinion, absolutely failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the back really touched my heart. German actress Katja Riemann won the prize. she is one of the most impressive actresses I have ever seen. in the future, I will watch more of his films. good luck for me to be my mother tongue German =) and only for a year in the United States, so as soon as I get back, I will buy Riemann DVDs. <br /> <br /> who has not seen this movie yet: WATCH IT !!! I think it would be too long to describe what it is, although all the backsliding and changes of time are difficult to explain, but simply watcxh, you will be zested !!!!!!!
