From the first shots of the main actor, we see very early how so many women are managed by their women and the humor that emerges from everything that happens in everyday life in a "normal" life. . <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, the director, explains how many Europeans feel totally in control of their lives. Yet without the help / support of the women around them, nothing seems to be able to move things forward. . The use of the facial image throughout the film is superb, and its clever positioning of the oldest member of the family (the mother) is perfect. <br /> <br /> Even if there are enough laughs in the film, deals with single parents / adoption and the strength of the family in society. Really rewarding to watch, and again only French couture is able to do. <br /> <br /> So far, one of the 50 best films I've seen this year, which deserves a five-player rating. I look forward to adding this one to the DVD collection when it comes out and highly recommend it to all ages.
