"Hundstage" is seidl's first feature film (before that, he made great documentaries as "animal love" or "models"). seidl has worked on this project for over 3 years, but it costs only about $ 2 million. the actors are very good, especially the non-professional actors who have almost played themselves. Cinematography is good too. the whole movie is shocking, disturbing and some scenes may be too much for "ordinary" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are alone and unable to communicate with each other. Finally, I must say that it is one of the best and most rewarding Austrian films of recent years. please excuse my bad english. <br /> <br />
