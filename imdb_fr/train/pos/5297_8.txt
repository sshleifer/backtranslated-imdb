I went to see this film with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was crowded and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines. I knew it sounded good, but it was a lot funnier than I thought. I liked Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they seemed really strange, just like normal people, if it makes sense. I'm tired of movies that show that teenagers are like cookie cutters, like "jock", "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to understand each other. I will recommend this film to all my friends and I will look forward to seeing it on DVD. Go see it with your friends who can laugh at the funniest moments of life! I intend to see him again at the theater and I will not see things more than once very often.
