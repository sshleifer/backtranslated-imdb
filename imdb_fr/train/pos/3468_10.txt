I absolutely loved this movie! I hesitated at first to look at it because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how difficult it was when John was shot. However, watching the "Two of us" brought me back to a happier time when he was still alive and where there was hope and opportunity. I think the writer did a remarkable job in describing what "could have been". Aidan Quinn was adorable like Paul and took up the challenge head-on. I was impressed by his accent and his manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite credible as John. My favorite parts were the stage in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, which I consider appropriate in the circumstances.
