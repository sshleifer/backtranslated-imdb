I do not think it was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. It was a simple plot, but interesting. It's a good movie to watch when you do not want to think, but you just want to tell a story. The Canadian landscape was breathtaking. The beautiful shots of autumn have made the image worthy of being seen.
