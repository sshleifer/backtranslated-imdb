I grew up in southern West Virginia; I'm about the same age as Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys", which forms the basis of this heart-warming film. The story of this film is warm to the heart. <br /> I am therefore closely linked to the subject of coal mining in West Virginia and the striking effect that Sputnik had on us (October 4, 1957) on us all. The Rocket Boys then made beautiful lives. I then got my degrees in physics and computer engineering. All because Sputnik has awakened many young people to the "scientific gap" that the United States had over the United States during the Cold War era ... <br /> <br /> It's a movie wonderful for all, at any age. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late '50s, your heart will be touched. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Understand it; Look at this; Recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
