It was only during my second viewing, years later, that I realized two things about this film: 1) I enjoyed it immensely, and 2) because its execution is much more accurate than does not justify the principle. I laughed at the beginning of the film before renewing my initial protests - passwords and slogans and head in the air (even a good head up) are just not funny, especially when they are shot at background. But although the film's momentum begins to choke towards the end, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene) display a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout the more clumsy jokes (For example, Ted does not recognize a certain inhabitant of hell) works as easily as the wildest (eg, the challenge). And the combination of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the rapprochement of Bill and Ted (who only spend a scene in the film, disaster if they are not alike) appears without any constraint. <br /> <br /> (Note: I found that the first movie was only sporadically entertaining - there seems to be different comedic sensibilities, it seems.) <br /> <br /> I gives him a score of 7.75. Amazingly good fun.
