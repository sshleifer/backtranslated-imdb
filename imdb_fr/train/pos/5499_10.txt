I had no idea what happened in this movie. Remembering this situation, I accepted the information presented at the time in the media: a confusion around a questionable personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if something of this caliber has already been done. I assumed that the protagonist was Mr. Chavez, but everyone who climbed on an image was important and in the end, the reality of this enthusiasm: the people, was overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
