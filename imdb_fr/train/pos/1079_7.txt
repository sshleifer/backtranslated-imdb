Although this has not been seen before in many movies, you have certainly seen the basic themes of the plot in too many movies since. <br /> <br /> Neither of Grant and Loy's best films, they make a remarkable effort together. After all, with so much talent and very good actors, you know that laughter will be there. <br /> <br /> The film is light, it has dramatic traces but keeps the plot moving and makes you smile. <br /> <br /> An excellent example of a classic American film fare that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Final price of Saturday afternoon, heavy in popcorn.
