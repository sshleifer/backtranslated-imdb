The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered it all these years because I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just shook me. I was on vacation with my aunts at Fort. It's worth it, Texas and I'll never forget it. Today, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get me a copy of this document that I can see as an adult. It took a lot of research to find out which film it was, but I always remembered Barbara Stanwyck and finally got the name and the reviews. I liked it a lot, but it scared me! Jaqui
