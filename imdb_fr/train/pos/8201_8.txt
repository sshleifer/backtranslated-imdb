Suddenly Impact tends to be treated as an artistic failure of Eastwood at a point in his career when he had earned a good reputation as a director. The reason is not actually the film itself but the attitude it adopts towards the vigilantism that it seems to support. In some places, he actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry movie. One could argue that if it does - in the end, it's a film about guilt, justice and punishment. For me, at the end of the day, it's more empathy than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments, we easily forget that the sudden impact is a terribly well done film. Forget the "Go punk, make my scene of the day" is iconic but not original. But look at the views of San Francisco taken from the air, zooming in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are pretty spectacular. You can also watch the brilliantly created scene where Sondra Locke's character visits his sister with mental illness at the hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces. In short, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood had shown it on screen, even though it was in an actionable film with questionable ideology. Plus, I think it's Eastwood's first well-timed movie. Although Eastwood has a tremendous talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been its weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). The narrative space allows the visual elements to fit well into the movie and not distract from the story. The only thing that is really boring is the farting dog.
