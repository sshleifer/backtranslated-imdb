It's not the same as other dance movies. Some normal people found themselves after dancing. Unlike Hollywood dance movies, the characters in this movie are neither beautiful nor hot. It's someone you can see every day in your office. They are depressed by their lives and finally find themselves with their dream of dancing. It touches me very deeply.
