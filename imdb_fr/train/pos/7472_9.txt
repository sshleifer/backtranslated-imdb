I really liked this movie. I read some of the other reviews and, although I pity those who did not understand it, I share some of the criticisms. Which, strangely, makes me even more like this movie. I admit that they have a nice distribution to make a smart movie for the general public, yet it has so many levels and is still nice to watch. I also like movies, like this one, that spark so much debate, theories, possible denouements and hidden texts. Congratulations Mr. Crowe, certainly in my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> PS I saw him when he came out for the first time while traveling to Mexico, it was late at night and I had to go back to my hotel and I made a big paranoia trip ! Where does the dream end and where does the real begin?
