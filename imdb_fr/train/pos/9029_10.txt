I saw this movie a few days ago. This film is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad, you've always dreamed of it - you can have it. This shows that happiness, sadness, despair and failure come true. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can change things and be happy.
