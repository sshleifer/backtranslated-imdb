Personally, I do not like rap, but I still found hilarious the fear of a black hat. I'm sure I did not have some jokes inside, but some that I knew, and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of Spinal Tap, so naturally, I had to check that. It was derived from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this movie was still an original, intelligent and funny satire. My favorite: "At the time of the slaves, they did not have a hat to protect themselves from the sun, so at the end of the day, they were too tired to revolt, now we have some."
