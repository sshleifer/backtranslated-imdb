Eytan Fox did it again: to move the viewer into a modest story unfolding in an overwhelming mess. The film also manages to describe in such a perfect and subtle way the atmosphere of the amazing city of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and everything is there: the lifestyle, the relations, the beating city heart, the disorder, the shock of the utopian mentalities in the lightest megalopolis, the lightest and most unconscious of all time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: It is a journey for the heart and the mind, with an interesting perspective to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note Bene: There is a central gay plot in the movie. If you do not think you are too gay-friendly, get ready to be challenged and consider it a "just love". (and do not worry: the chick is hot too!)
