In simple terms, Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It's filled with memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name a few - and equally memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens classic novel and very much like the story of Oliver Twist, it is a perfect family film. There are scary moments - the nasty Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is pretty scary all by himself - but overall, the movie will appeal to kids of all ages, as well as adults. <br /> <br /> The story - which almost everyone is surely familiar now - revolves around a little orphan named Oliver and his life grew up in London. At first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his orphaned companions, but after daring to question Mr. Bumble, the supervisor, he is sold to a family as a servant. <br /> <br /> After a series of incidents and a close shave, he meets the Artful Dodger - superbly interpreted by the young Jack Wild, who plays the main role - and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains young boys to choose treasures he keeps for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was only shot in studios and on the sound stage of Shepperton Film Studios, but that does not translate at all by film. The sets perfectly reproduce Victorian London, as well as the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a huge success on his way out, Oliver! is a worthy candidate for the best musical of all time and will delight all those who love the cinema.
