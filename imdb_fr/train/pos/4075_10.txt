Laputa: the castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as his new works and pirates purer, fantastic and flying, how could he be better! The art is totally incredible and the soundtrack, which is reused several times after that (I do not know if it was the first time I heard it), arouses in me the most emotional emotional response of any soundtrack of movie. Sheeta, the main female role in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, Pazu, is also a great model - he lives alone! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I will not give it, but the end is really great. I classify this as one of Miyazaki's top three with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. Also, you might want to check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (hopefully next year), if you like Miyazaki, check out this one because it's available in the United States. Enjoy, Piper A
