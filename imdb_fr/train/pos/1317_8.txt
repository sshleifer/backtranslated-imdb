This anime was underrated and still is. As I said, just the dorky kids movie, I always come back to those 10 years after seeing it for the first time. One of the best films released. <br /> <br /> The animation is not perfect, it's good, the camera turns give it a 3D impression and the story is still as successful today even after I grew up and that I have seen revolutionary projects like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It is obvious that there is no depth near the depth, but try to see it from an unobstructed view. It's a story to entertain, not to question. <br /> <br /> One more of my favorites, I'll be back when I feel like a laugh about lighter animes. Not to say it's a childish film, there are some surprisingly sad moments and you need a sense of humor to see everything.
