It was an extremely good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as a tortured genius, Luzhin, and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affections such as his strange dances. Emily Watson fits very well in her supporting role as a sensitive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and near-madness is well explored by Gorris and Nabokov's familiar preoccupations such as "eternal innocence" ("Lolita") are evident in this film. I think I will now continue to read the novel. It was a touching and tragic end and it was hard to keep your eyes dry. Shiny film!
