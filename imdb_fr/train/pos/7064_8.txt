Deanna Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and allowed him to stay a big studio. By the mid-1930s, most of Universal's top executives, such as Milestone, Browning, and Wyler, had left. Only James Whale remained, but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short film "Every Sunday" and initially, Garland was suggested for the role of Penny in "Three Smart Girls". When Garland was unavailable, Universal moved to Durbin. At first she was definitely a supportive player, but her potential was so strong that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster, the film had a European touch. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a magnificent panorama of a lake in "Switzerland". The "three smart girls" of the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) sail with Penny giving her glorious voice to "My Heart is Singing". Everything is going badly at home: their father plans to remarry with a younger woman (Binnie Barnes). The three girls, helped by their faithful nurse (Lucille Watson), decide to go to New York to reunite him with their mother. . Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's severe mother in "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger who, along with her fat mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For a person without cinematic experience, Deanna is wonderful as Penny, a typical embarrassing, annoying and overly enthusiastic sister, and she is as pretty as an image. When she sings "Someone to take care of me" for her father, you'll just melt - what glorious voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines of the movie. When her father comforted her with "I'll take you to the zoo tomorrow," she says, "Oh, I see enough monkeys around here!" <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire a "count" (Mischa Auer) to romance Donna. They organize themselves to end up in a nightclub, but because of a confusion, Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is mistaken for the account and Donna falls in love with him (she thinks he owns half from Australia !!!). Kay and Donna want to hasten her marriage with Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take things in hand and runs away. She is taken to the local police station where she seduces the police with her interpretation of "Il Bacio" (she tries to convince them that she is a young opera singer). Everything ends well with their mother (Nella Walker) who goes to the patch with their father and in the meantime, Donna meets the fake account (Mischa Auer) and goes to Australia with him. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
