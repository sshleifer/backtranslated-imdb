Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie. There were some remarkable blunders, but we can expect it in a film like this that was shot in such a short time. I did not feel any desire to move quickly during the movie and I found it quite entertaining. It sometimes becomes silly, but overall, I recommend it. They probably used all the glitters at nearby stores and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
