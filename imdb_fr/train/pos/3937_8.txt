The beginning of Abe Lincoln's career is beautifully presented by Ford. No one has ever seen images of true Lincoln, but Fonda, wearing a fake nose, is as strange as Lincoln, with his voice, performance, gait, and other ways - just as one might imagine. Ford, in the first of his three consecutive films made with Fonda, is in top shape, evoking perfectly America early in the 19th century. The story focuses on a couple accused of murder that Lincoln defends and the audience scenes are rather well prepared. The support cast includes many regulars from Ford. It was Alice Brady's latest film because she died months after she was released.
