I give ten out of ten, it's one of the best movies of all time. Absolutely broken, stunned and stunned by the situation as a whole, the wonderful game of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and all the crew, an incredible plot ... Just look into yourself and bend your courage to admit it . That touched your soul, because it's strange, but there are all the answers you've always wanted ... The best, mr. Ritchie! The best best ever. Those who were looking for simple figurations and skirmishes kept shouting that they were disappointed. But there are a lot of shallow movies in Hollywood today, you can not remember what it was the next day. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could hardly have hoped that it would be possible to paint such a clear and brilliant portrait of myself, of all those who had to look at it. Absolutely unmatched, amazing, dazzling ... You can get a glimpse by looking at this, I have no doubt. In fact, no word can express my admiration ... I still wonder how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of hilarious nonsense in Hollywood. Thank you with all my heart, it's simply the best.
