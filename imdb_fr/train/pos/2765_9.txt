It is the French and the Belgians who do what they do best. It's an original tale, visually inventive, exhilarating and emotionally stimulating. The director Jaco van Dormael takes us to the world of Georges, a victim of Down syndrome and in his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone, anyone. This is not condescending but with a great sense of fun and honesty. George's interaction with the corporate management guru, Harry, is dazzlingly manipulated - from comedy to tragedy and back to comedy with breathtaking ease. <br /> <br /> The Eighth Day features Hollywood cuisine similar to that of Barry Levinson, Rain Man or Robert The Forrest Gump from Zemeckis is well and truly in the shade. Sometimes, it evokes the humor of the Flight over a cuckoo's nest of Milos Forman, with the nuances of Dennis Potter on display. <br /> <br /> While the yuppie moved and desperately lonely, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns again a sublime performance. But he is accompanied by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne in the role of Georges. It's a film with consistently strong performances and so, many memorable backgrounds - the shoe store scene, the car show scene, George's dance on Genesis's "Jesus He Knows Me", the the conference, the fireworks scene. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing to do. Rent it or watch a screening in a retro cinema near you to see what's missing. Better yet, buy this movie. Pure genius .....
