I praised this film a lot. I praised it hoping that something would not be so bad for an evening. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be in a film that is not intended to be a stupid comedy but full of meaning and moral values. It manages on both levels. All roles are good but especially those who play, play too I have never seen any of these actors before, but they were nice and made me aware of what happens to them at the end, which says a lot . The scenario is smart, engaging and refreshing. . I think you will not be disappointed to watch this.
