I only know another film that could compete with Opening Night and that is Bergman's Persona. Both films are simply incredible, they have a wealth of ideas difficult to grasp at first sight. We have a deep meditation on the relationship between art and life. An actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), is more in touch with the character she plays on stage than she would like. The accidental death of one of his fans, a girl who declares his love for Myrtle and who is then overturned by a car, leaves a deep mark in the actress. She begins to ask questions about her aging that begin to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much and Myrtle is just a step away from total madness. The scene where she kills the imaginary (or not) mind of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes I've found in a Cassavets movie. The film ends with a show of genius from the director who is filming a theater scene where he and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene, since Myrtle is too drunk in the evening of the first night to play her role accurately. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is authentic, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely incredible. If you liked Persona or if you are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas and quality entertainment, this movie will fit you perfectly.
