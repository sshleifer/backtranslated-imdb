This film is very underrated. It's very imaginative, creative and intelligent. It's just fun and in my opinion, this movie is the first. But the film was forgotten at the time of its release and has become even more neglected over the years. Bill & Ted's "Bogus Journey" was also bombed at the box office, while the first one was a very good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> I think maybe the problem is that this movie just came out a few years too late. In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed "so 80". Although the 80s were at the time, the landscape of music and children's style had changed dramatically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and Seattle sound. Bill and Ted with their music of Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses with their 80's style seemed so out of place and out of date in 91, and I think that's one of the BIG reasons why the movie was bombed at the box office. Nobody except surfers always said things like "excellent!" and "fake!" in 1991. "Gremlins 2", which also came out in the early 90s, suffered the same fate as a good film bombarded at the box office because it was too associated with the 80s. The transition from the 80s to The 1990s was a much faster change than today with the 90's and 00's. 1991 was nothing more than 1988 or 1989, while at present, 2002 and 2001 still look like 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> If only "Excellent Adventure" that was made in 1988, was released THIS YEAR instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was created quickly and published in 1989, then it would probably been received as savagely as the first.
