I resisted the screening of this film and I understand why it was not a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" feels and seems so familiar. And it's. All the plots and emotions of the plot have already been explored in other movies - and maybe even better. But despite its familiarity and resistance to all Hollywood formulas, this film is a winner and friendly at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration of this journey of heart, mind and soul. While characters from Steven Sondheim's musical, MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood gaping at the top of their apartment, hoping their new generation would be launched rocket boys of that real tale. Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as the best way out of life in the mines. <br /> <br /> The masterful direction and the casting are reminiscent of the rocket boy Homer and his friends. fresh and new. Secondary intrigues concerning the troubled young teacher of Homer are particularly affected. Remarkable restraint is shown in the description of their delicate relationship. The father / son supblot who anchors the film is also remarkable. Perfectly played all around. Even Homer's mother gets her moment without cliche or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and breathtaking. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> A big chain of videos that I despise has a sign next to this movie stating that you will love this movie or that it will pay you back. For once, I agree with them. You will never look at the same October sky again. <br /> <br />
