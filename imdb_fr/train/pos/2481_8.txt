I admit that I saw only three plays by Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth and, of course, Hamlet) one of those I loved, the other I found (Macbeth) and Hamlet that I came to find a masterpiece. I'm happy to tell you that this adaptation is just as good as the intense and dramatic game. The acting is extremely strong (with a cast starring Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you lose?) And the change of period (looks like somewhere between the 17th and the 1800s) is set to wonder when the characters move and say their infamous lines directly from the script itself that any fan of the Shakespearean game will get chills. If you like this popular drama, I urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation of Shakespearean admirer Kenneth Branagh.
