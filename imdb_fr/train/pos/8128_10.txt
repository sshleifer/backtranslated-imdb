I first saw this as a child living in East London. The scars of the Hitlerite Luftwaffe were all too obvious and the landscape of the film was reminiscent of our street. I remember having nightmares after seeing him. The strange thing is, it has not really dated so far as considered a part of social history in film fiction. <br /> <br /> Aside from a destructive world war, the size of the machines was very bad, more nanotechnology now, but overall, an excellent and well-designed job. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived at the time. I would think that shooting with a spaceship with a gigantic cannon would almost certainly kill astronauts. However, many were right. Mans desire of war, inhuman man for man. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
