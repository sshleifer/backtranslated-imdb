I liked Dedee Pfeiffer (is it well written?) In Cybil. I have not seen her for a while and I forgot how much she missed me. I thought she had done a great job in this area. The support cast was very good too. From certain angles, the girl looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was rather scary and the story usually had good twists. The young boyfriend was a hottie. I thought the husband certainly had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> I just received the Lifetime lifetime film network for Christmas and I love these movies. Have kept my interest and I will watch it again when they restart it. Can anyone else recommend movies similar to this one? You can post on the forum or send me a private email if you wish. Thank you in advance. About.
