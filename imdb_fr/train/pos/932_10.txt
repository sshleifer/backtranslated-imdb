********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe it's a TV movie. Just the phrase "makes TV" makes me shudder. The production values ​​of films made for television are almost always remarkably inferior to those of professional film studios. That being said, this version of "Christmas Carol" should have been shown in theaters because it is so good. This is my favorite among all the Christmas Carol movies because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor problems on the screen with two of the ghosts that visit Scrooge, but there is no existing movie that does not present at least some errors. <br /> <br /> Scott presents a stellar performance like Scrooge, it's a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can not think of a performance in this film that should not be applauded. The costumes, the outdoor shot and the winter backdrop are fascinating. The musical score is endearing and comforting. Add to that a solid achievement, a flawless cinematography and a faithful scenario. here we have what will one day be considered a classic holiday. It's not really long since I'm a classic, but notice my words, someday, it will be soon. This film has become a Christmas tradition every year at home because it embodies the true meaning of Christmas: love, selflessness and gifts. In a world so selfish and greedy, my family and I can get lost in "The Christmas Carol", with George C. Scott.
