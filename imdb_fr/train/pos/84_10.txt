I used this film in a religion class that I taught. The golden fish swim happily in his bowl in an apartment on the top floor. A young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy received money to buy milk. On the way back, he stops at the carnival to play a game. Next to him is a man in a black suit who looks a little scary. The boy drops the bottle of milk. It breaks. The man in black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what is happening at home. A black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He (?) Sees the fishbowl and looks at it. The fish swims energetically and gets out of the bowl. Right now, a group of teenagers in my class and I have fallen in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in his mouth and we hold our breath. The cat drops the fish in the bowl. The double story includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudices. Both are innocent. It was an excellent topic of discussion in my class.
