This is an excellent little movie about the loneliness of the single. Phillipe Harel as Our Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single but does not know how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he really does not make any effort! <br /> <br /> He has a stoicism and fatalism that defy any hope of ever reaching the couple. - his friend Jos√© Garcia, Tisserand, is in the same situation, but makes at least a brave effort to transcend his long virginity (he is 28 years old and admits that he has never had sex). <br /> <br /> Very good exterior shots of Paris and Rouen, where the two computer scientists travel for business. They try various night clubs and places but all in vain. My theory is that they are trying in the wrong place - they go to more or less "young" clubs; they should try the guy who has older people, over their own age. <br /> <br /> Harel gets more and more isolated and makes a little Niro effort, as in Taxi Driver, urging his friend / colleague to stab some guy who shot a pretty girl into the nightclub. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
