In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luj√°n) lives with his asthmatic wife, Lola (Marisa Paredes), in an old house. Lola is still complaining about the death of their son Augustin some time ago. The colonel is waiting for his combatant pension in a war against a Catholic church for nearly twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old fight. Without having neither possession nor money, but a valuable pledge, they struggle to survive while waiting for the government's letter of acknowledgment, recognizing the law and paying the delayed pension. This slow moving film reflects the social and financial situation of most retired seniors in Third World countries. In Brazil, most retirees are expected to survive on about $ 80,000 a month. The colonel's debts in history were made to pay a graveyard for his son, otherwise he would be buried as a pauper. Exceptional casting performance, in a very sad story that is the reality in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): ("Do not write to the colonel") (do not write to colonel) <br /> <br />
