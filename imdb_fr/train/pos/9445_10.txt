This is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. The first time I saw him, I was about 9 or 10 years old. I started looking before the rape scene. And when I saw it, I was really shocked to think "what a little sick movie is this?" Today, I see it from the beginning and I really understand how great this movie is. It's exciting, scary, shocking and disturbing in its own way. But the best thing about this is the end where the public is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. This will torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lives of the bodies found in this river. And they can not do anything about it, they have to live with it. This ending is one of the most unfortunate endings in film history and it is very intelligent, brilliant and horrible. <br /> <br /> And the acting is also excellent, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. Wonderful play in this movie. Overall, John Boorman created one of the best movies in his history based on Dick Chaney's novel. A must for all moviegoers
