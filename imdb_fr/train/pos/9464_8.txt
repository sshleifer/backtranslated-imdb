When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie gets a phone call and leaves Dan, first giving her her phone number. Dan immediately falls in love with Marie, but when he returns home, he discovers that Mary is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. During the weekend, the lure between the awkward Dan and Mary increases and they must make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise and a charming movie, with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the magnificent Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is impressive and it is very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments in this story.
