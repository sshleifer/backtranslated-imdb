After all the bullshit of Hollywood (and India), we finally get a movie that delivers scary moments. There are some clich√©s, but I'm not sure that it's possible today to make an entirely original film. There is not much new here ... it's just right. <br /> <br /> Be sure to be careful because "subtle" alerts happen quickly and often. This is not a movie to watch while you eat a pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a red herring very well written in this film and, unfortunately, a very badly interpreted role. Cheri Christian does not make an effective Julie (wife / mother). On the one hand, she is totally unfriendly. I know, I know ... she just had a traumatic experience. But the viewer never knows her as she does "normally" and the relationship between her and her husband is rather annoying (unintentionally). I think the director wanted us to have sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a helping hand for the end, which is both disturbing and satisfying. This could easily have been mitigated with a sound effect at the beginning of the ending credits, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece by any means, but it's a good old horror movie game ... something that's pretty rare nowadays.
