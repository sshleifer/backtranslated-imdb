It's really a big unknown movie. A perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s. This film was based on the talent of the actor and he was ripped off. There was even a little comedy, but it was not exaggerated. Once in life This is what is supposed to be a crime drama. It's not the special case that affects sex. I particularly liked the interracial aspects of this story. <br /> <br /> Now, these are the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was superb for playing a small career criminal. It's a shame that he is allowed to show his talent only in his own film. Titus Welliver was fabulous as a junky half-brother to Fishburne. Eamonn Walker has added flavor to the already perfectly spiced movie. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat monkey and lord of drugs. I loved his acting role since "King of New York". But the best acting in this film was directed by Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly paired as two Calderon henchmen. <br /> <br /> Once in life is definitely a guardian. **** 1/2 * on *****.
