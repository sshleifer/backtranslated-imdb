The brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) do not fight only for Debra Winger's affections but for a secret of their childhood that left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surrealist touches (firefighters acting like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to the way American Werewolf in London uses all the great Wolf songs they can get ~ but with the fire ~ and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) . ~ "She is a lady" ~ invaluable;) <br /> <br /> The best missing line in the quotes section btw ~ "Once you've had a clown, you never come back!" <br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered the DVD in the US) and if the comments written by the kind of people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3 did not discourage you, try -the :)
