It is an amazing movie of 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the elegant vision of the year 2036 that follows catches up. However, do not plan to be able to understand the whole dialogue - sound quality and accents (it's American - but American "from the 1930s) make it difficult. <br /> <br /> Basically, the The story is a 100-year look at a fictitious American city called "Everytown." This goes from 1936, when a war looms on the horizon, to 2036, when technology advances and creates its own problems. > <br /> The first hour is a little slow - although it's hard to say what audience at the time would have thought, events, suspense and visuals are rather unobtrusive in the current situation. When it happens in the future, it's just fun to watch.The big sets and the retro-science-fiction look of everything are hard to beat. <br /> <br /> Unless you have great abilities this movie is difficult to listen to, I think I only understood 80% of he could use subtitling. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of science fiction, this is one of the classics of the genre and you have to see it (at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait for the subtitled version, then watch it if you're comfortable with movies from that period.
