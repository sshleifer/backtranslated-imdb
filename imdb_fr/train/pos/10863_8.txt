First of all, I must say that I made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence. I say unfortunately, because after seeing election 2 first, the election seems a little disappointing. Both films are gangster epics with similar forms. And although the election is a nice film, it is not as good as the sequel. <br /> <br /> The first installment of the election shows the two contestants in the presidency; Big D and Lok. After a few scenes of "uncle" discussions about who should have the title of president, they decide (almost unanimously) that That Lok (Simon Yam) will lead the Triads. Suffice to say that it does not go well with his competitor Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and in order to influence the takeover, Big D removes two of his uncles to tip the election committee on his side. This has disastrous results and leads the triads into an all-out war. Lok is determined to become president but will not become official until he is able to recover the "dragon head stick", a physical representation of the president's power. The current president, Whistle (Chung Wang) has hidden the witness somewhere in mainland China and the race is open to find out who can pick him up first. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the witness. . All aspiring leaders looking for the flop, they must avoid the cops and their opponents, which leads to one of the most notable scenes of Election, which involves an underlying named Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete and many bad guys. The presence of Nick Cheung is disturbing to say the least ... I wonder if this influential director Johhnie To, in any way whatsoever, during the second election, while he delivers more character Jet later. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung gives a stage flight performance, I must not fail to give due to the rest of the film actors. Election has a large distribution with well thought out performances, both subtle and percussive. Simon Yam is his generally glorious character and the film also benefits from heavyweight actors such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and Suet Lam, underrated. There is really no weak connection in the acting and one could easily believe that they are looking at real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are excellent, one of the most impressive aspects of Election is Johnnie To's eye for the camera. The film contains really striking shots and it goes without saying that to know how to frame his shots, the viewer receives a series of innovative and brilliant shots and camera angles. All of this makes Elections, above all, a great movie. <br /> <br /> My problems with the film stem mainly from the considerable number of characters involved in the election. It becomes a bit difficult to follow because the movie is so full of characters that are not part of the plot. While the sequel chooses to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the electoral process as a whole with tons of uncles, NCOs and policemen encircling the story. Perhaps the film would have worked better if it had been a little longer with more time devoted to the inner workings of the Triad, or if director Johnnie To channeled the elements needed to expose them more. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a wonderfully brutal film with excellent distribution, excellent direction and a quiet cadence that sets the tone. It's just a little more complicated than necessary.
