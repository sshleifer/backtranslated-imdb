And my kids love it now! Certainly, I can look at it now and realize that the animation was not terrible and that the plot is trivial. Hey, if all the villains came forward saying, "I'm mmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT", I think we can laugh at it, but for young kids, it's a moral story with catchy music. <br /> <br /> A music so catchy, that tells you, that I still had the words memorized after not having seen this film in twenty years. I would definitely recommend this one for young children.
