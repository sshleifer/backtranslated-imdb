My comment would have been added to the RELEASE DATE section, but I could not find a place for it. I was really surprised to see that this film was released in the United States in February 1955. I saw it in an "award-winning" theater in Washington, DC in March 1958. I wonder if the film was reissued or if there is a problem. ? In my opinion, this film is a very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. John McIntyre does an amazing job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan plays essentially the same role he played in Red River a few years ago. And, in my opinion, James Stewart is performing as well as ever. I have seen this film half a dozen times or more, and I do not get tired of reviewing some parts. The photography and the scenery are splendid and offer a remarkable amount of entertainment in an hour and thirty-six minutes.
