"Zabriskie Point" (1970): I was particularly interested on a personal level, because it was happening under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life ?? the counter-culture movement of the late 1960s / early 1970s on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young men into separate stories, which are slowly woven together. One is a young man from Los Angeles, tired of the endless and pseudo-revolutionary jabberas in the classrooms and dining rooms of his campus, and the other is a young woman who goes to Phoenix to see her father and his employer and "establishment" work. The film is FULL of the visual notations of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) on America, and, in the confusion, the psychedelicrazies of the perverts of this time, "we know everything, we will change everything for the better", the youth. Just who is the "revolutionary"? What does it REALLY mean? Do you dress like one and walk singing? Do you "fly under the radar" but prevent your arrival in advance? Do you keep your plans for yourself and dedicate yourself to the issue of change, without the need for group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "period piece" - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surrealistic cinematic moments (after all, it's a movie of the man who gave us the incredible " Blow Up "from 1966), as well as artifacts of the time. but it's more. It presents options for the cultural revolution and, according to Antonioni (who seems to support it), young people are too autonomous to see what it takes to succeed radically. As a result, it becomes a powerful and scary movie that applies to everyone, anytime, anywhere.
