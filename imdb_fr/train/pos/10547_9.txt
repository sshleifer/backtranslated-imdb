I watched the trailer on the DVD after watching the movie, and I think anyone who has seen it before watching the movie would be very surprised and perhaps disappointed. This was very much due to the fact that the film was "from the Cube director" and made it look like a horror movie, when in fact it's an absurd comedy (the IMDB spell checker does not seem to think that absurdist is a word, but that's it), as Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are dead. <br /> <br /> I like the way the story builds slowly at the beginning, then gradually grows. I also like the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film. This and the fact that the story is played primarily in one set are the only aspects for which this film looks like Cube. I recommand it.
