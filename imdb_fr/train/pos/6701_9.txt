I really liked the first 2 seasons. because a lot of good characters disappeared later. as most shows are a little slow at first, then improve in subsequent seasons, but the opposite is true. Jenny of the 1st season and Valarie of the 2nd season were friends of Sabrina, I did not care about the others, Jenny and Valaria were her best friends. I think for some reason the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode of season 1 is the clash of cats and my favorite episode of season 2 is the witch, this is the funniest episode. I also thought that the way Libby was popular was funny, but she was still jealous of Sabrina and never seemed to have a real boyfriend, but she still wanted to be with Harvey. I just wish they could make better ones. I also liked how the first two seasons, during the opening credits, Sabrina said a few words wearing a costume, as in the pilot episode where she is in the witch costume, I liked how she said "It's so not me" and later she kept trying to change something else, that's what I think, but it's a really cool show. it's a bit like the andy griffith show somehow because it's good at first, but once it turned to color and barney fife went away, it was better. but I still like to watch it, but the only reason I watch the next seasons is because of Sabrina. What I meant by the opening sequence is this: the opening titles of seasons 1 to 3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits, while the names of cast members are flashing rapidly at bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina would say a sort of pun on the outfit she wears and then disappear. the opening sequence of season four includes characters in bubbles. the season opening credits 5-7 presents Sabrina at various locations around Boston
