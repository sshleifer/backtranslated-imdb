Ignore the intrigue and enjoy Fred Astaire in A Foggy Day and several other dances, one in duet with the unfortunate Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what is essentially theater dances "in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers," and before he had learned to take full advantage of the film's potential. Best of all: the fact that we saw Burns and Allen before their comedy career on radio / television, doing the kind of dance they had to do in the vaudeville and did not have the chance to do it in their 30s movies at Paramount College. (George has already been a tap instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are highlights of the film and are worth the wait. The first trio of soft shoes is a warm up for the exciting carnival number "Chin up", in which the three sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. Fans of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worthwhile to be included in the "plot". I have already seen this one 4 or 5 times and find the fast forward button useful.
