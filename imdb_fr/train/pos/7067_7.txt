Although little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a strong personality and a voice admired in operatic singing. This 1937 film is his first major film and proves to be a real boon to Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART GIRLS is about three daughters of a divorced couple rushing to their father's long unseen home A faithful mother reveals that he may soon be remarried, with the firm intention of undermining his girlfriend, a researcher and give it back to his mother. Although the story is light, the screenplay is witty and the experienced players play a clean key. Durbin has a nice voice and an appealing personality, and actors as nice as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer complete the cast. Ultra-light entertainment for movie fans of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
