Fidois a very strange film. And in many ways, a very good one. <br /> <br /> My first thought after watching was how would they sell this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story mixes with a nostalgic comedy of the fifties with zombies. Do not stumble exactly. <br /> <br /> Fido has little carnage, laugh and Shaun's abdomen. This is another beast (forgive me the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido starts with a black-and-white information film that explains the story of the past - humans have won the war against zombies by developing a command collar that submits them to flesh eaters as dumb servants. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought we had fallen into a paranoia of the 1950s cold war, but we are quickly thrown into a world of bright primary colors and the mid-fifties. nostalgia for the class. <br /> <br /> The young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child who has no place in school. His mother is a potential climber and his father is nervous and detached. <br /> <br /> Seeking to keep pace with Jones, Mom (Carry-Anne Moss) bought a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at first, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) is soon a great friend for Jimmy. Until his necklace keeps flashing ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the movie is knowing exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> the humor is of light family type, and sometimes the plot is too dependent on the boy and his dog / family moments. <br /> <br /> However, the film is crossed by moments wonderfully dark and really fun. welcome, will provide a R rating for what is, for long periods, a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful and is beautifully interpreted by everyone involved. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything I hope that this film will find a place in its tone, because it is a gem in this year's crap deluge of cinematography.
