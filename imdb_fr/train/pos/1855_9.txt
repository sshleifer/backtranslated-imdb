Not having seen all the films released in 2002, I can not say that it's the best movie of the year. I can say it's the best movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American films starring blacks are obsessed with American concern about "interracial relations" or fall into the clich√©s of the ghetto of the city, with every stereotype imaginable in jargon . Antwone Fisher is proudly alone in this regard: the race is of no importance, except for a fight that may or may not have been caused by a racial insult. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher's story should resonate with any empathic individual. He is discreetly and thoughtfully represented by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, while obviously using his star power to make the film, remains largely in the background and allows the film to be the story of Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghettoisation of a large number of Americans (and Canadians, too, you know), this is a film that speaks to entire humanity. from U.S. I only hope that the non-black audience will go to see this film for this humanity, rather than avoid it, because they feel that there is no character or actor in the film with which they can identify. It would be a sad commentary on race relations in North America. <br /> <br />
