This movie is really funny! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, then go ahead and watch it. Her name is blonde and blonde, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What is this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a fun movie to watch at an appointment or with a company of friends (especially if you're not too sober.) Lol Pamela and Denise are still sexy. It is a mistake to consider this film as a work of art. Come on, this movie is about BLONDES! It's supposed to be light, funny and superficial. One last thing, I do not think girls will like and love this movie but that guys will certainly like it.
