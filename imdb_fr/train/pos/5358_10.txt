It's one of the great 80's movies of my collection I'm thinking about all the time. <br /> <br /> The Running Man is one of the best and most diverse Arnold films to date. When I saw The Running Man for the first time, I was so excited to see a movie like this. I love all the fights and it's really a special film. It also includes Jesse Ventura, the legendary Toru Tanaka professor, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr., who still seems to love death in his films killed in movies such as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2, and others. All Arnold fans should love this film from start to finish, because his action-packed action, his role as a star, and it is one of the best of Arnold so far!
