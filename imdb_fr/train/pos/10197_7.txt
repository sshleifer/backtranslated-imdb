It has been a long year and I have to see the last film in 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of the River) was ranked second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it did not work so well at the box office that it was too artistic for ordinary viewers, especially since MMFF is the season when many families go to see movies. <br /> <br /> It was quite intriguing to watch a movie that was not in Filipino or English playing on the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job both as a star and a director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as the main star and was able to express a wide range of emotions needed for the film. The young actress Rebecca Lusterio also performed well. She did a great job in describing Bikay, Duroy's youngest sister. I hope to see it in many other film projects in the future and maybe venture into other genres. I think that the fact that this film is in its local dialect really helped it. <br /> <br /> Some of the film shots were very successful. The scenery was breathtaking even though I felt that less effort would have been completely different. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story, I feel that the writers could have deepened the life of the less important characters of the film. I will certainly not go crazy about the story of this film.
