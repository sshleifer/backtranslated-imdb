Excellent entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful performances of Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and many action scenes. The film was made for me! Funny lines in the scenario, good music. Dalton as the hard sheriff and Railsback as "redneck-villain". I must recommend this movie to all action adventure fans! 10/10
