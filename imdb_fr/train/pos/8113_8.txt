This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the publishers slaughtered it after it opened in 1936. Visually, it's a marvel to see, but the screenplay allows too much intellectual talk about the war and progress. Given that we recite a lot of important messages at all times. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, present themselves as a pair of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as "The Boss", a megalomaniac warlord. The prediction of the Second World War was very worrying as the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in the history of humanity at the time. I'm glad the war did not happen like in the movie. There are some amazing editing sequences that bring the different episodes of the film together. Although it's not as entertaining as I hoped, this movie stays in your mind long after you've seen it.
