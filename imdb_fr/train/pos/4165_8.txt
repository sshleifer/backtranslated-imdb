No, this hilarious horror clinker from the 70s for television has nothing to do with a demonically possessed death cake. Even so, this exceptionally awful, but undeniably fun, and therefore enjoyable waste of cathode rays reaches a breathtaking peak of foolishness and outrageous, uncontrollable atrocities that is quite tasty in a track genre as execrable as possible. Richard Crenna, haggard and possibly intoxicated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she had never overcome the brutal rape she suffered in the "Jackson County Jail", slowly portrays a Disgusting and respectable commuter couple whose quaint, drab and sleepy existence is torn apart when the cute German shepherd they take as a family pet turns out to be an evil and deadly old spirit. Soon, Mimieux and her two very quiet children like Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (psychic extraterrestrial idiots from Disney's "Witch Mountain" images) love a coarse pencil drawing of the nasty canine entity of the den. Damn, does not that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing this ridiculously ridiculous ridiculous, certainly, but amusing, thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide"), Harrington's desperately weak leadership, his caricatural special effects (not so), almost painfully void, ridiculous plot, and a play cast that struggles valiantly with absurd story (apart from the lead actors, Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong appear briefly as members of a satanic cult and Victor Jory has a beautiful picture as a useful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the wicked Mephestophelion puts the misfortune on Crenna, forcing him practically to get stuck in a blade of lawn mower that turns wildly. While crisp and snobbish movie buffs may want to keep their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this fragrant schlock, fervent followers of TV in the garbage should consider this abominable and abominable title as a tube equivalent to Alpo.
