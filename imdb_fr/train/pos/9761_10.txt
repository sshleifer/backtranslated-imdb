Here is a film straight out of my childhood, that my family used to film; but it has somehow been exploited and lost over the years. Now, I had the chance to watch the entire movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I watched it as a child and after watching it (online), I still do it today. My favorite song of the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember this sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I watched the opening credits (about who animated who), that some of the animators go back to the 1930s (WOW !, it's been 47 years).
