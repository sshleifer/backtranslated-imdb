Now, I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler, but after that, quality dropped. Band Camp kept the standard high enough with characters that were close to your heart, but Naked Mile was the same joke and the same intrigues recycled (Erik Stifler's sexual problem is similar to Jim's). There were some fun times like the midget football match and Coozeman's "punishment", but overall it lacked originality and the "Mile" was just stupid and stupid. Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> In any case enough on the Naked Mile. I watched Beta House apprehensively as I thought it might bring the series to a new low, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there is no real plot, but it's filled with hot girls (Ashley is amazing) and profuse sex jokes. Yes, it's a formula and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exuberant performance. The Greek Olympiads entertain the penultimate and final events, while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious. There are weak points though. Coozeman is as annoying as he was in the first game, I am still puzzled by the role he played. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White has struggled to follow Naked Mile, but at Beta House, his performance is at its peak. Above all, it lacks charisma, a precondition for Stifler. You really can not care about him. The only reason I was worried about her relationship was so Ashley could be on screen! She shines above him, just like the rest of the cast. Seriously, John White is the best thing he can do and has as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> To say that the film entertains and that Coozeman fears that his daughter is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is worth renting. Invite some friends, laugh at the vomit party and let your anger go to Erik 'loser' Stifler.
