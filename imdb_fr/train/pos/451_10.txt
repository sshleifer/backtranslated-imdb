If anyone asks why nobody makes movies like before, with a conversation, a character and a simple friendship theme that strive to become something new, better and different, these people have to watch in this movie and see how and play that blends into a wonderful evening of observation on what was happening in Italy and England. Other days, at other times, they found themselves in a great comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the lead roles. Under the direction of Mike Newell, these actors perform remarkably memorable performances photographed with a subtly subtle painter's eye. Recalling the theatrical farce of the early twentieth-century bedrooms, this film could be called a farce of friendship that will become an interesting experience in the growth of the romantic nature of each character and the viewer. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring for those around us.
