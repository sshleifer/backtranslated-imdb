This film starts well, has a few slow moments in the middle, but generally advances well, has some very good moments, then ends at the end of act 3. I could see this twice in Los Angeles (with 2 ends different). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the main man of tomorrow. He is humorous and holds on, but he is best served as a supportive actor. Julia Stiles plays "well" in a comic role, a novelty for her, but she does not "steal" this film, as would a star of her caliber. For an actress who has so much potential (10 Things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to see her continue to play such "average" roles and not let her take the role and run away with the movie (as Daniel Day-Lewis did in "Gangs"). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does a 'ok' job. I did not expect an academic performance from her, and she did not offer one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another film "above average". The problem may lie more in the script than in anything else. I liked this film! But this is not a film in which you move away saying, "It was great!" ... this "story" was made so many times before and there was just not much new here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best of the movie, and Larry Miller gives an amazing performance in a secondary role (he could be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have a nice evening, I can still recommend this movie, but unless the end is changed ... again ... leave during the stage of the church, or you will surely be disappointed.
