Probably the most fancy slice of the first season, "Shore Leave" has its ups and downs; some parts are too long and others are unambiguously shortened, but there is no denying that they have thrown everything apart from the proverbial kitchen sink into an entertaining episode. Kirk and his crew seem to have found the ideal planet for shore leave after a long period of work that left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation, etc. It seems for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited land, with beautiful landscapes and an ideal climate. The first indication that things could go a little wrong is when McCoy, who leads an advanced team, spots Alice (from Wonderland) as a result of a big white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk radiates and discovers that others tell such bizarre events and encounters. The common point of all the members of the team is that everyone thought about the person / place / thing they discovered just before discovering it. It does not go immediately with Kirk or anyone else. More strangeness ensues, including the sighting of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a World War II fighter, and so on. Kirk meets Ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a despot of his time at the Academy, Finnegan. The pursuit / fight scene with Finnegan lasts too long, but at the same time, McCoy is executed with a spear by a knight on horseback and is apparently killed. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what happened. The planet is a futuristic "amusement park" where visitors only have to imagine something to make it appear. Nothing is forever; McCoy is not really dead. Once this is explained, Kirk decides to ask for leave on the ground for everyone. Despite the kind of ending "everything was dreamed", "Shore Leave" is another first-rate episode of the first season of Star Trek.
