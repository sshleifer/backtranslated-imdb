The film begins as a little less hyper-kinetic, more deadly: Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are practiced while bodies are discovered by police. But when a policeman is killed, a Tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he discovers that his brother, Shihito, is also involved, things get complicated very quickly. <br /> <br /> An earlier work by Miike, Shinjuku Triad Society He is still filled with his usual ultra-violent and sadistic sexual acts, although it is not one of his most eclectic works neither the most flamboyant. Rather, it's a pretty successful fiction, as Tatsuhito goes underground, a labyrinth that leads him to a triad gay leader who sells illegally acquired organs from his body in Taiwan and keeps a small brothel of young boys (one in particular the character who kills the cop at first). Tatsuhito's brother is involved in society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty policeman and use equally violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate this sordid kingdom. <br /> <br /> What is mainly interesting in this small work is the relationship between Tatsuhito and his nemesis Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, who then returned to Japan and insane for that. Wang is a Chinese man who felt insane in China. So he killed his father and developed a criminal branch in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearean character, which is quite strange, and even less that you start feeling sorry for him when his confrontation with Tatsuhito will be imminent. And Tatsuhito himself is an equally tragic figure when he is forced to face his inability to control his brother. It would be rude to say that Miike's films are successful mainly because of their shock value, but it is true that it is sometimes easy to lose sight of how Miike can create bitter and passionless characters. <br /> <br /> - -PolarisDiB
