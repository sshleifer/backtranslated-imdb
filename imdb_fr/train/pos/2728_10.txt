Simply one of the best ever! The adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel by Richard Brooks is truly an artistic achievement. A superb black and white cinematography (which should have won an Oscar), a mesmerizing score for Quincy Jones and outstanding performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as killers to perfection. This film was 0 for 4 at the Oscars and was not even nominated for the best movie while Dr. Doolittle was. Go understand! <br /> <br /> Even if you do not know the Clutter family as well as in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is as impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson, followed closely by R. Blake. Highly recommended!
