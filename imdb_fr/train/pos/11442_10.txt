<br /> <br /> So, not being a poet myself, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's effortless movement, which incorporates the beauty of nature into his own work, is captivating. Watch him stick reeds together in a canvas hanging from a tree for a few minutes while he talks about his work, then receive the gain when the camera is filming off. Let yourself be surprised by the ease with which it operates and then realize futility when a slight breeze annihilates the entire Web. <br /> <br /> Goldsworthy's genius apparently knows no bounds because his inspiration is nature itself. It is in the essential change of nature that his work, although complete in his own field, is complete.
