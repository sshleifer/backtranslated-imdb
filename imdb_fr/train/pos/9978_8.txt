I must say that I loved Vanishing Point. I saw the original, and it's a very good remake of it. Even if he did not follow the initial scenario (that's why I gave him 8 out of 10), he was still pretty good and it's probably a better scenario. <br /> <br /> Regarding the car, The comment of the DJ at the end about the Challenger that goes up to 185 mph in the bulldozers is quite unlikely (and if you look at it, the speedometer needle was swaying at 145-150), but even though I did not see it on the engine in any of the By starting the scenes where they show the engine, the original plot had a supercharged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say that aerodynamics do not allow it, today's Chrysler 300C, normally aspirated, can reach a top speed of 260 km / h. If you look at this thing, going on a road with it is like pushing a brick wall in the wind at 70 mph. In addition, in a wind tunnel test, if you installed an air dam on the Challenger, it would probably be more aerodynamic.
