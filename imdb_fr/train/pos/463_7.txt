Of course, the plot, the scenario and especially the casting are strong in the film. So many beautiful things to see. One aspect that I particularly liked is the idea of ​​the antagonist - the former Luzhini mentor (Turturro) - who works to his advantage. His chess opponent - a three-piece Italian dandy and cane - turns out to be a real gentleman and a very good chess player. To his credit, the "opponent" nobly adheres to the final plan to finish the final game of the championship posthumously (Luzhin pulled out a leaflet through the window - sad, but releasing it) through the unstable genius' widow ( Emily Watson.) In death, therefore, because of the gallantry of an honorable master of chess, the defense of Luzhin (which he elaborated in a moment of late lucidity) is allowed to be played. The Italian congratulates the game and calls it brilliant. You talk about a dramatic "end of game!"
