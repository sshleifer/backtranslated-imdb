MacArthur is a good movie with a great story about a great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This is of course the story of one of the great American military figures, a figure who was familiar to me from the first moments of my memory. Although there is a continuity problem (there may be others), e.g. The MacArthur speech described in the film while addressing the US Military Academy at the US Military Academy in 1962 did not contain the phrase "old soldiers never die, they simply disappear." (It was in his speech to Congress about his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not agree!) Philippines in the Second World War. The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his military career. This film would have a much greater meaning for a regular in the Second World War and the Korean War. Nevertheless, the portrait that Peck gives of this great man who fought the two evils of fascism and communism and hated war as the only soldier possible is memorable. "At war, nothing can replace victory."
