I really liked this film because it's a true story that takes place in the Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe that a condensed form of the book was published in "Reader's Digest" shortly after the event. <br /> <br /> Because I am a "baby-boomer", the character and the actress are my contemporaries. That's why I talked about the movie I also believe the film is useful for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character following the waterways that lead to the river and the coastal villages where she can get help, as well as other survival skills. The most important was his willingness to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that viewers will learn something, in addition to seeing it for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I wish the film to be released in VHS and DVD as soon as I wish to add it to my collection of videos. . It should also appear more often on satellite movie channels.
