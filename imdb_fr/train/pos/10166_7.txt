I watched it during an 8 hour flight and (probably because of the pressure and altitude) I found it rather entertaining (with a focus on the "soft"). <br /> <br /> The real idea behind the film was brilliant: one woman dies, her fianc√© falls in love with another, she decides to make sure they do not meet, but she has finally allowed to do it. Unfortunately, the movie itself was not so good. OK, there was some laughter and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning, the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. I think the whole part of the story dedicated to gay but not gay friends could have been much better worked. The talking parrot was a good idea, but to be honest: it was not really very funny. <br /> <br /> In summary, the movie was more interesting than watching the seat in front of me, but it was close. call.
