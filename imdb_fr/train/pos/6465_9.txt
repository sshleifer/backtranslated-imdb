This film, recently voted a public favorite at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, inspires and moves. A famous conductor, forced to retire because of illness, returns to his small native village to become the choir leader of the church and finally finds fulfillment in his music. Based on the Swedish characteristics of keeping things in oneself and on the island character of a small Swedish village, this film develops well each of its characters. Superbly directed, played and sung, he brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all. Hopefully he will find a distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, see it!
