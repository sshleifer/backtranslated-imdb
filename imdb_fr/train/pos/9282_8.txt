In Iran, women are not admitted to football games. Officially, it is because they must be spared by the vulgar language and behavior of the male public. But of course, it's about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and held in a sort of cage, until the police come to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Despite the senseless situation, this film is full of humor. It is also encouraging to see that people are always finding different ways to fight against oppression. You will be touched at the same time as you will have a lot of laughs. Good job of director Jafar Panahi. It's in many ways a heroic comedy.
