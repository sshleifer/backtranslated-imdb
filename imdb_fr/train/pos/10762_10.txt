I was one of many who expected to see a glorified representation, a Yankee-doodle dandy, of a day that, as it is said, should live in infamy rather than glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there right in the middle, and the images they sent back are both amazing and heartbreaking. And yet, all this happened during an unplanned trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French directors were making a documentary about the firefighter life in New York , especially from the point of view of a young recruit. to come in the ranks. At first we see a lot of these images just to remind us that there was no intention of producing a film about terrorism. It was a film about ordinary people who honestly earned their living helping others. The beauty of the film is that it never loses this advantage. <br /> <br /> When investigating a suspicious gas line (I think, my memory is a little blurry about it), we suddenly hear a plane fly over the area. The camera bends to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself in one of the towers. What should the cameraman think about this moment? Recognizing the importance of the footage on which the camera stays on, and perhaps realizing the same thing, the FDNY allows the camera to follow them into the building. <br /> <br /> The following is a faithful view of the front lines. We see the commitment of the FDNY, its reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person die of sorrow are frightening), as well as the collapse of one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera records events from outside. <br /> <br /> If it was not the horrible event they covered, the film would be the only dream of any young doco maker come true. Quite simply, the film deserves to be preserved forever. But what really distinguishes this film is the true humanity it brings to the viewer. We see firefighters charge without hesitation, people of different races helping each other to escape a surge of rubble and even the worries of directors (they are brothers) because they can not reach each other in confusion. This film contains incredible scenes as well as incredible human stories, which Hollywood could never reproduce (even if it tries). <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a movie about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad. 9/11 is a film about people, and a faithful indication of the best and the worst of which we are capable. 9/11 is simply one of the most important films I have ever seen, and would be the only film to come out of this event if it were up to me. You can not duplicate that.
