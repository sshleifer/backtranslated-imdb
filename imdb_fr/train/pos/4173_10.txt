A kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the province of Slowenian at the end of the summer. At first, you see someone in underwear sewing black cloth trousers, and when the same young man in black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases, you find that the part of the pants is missing on a flag of mourning (apparently his father died). In the train, he meets a young woman almost without words, but with many small gestures, a wonderful love story begins. It's a surreal film, very poetic and a little odd, with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details.
