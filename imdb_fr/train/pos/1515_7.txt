Amicus made nearly half a dozen of these horror anthologies in the '70s, and that's from one of their best efforts, by leading horror scribe Robert Bloch. There are four stories, all interesting, but two - "Sweets For The Sweet" and "Method For Murder" - stand out as highly effective journeys in fear. <br /> <br /> In "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose pretty girl (Chloe Franks) makes fun of her carelessness and brutal intolerance. She sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her disgust for her methods. Franks is a beautiful evil evil figure and offers one of the greatest childish performances in a horror movie since Martin Stephens in "The Innocents". This episode is done with great subtlety and the final indignation, which occurs off-screen, is a moment of pure horror. <br /> <br /> "Method of Murder" talks about a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) threatened by one of his own creations, the terrifying Dominic. This episode is striking for its simplicity and extreme terror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a good time playing with our expectations. Dominic's short shots reflected in a pond or perceived as an ephemeral fantasy in a meadow are truly haunting. <br /> <br /> The original poster, depicting a skeleton holding a tray holding Peter Cushing's severed head, was rich in appeal to punters fixed on fear.
