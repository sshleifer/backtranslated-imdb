I saw this film at the 18th Haifa Film Festival, and it's one of the best I've seen this year. Seeing it on a big screen (and BIG, not one of those TV screens that most movie theaters have) with an excellent audio system still enhances the cinematic experience, as the movie takes control of your eyes and ears and you aspire in the story, the photo. <br /> <br /> The film presents a set of characters slightly interconnected. Their stories intersect at times, and the multiplicity of lines reminded me a lot of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. But the true hero of the film is obviously the city of Madrid, which serves as a backdrop to the entire film. It houses the characters, contains the sidewalks and roads they walk on and sets the background for all events, all in beautifully filmed scenes. <br /> <br /> The film comes back again and again on certain themes (shoes for example), and in essence, Salazar makes his metaphors more and more comprehensible to the viewer as the film progresses. It combines the views of the city with the images of the characters and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background. A group of talented actors allows him to photograph a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin takes Anita to the streets for the first time. It may not work on a small screen, but it made me go easy on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is very positive and, as a result, the film is sometimes light and fun. The music that accompanies the film is usually pop, with some instrumental pieces (I hope to get my hands on the soundtrack one day, even if I doubt very much to know it). <br /> <br /> All together, I came out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you'll have to take my word for it). For this and more, I give this film a solid 8/10.
