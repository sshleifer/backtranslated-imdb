Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows that something, like dance, can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human mind. <br /> <br /> Dance is considered the expression of existence and the birth of individuality. This is certainly the case of Aoki. At work, he is a modest office man, but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled intensity is released. Surprisingly, this publication is frowned upon in Japan because of the rigid culture of compliance. At the beginning of the film, all the characters are ashamed or afraid of their desire to dance. They will be despised, or considered perverse, for expressing their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen to witness the rebirth of emotions and human passions. This will leave a smile on your face for days.
