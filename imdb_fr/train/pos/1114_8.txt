At the time, I remember being very surprised and amused by this film. I called it the most important film I've seen in a decade, and I ran into people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has a particularly insightful behavioral book. And she shaped the bitter teenage personality we all had in a corrosive and adult worldview. The two together provide a surprising mix that may be too edgy for some viewers. (Hi Skip, I wish you were not my brother so that I could **** you!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards is looking after his return to Los Angeles from New York, which leads to immersive test of various personalities (all of which are badly suited) to our amusement, but enough of them involve acting to appeal to a system of values ​​"imperative black" according to which the true barometer of his resituation is to know if the Black culture will accept it. (It's been a while since Nina Simone comes to mind, and she has an awesome black lover solidly built in the movie.) A pretty black girl attends the show and seems to allow Sandra's false darkness, but ultimately rejects her. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics consider themselves lucky to suffer for Christ, Sandra represents herself here as suffering from a black culture in which she aspires to occupy a place; as if she cherished her dignity and rejection. This is the only value system involved in the world of cinema, apart from the artistic confusion of Bernhard. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main problems are racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the two subjects treated atypically. way.
