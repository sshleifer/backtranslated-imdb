I saw this movie while it was in a limited version, mainly for the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen of the year. It starts almost like a thriller, but steadily progresses in a hilarious work full of one-liners and great comic energy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Moreover, even if I say that this film is a comedy, it does not forget that it sometimes has a heart and that it can be very touching when it is necessary. When I went to the theater, I did not know what to expect, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. When I left the cinema, I felt very fulfilled by the film and I intend to see it again in large format. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good comedy with a well-written script and a big mustache.
