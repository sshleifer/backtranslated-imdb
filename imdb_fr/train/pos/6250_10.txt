Austrian films have something special not only of Seidl, but also of Spielmann and other directors. It is the keen sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the film. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the illustrated stories, but also by the actors who play. At Hundstage, I never felt that actors are playing, but real people. The visceral sensation of the viewer is so real ... almost as if the grumpy pensioner or the lonely lady of the film lived below you in your neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Anyone living in Vienna can undoubtedly suffer to recognize the people in the film with their meckern / sudern (complain), their hidden sexual impulses and prolo macho guys. This is further reinforced by the Viennese dialect which, according to many, is specially designed to complain as a way of life. The typical steeple and arrogance of Vienna are also very well described. <br /> <br /> The Viennese suburbs are very present in the film with their stupor and their somnolence where nothing happens. In addition, they were transformed into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and department stores. Between the two are the houses of the people where they indulge in what they consider to be activities that give pleasure, trying to keep in touch with their human being, but in vain. Examples are the old lady's sexual game with the men who have been close to rape, the prolific guy who loses his nerves and strikes his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers. <br /> <br /> The film has no soundtrack because it focuses only on the normality / abnormality of its images. Another typical feature of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) is his projection of disturbing images of a sexual nature. This includes the old woman's striptease for her husband, the sex scenes in the bath, the woman's sex play with the two men in her apartment, and so on. <br /> <br /> At Hundstage, Seild portrayed the lives of people who could possibly be as Viennese as citizens of Paris, New York or Madrid. Spectators should not despise or feel pity for the Viennese in the film, as they themselves could become victims of the same human annoyance and alienation, even under different circumstances. In the end, I think Seidl's movie warns us of the terrible state of human relations so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation, Seidl has achieved his goal.
