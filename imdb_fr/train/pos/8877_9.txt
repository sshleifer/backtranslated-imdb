This story is probably one of the most powerful that I have ever admired. John Singleton has certainly exceeded expectations in preparing this educational masterpiece. Brilliant performances by the actors, but Epps and Rapaport were the best and the most convincing of the career of one or the other young star. <br /> <br /> However, as a university student, many of the issues raised by Singleton were addressed. to the extreme. In a sense, although they are problems encountered on many university campuses, they are not presented as openly or openly as the film would like. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something like this could really happen. However, apart from the fact that it was a little too dramatic, the movie was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to speak, just think. One of the things in this picture that I will remember forever is a quote from Lawrence Fishburn's character: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge you can not see your power." Brilliant, just great.
