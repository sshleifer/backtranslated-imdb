I liked the movie. Some action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I particularly liked the opening scene in which was a truck semi-trailer. A very tense action scene that seemed well done. <br /> <br /> Some transition scenes have been filmed in interesting ways, such as accelerated photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. Also the film is funny is composed of several parts. I also liked how the bad guy was described. I would give the film an 8 out of 10.
