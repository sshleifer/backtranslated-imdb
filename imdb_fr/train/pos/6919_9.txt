"Winchester '73" marked the first in a series of westerns involving James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As in most of them, Stewart's hero has a violent front that threatens to explode at any moment. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a "one in a thousand" rifle that may be competing in a shootout at Dodge City on July 4, 1876. Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his High Spade acolyte (Millard Mitchell) join the city and pursue the Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for a despicable past act. They arrive just in time to see Field Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) take the girl out of the Lola (Shelley Winters) living room in town. It turns out that the Dutchman Henry is also in town for rifle shooting. Lin and the Dutch Henry compete for the coveted prize. Lin and the Dutch Henry deprive Lin of the gun and escape. <br /> <br /> Lin and High Spade drag the dutch Henry across the country where they meet Lola with his handsome coward Steve Miller (Charles Drake) resists in an American cavalry camp while waiting for an attack Indians, led by Young Bull (Rock Hudson), who acquired the precious rifle by assassinating the rifle John McIntyre. He had the weapon by deceiving the Dutchman Henry in poker. Young Bull is killed in the attack and the weapon goes to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet the notorious Waco shooter Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea) who kills Steve and takes the valuable shotgun and Lola for himself. When Dean meets Dutch Henry, he allows him to recover "his weapon" and plans to murder him later. In the city of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean, while the plans of the Dutchman Henry go badly and he escapes into the hills with Lin in pursuit. In one of the best final shots of all time, both meet in the final showdown. <br /> <br /> I think this film is the only film from the collaboration between Stewart and Mann to have been shot in black and white. He is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the "big spaces" and in particular, the final confrontation. Stewart plays against the guy, plays the hero with a strong motive of violent revenge, an emotion that he would transmit in future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> As in most universal westerns, this one can boast contract players of the day. In addition to those mentioned above, JC Flippen appears as a cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as newcomers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle play various roles in the Dodge City sequence. <br /> <br /> A classic western in every sense of the word. He was responsible for restoring Stewart's career as a star of the action.
