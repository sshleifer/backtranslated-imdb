I filmed this movie on TVHier tonight and you know that Danny Masterson was a very good actor in the film and that it's great to see him in a show other than the 70s. The film is not rated but I think I would only rate it because of the nudity and richness of adult content. But all in all I liked it, I thought Dirt's witches were pretty funny. This is basically a guy who has no job, friend or money and who ends up getting a private investigator position (a messenger really.) The people who really need the job 'help. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
