In 1993, after the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit show to produce a feature film, originally intended for Direct-To-Video, but which went to the theater. . status. He would be known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we had three more feature films for WB boys, Sub-Zero, The Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family. <br /> <br /> The intrigue is fundamental and in many ways resembles Mask of the Phantasm: a new militant woman dressing up after Batman began targeting the operations led by the Gotham crowd leader, Rupert Thorne, and Oswald Cobblepot, AKA, The Penguin. Now, Batman must try to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before crossing the line. <br /> <br /> The animation corresponds to the more refined and futuristic style used for the fifth and sixth seasons of Batman: The Animated Series (AKA The new adventures of Batman). it's pretty well done and just as elegant as the Joker Return animation. CGI is also used, but it is minor compared to its overabundance in Sub-Zero. The music was good. Different and exotic and similar to the score of the Justice League, although the points in the score when the old animated theme of Batman will be evoked are sure to send waves of nostalgia through the rodent-shaped hearts of the oldest fans . <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does a great job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also a pleasure to meet the Batman alumni: The Animated Series; including Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Bullock Detective), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl); she refers to the romantic relationship with Bruce mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred). <br /> <br /> The villains were also great, especially since Rupert Thorne, the former mafia boss of the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> Although not reaching the level set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, the MOTB keeps the torch pretty good for Batman animated films. And if you have the DVD and you're a hardcore fan, you'll love the five-minute Chase Me short film.
