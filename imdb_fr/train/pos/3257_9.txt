I just watched this movie for the second time on TV. It's charming, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I've rarely seen actors better able to reveal, through their movements and gestures, the love of another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply surpass themselves . Masterson probably has the toughest role and is just adorable. <br /> <br /> The film is in the vein of two romantic movies such as While you slept, When Harry meets Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the kinds of "high gimmick" of Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue married. I do not like saying that, because this cast was superb and I would never change any of them - but I think it did not work out as well as the movies mentioned above, because the appeal of The box office cast was not as big as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time of filming. <br /> <br /> The writing is not perfect - the lines of the characters are not particularly memorable. Yet he is executed to perfection. <br /> <br /> The romantic aspirations are really palpable, the "feeling" of the people who fall in love is exquisitely communicated, the timeless character of the love and its embracing impulse, the feeling of loss and the desire to find this connection, are so touching delivered. Again and again, you will find yourself moved. In fact, a comparable film is Made in Heaven - the same romantic desire. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, it's charming.
