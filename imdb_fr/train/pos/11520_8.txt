The road movie par excellence ... if your idea of ​​a road movie involves three so-called magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani. (Well, one in four is not bad ...) A wizard without talent, gifted for the sense of the show (Max) observes a very good pickpocket (Hugo) who practices his trade in New York. After convincing Hugo that he (Max) was a) mental and b) desperately looking for a partner to realize his dream of becoming a magician of the scene, the duo, which is not so dynamic, uses to the management expertise of an inventor of illusions (Milo) and the, ah, softer attributes of a charming waitress (Lydia). The four likely stack in a van (obtained by Hugo ... you guess where it comes from) and head to Vegas. Havoc follows. Anyway, it's funny, it's well written and the end is surprisingly good. A solid comedy with a warm heart, and so much the better that it was totally unexpected.
