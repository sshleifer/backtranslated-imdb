Michael Jackson is not very popular in the United States, but in Europe (especially in Germany), he still has a lot of fans. Many will say that it is a bad film, and it is: it has no plot, it is full of clichés, Michael is constantly renting. <br /> <br /> BUT, you can not expect a conspiracy or non-clichés in this kind of movie! It has fun visual effects and the music is perfect. The Smooth Criminal fragment - the biggest song of all time, consisting of Moonwalks, group numbers and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this film one of Jackson's masterpieces with a Michael even more beautiful (and white ...) Jackson! <br /> <br /> A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance act fans. <br /> <br /> However, as I am a fan of MJ, I should warn you all the enemies of Michael Jackson: do not watch this movie, you would only strengthen your hate ...
