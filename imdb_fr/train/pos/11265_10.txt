I never really knew who Robert Wuhl was before I saw that. But after seeing him, I realized how funny he was. This special HBO show presents him in his teaching of "American history" to film students at New York University. He made fun of almost all the important historical events not only in the United States but also in other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me wonder if what I consider a true infallible story is really true. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the fact that Mr. Wuhl was able to mix useful information with a good comedy and make learning a lot more exciting. I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and willing to question their beliefs.
