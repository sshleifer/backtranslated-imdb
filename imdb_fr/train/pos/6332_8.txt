This film is good for television. I like that because I'm a huge fan of disaster movies, even if it's a family film. The accuracy on the film of the book is half and half. They gave the names of the characters but in the book there was no storm runner, the car scene involving the Hatch family fleeing the tornado was not in the book instead involved Dan hatch and his friend at horse with a police officer on the way to the police station for safety. and in the book, Dan and his friend are both 12 years old. That's all I can think of. Overall, it was a good movie although it could have been a little more accurate compared to the book. Did you know that the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
