As I write this, I see that out of more than 15,000 votes, he has a score of 5.8. Something is wrong with this picture. Personally, I give it a 10. I can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it has been rated by people who see this movie as it really is. It's a movie based on a cartoon hero. This film has won more than its share of price. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations ... tells me it's better than 5.8. Some good actors, very good actors, excellent special effects and, in my opinion, will otherwise be a classic for years to come. If you're looking for pure entertainment, be sure to check out Dick Tracy. Certainly a movie that you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is awesome as Big Boy Caprice.
