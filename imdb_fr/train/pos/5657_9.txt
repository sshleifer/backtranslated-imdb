I remember watching American Gothic on his first appearance, it came to my mind recently, all I could remember was the same guy that appeared in Midnight Caller, it's Gary Cole, I'm watching little TV, but I bought the full series on DVD this week, and it's still as good as ever. This is one of the best TV series of all time. If I do not watch a lot of television, it's because it's just garbage, except for Derren Brown. all reality shows or soaps, such as Grease, Big Brother, etc., I'm fed up, I got the full set of US Gothics at Â£ 16.97 on Asda's website, it's is the cheapest I can find.
