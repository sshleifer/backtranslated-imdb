I am tired of people who judge films on their "historical accuracy". THIS IS A PEOPLE OF FILM !! Writers and directors are supposed to give their own story! Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans ... are all fantastic movies are slightly inaccurate historically. If you want to see some great actors do what they do best, then I suggest you watch this movie without worrying about the accuracy of the facts. Simply enjoy the quality of the film, the screenplay and one of the greatest actors of our time.
