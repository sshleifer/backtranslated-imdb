The distribution is excellent, the acting, the intrigue interesting, the evolution full of suspense ... but it is difficult to gather all these elements in a film of just 80 minutes. If we took more time to develop the plot and the subplots, the effect would be much better. Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this film a very good film rather than a quality film.
