that's the best illustration of what Jesus really meant to be. most movies show that Jesus is effeminate, lobotomized or tortured. that Jesus laughed, played, and was serious when it was necessary. it's the kind of jesus that people might be attracted to, not the usual Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The film took liberties, trying to "fill the gaps". but the charges did not seem impossible, nor even improbable. One thing I could argue is that he never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the movie describes that the Romans were the main cause of the death of Jesus, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea). <br /> <br /> it seemed that the film had been well studied. an example was the casual comment to a teenager called "mark". it is thought that this mark (or john mark) was the boy mentioned in the garden of gethsemane whose coat had been removed and had fled naked (mark 14:51). I feel that they have tried to make the film as accurate as possible (even in his mind).
