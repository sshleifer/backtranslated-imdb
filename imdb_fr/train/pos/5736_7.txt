Dumland focuses on the life of a family (American?) ... The father; a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use blasphemy and who has no redeeming qualities. The mother; who seems to be a paranoid psychotic, never says much. The son; an obscure repetitive little boring boy. The animation is simple and rudimentary, but it fits well with the stories and characters. The episodes were originally only available on the davidlynch.com website, but have now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD and a brief summary follows: <br /> <br /> 1- The neighbor: We meet the neighbor next door and discover three things about him ... he has a very nice shelter, he has only one arm and likes to do bad things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- The treadmill: we discover that the woman has an affinity for exercise, but the husband does not really think it's a good idea. In the end, the treadmill is victorious. <br /> <br /> 3- The doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with exposed electric wire ... the doctor's examination is quite complete (if not unconventional) but the diagnosis is "you are perfectly normal "(but we knew it well). <br /> <br /> 4- A friend visits: after an altercation with the new portico, a friend comes to visit him (believe it or not, but after we met him, we can understand why ), no surprises when he tells us his hobbies. <br /> <br /> 5- Get The Stick: We meet another neighbor, he has a stick stuck in his mouth (although we never know how he got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from the mouth of his neighbor ends up being harder (and more violent) than expected ... but he is finally victorious ... Jesus, some people can be thankless !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My teeth bleed: It was my favorite episode ... and also the most repetitive and the most annoying (um, what does that say about me?). I do not know why his son's teeth started to bleed, but believe me when I say it was minimal for the plot of the story. What is an oxymoron, as history had no plot. <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we clearly feel that Dumbland's gene pool is very superficial. . Uncle Bob is a sick man (I will not elaborate, for fear of spoiling him). Uncle Bob's wife is definitely wearing his family's pants ... and the father is definitely on the wrong side of his loose fist (and spends the rest of his visit huddling in a tree in the backyard ). <br /> <8- Ants: after the house has infiltrated ants and a malicious attempt to mop them has been eliminated ... it ends up spilling itself to the face with the insecticide and began to hallucinate. The ants organize a song and a fabulous dance show ... he gets mad trying to kill them, finds himself wrapped in a bandage for the whole body ... and let's just say that the ants take their revenge at the end. <br /> <As bad as these stories are, there is something that has always made me look at them. They give another idea of ​​the spirit of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were an outlet for him, to get rid of some of his violent thoughts ?? In fact, I laughed a lot on several occasions during the episodes. Many aspects are absurdly funny !!
