In August 1980, the disappearance of the girl Azaria Chamberlain and the consequent trial of her parents, Lindy and Michael, for the alleged murder of the child, caused an uproar in what was then a very angry country. The media and the public had already tried and sentenced the accused couple and shouted at the blood. What followed was a serious miscarriage of justice. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Chamberlain claimed that while camping near Ayers Rock in central Australia, a dingo had taken their ten-week-old daughter out of their tent as they prepared to eat in the barbecue area. Nobody believed them. Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and Michael, an accomplice after the fact. The whole country was boiling with rumors of a ritual massacre. The chamberlain's trial was over before it began. <br /> <br /> Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was convicted. There has never been enough evidence to convict her, but the jury has been influenced by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation even sit in judgment? Where are we from, how could we assume to know? The Chamberlains should have been acquitted unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt. <br /> <br /> Fred Schepisi's film unreservedly supports the argument in John Bryson's novel that the Chamberlains were perfectly innocent. charges against them. In fact, a dingo took baby Azaria on this fatal night at Ayers Rock. <br /> <br /> Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a bloodthirsty nation, hell being determined to bring to light "the truth". It shows Australia in a rather unpleasant way as a people totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay! His script, co-written with Robert Caswell, arouses strong emotions and will certainly find the public saddened and irritated by the parody of justice that has taken place. <br /> <br /> The excellent Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as a woman accused of the most terrible acts. She embodies in a very convincing way the tough little Australian who was ready to stand up to the accusations and put the world back on the table. Even his accent is almost, but not quite, clear. A very good effort of the master of this profession. Sam Neill is as good as Streep as the first faithful, but then disillusioned, Michael who does not understand why their world breaks down and begins to question his Christianity. Just like Streep, his shows a great emotional force that will touch you deeply. All the actors are also excellent. Some of the best Australian actors and actresses play a role. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is also brilliant. The director of photography, Ian Baker, captured with splendor this magnificent country (notably the Rock). Editor-in-chief Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and emotionally charged, while Bruce Smeaton delivers a revealing score. <br /> <br /> For all Australians, this is a must, a shocking look in the mirror if you As a country, we acted in favor of a family who simply wanted that justice be done and the truth known. As Michael Chamberlain said, "I do not think anyone really understands what innocence means to the innocent." <br /> <br /> Saturday, May 20, 1995 - Video <br /> <br /> Even during the return screenings, Fred Schepisi's story about the parody of justice that hit the Chamberlains, who lost the Azaria's child at Ayres Rock in 1980, is still emotionally powerful and moving. <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell have an expertise that has transferred John Bryson's novel to the screen, simply telling the horrific story of a terribly failed vacation for Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, including his new daughter, Azaria , was taken in the family tent by a dingo a few moments after being shot. <br /> <br /> In the midst of media speculation and vicious public rumor, Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and Michael was later charged with an accessory. What followed was little more than a media trial, and as the Australian people decided to fire her, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, even though the prosecution could present no motive or indirect proof. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is at the top of her game as an accused woman who is fighting Australia to prove her innocence. She's really great, and the only thing that fails is a real Australian blue accent, even if she does her best to sound good. You may wonder why a leading Australian actress was not chosen for the role, but the power of the stars is probably the answer. Along with Meryl, Sam Neill is just as impressive, as remarkable as the husband who sees his world collapse before his eyes, while he feels helpless in the face of everything. <br /> <br /> The editing of Jill Bilcock is coming to a close, cinematography of rock and other places of Ian Baker is visually brilliant and Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the piece. Really a must for all conscientious Australians. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
