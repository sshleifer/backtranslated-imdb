This very curious movie about the war and its effects on some people is sandwiched between San Francisco and the captains. Two of Spencer Tracy's biggest roles are brave. Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they shot together and Gladys George as a woman who loves them both. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone are part of the World War I recruits, Tone is a weak character who almost passes the hill in training camp, but Tracy prevents him. Tracy still plays the younger, more seductive type of Wallace Beery that the MGM envisioned for him when they untied him from Fox. <br /> <br /> On the front, Tone has an opportunity and seizes him when he manages to get to a church steeple that scans a nest of German machine guns. He has already learned how to shoot and he is doing Sergeant York. But Alvin C. York has never changed the war like Tone did. <br /> <br /> Wounded in battle, Tone convalesce in a hospital under the supervision of Gladys George. Tracy is going to visit his friend himself and he and George are doing something. Later, when Tracy is missing in action, Tone and George get married. Tracy is heartbroken when he returns and learns the wedding, but sits down in the wake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film deals with Tone, who applies the warfare techniques he has learned to gangster. He is now a jack of all trades and George does not really know what he is doing in life. I think you can understand the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that was a problem was that I can not believe that Gladys George could not understand it. She's a classy girl on the street, her role is very similar to the one she played in the Roaring Twenties, the opposite of James Cagney. <br /> <br /> About the roaring twenties, the development of Humphrey Bogart's character is similar to that of Tone although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, there are elements of They gave him a weapon found in Taxi Driver and Clint Eastwood's classic The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences of the First World War are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin shot this movie, I think it's a lot better than what he's attributed to it.
