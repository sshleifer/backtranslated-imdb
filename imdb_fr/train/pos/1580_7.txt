This is not another glowing look at the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small Berlin street and some of the people who took part. The film begins in New York City where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) is mourning the death of her husband and family members have joined him. Ruth's daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade). She goes to Germany and locates the 90-year-old woman who tells him about the events at Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943 where the Gestapo would organize all Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse, even though they were supposed to be immune to marriage with Aryans and for nine days, a group of women would be waiting outside and demanding their release. Ruth (Svea Lohde), eight years old, is waiting for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go, but she meets Lena (Katja Riemann), 33, who welcomes her. Fabian (Martin Feifel), her husband, is also inside and ends up trying to socialize with Nazi officers to get them to act. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Margarethe von Trotta who made her first feature film in almost 10 years after working on television. of her most provocative efforts, she remains one of the most respected directors in Europe. This is not one of those Nazi movies where we see horrible acts of inhumanity towards Jews, although we see some harsh treatment being delivered, but it is rather a story of a small event that has meant life or death to the people involved. This film does not try to shock anyone or open the door to debates about the circumstances, but it simply wants to shed light on a small but real life event that happened during a historical period. Part of the strength of the film comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine particularly through Riemann and the young Lohde and it's always good to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in a pivotal role. It's not a good movie or something that will change your view of World War II, but since innocent lives have been put to death because of the events that have occurred, I think this reason alone is important enough to tell this true story.
