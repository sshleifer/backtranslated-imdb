This is an excellent but difficult to find triumphant WWI spying thriller in the inimitable 60's Italian style. From the psychedelic graphics of Ennio Morricone's introductory credits and superb score to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the apocalyptic no man's battle scenes elaborated with poison gas and German cavalry in "storm" outfit, a movie not to be missed. It's a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the cruelty of players on and off the battlefield. In addition to the battle scenes, some of the special effects and production are primitive, apparently because most of the budget allocated to this film has been saved for battle scenes, but that should not be a problem for fans of 1960s cinema. I first saw this film on television many years ago and I had the foresight to record it on VHS. I still have the tape and I like to see her from time to time.
