On the beach is the only other movie, aside from Soylent Green, to have such a sense of hopelessness. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet of the cataclysms caused by man. On the beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the poisoning of the planet for the environment. <br /> <br /> There may be reason to be optimistic, because in 2007, we had not reached any of the worlds described in these films and were supposed to do so now. The city of New York still has about 8 million inhabitants, not the 22 million by the turn of the millennium described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists still salute this film as showing the consequences of global warming. For me, it also shows that the ethics of the right to life is a success. Obviously, there is no family planning in this world either. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is an NYPD detective who lives with roommate Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember the Earth before the disaster. A murder was committed. Joseph Cotten, leader of the company Soylent Corporation, is a multinational company that has developed a food product, a kind of cake of all colors to feed the world population. The latest product is Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> The investigation revealed that Charlton Heston was looking for his man, but it also revealed some horrible truths about Soylent society and the future of humanity. While Heston screams in the end that Soylent Green is made of people, that we have become a race of cannibals, the horror is that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet and we must eat our dead to survive. <br /> <br /> It was Edward G. Robinson's farewell show, and in his memoirs Heston spoke with emotion about Robinson even though they had different political views. . A few weeks after Robinson completed the final scene of his disappearance on the screen by consensual euthanasia, he died in real life. Few people knew, but Heston knew that Robinson was terminally ill and that the scene of death that separated them was not acting. <br /> <br /> Although the timing is not precise, it does not mean that the world envisaged by Soylent Green could not succeed. I hope we will not only have the intelligence, but the sense of shared responsibility to prevent this from happening.
