Marion Davies stars in this remarkable comedy "Show People", published by the MGM in 1928. Davies stars in Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with his father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy in which they arrive is a delusion, as is the scandalous costume of South Davies. Davies gets a job in the blinding comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow William Haines, her film star, who is immediately in love with her. Davies then finds work in a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and gets a job in stifling vintage pieces. A beautiful but fake actor (Andre Telefair) explains how to become the pretentious star of Hollywood. Davies abandons her father and her comic friend for the good life, but of course learns that she is not what she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful overall, because she - outrageously - covers the gamut of emotions required of a "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual marvelous comic character, and there are cameos from Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of the day, including the film's director, King Vidor. It's a silent movie with some "sound effects" because the sound images were just starting to take shape. A treasure of film.
