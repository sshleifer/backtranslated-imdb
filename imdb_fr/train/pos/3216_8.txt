A stoic and laconic soldier, Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance of Kurt Russell, always reliable), is thrown on a sorry planet after being deemed obsolete by the ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (deliciously played with slimy skin by Jason Isaacs), who has Todd and his fellow soldiers are being replaced by an advanced new breed of genetically modified fighters. Todd joins a torn and peaceful community of self-governing pariahs and must defend this community as new soldiers arrive for an exercise on the ground. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, using an intelligent and provocative David Webb Peoples scenario, describes a terrifying vision of a near future, dark and cold, while maintaining a steady pace and a hard, hard tone throughout. In addition, Anderson manages the moving moments of humanity (Todd's struggle to come into contact with his previously suppressed feelings is truly poignant) and stages the moving action scenes with a heartbreaking gusto. Russell gives a strong and impressive portrait of Todd almost pantomime; he transmits a lot of emotion without saying much and acts rather through his body movements and his facial expressions. Jason Scott Lee as brutal rival Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute boy Nathan, Gary Busey as veteran from Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the merry Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as the sensitive Mayor Hawkins. Better still, this film makes a deep and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of being a ruthless soldier and about the importance of intellectual force on physical power. David Tattersall's sophisticated cinematography, Joel McNeely's catchy orchestral score, and world-class special effects further enhance the exceptional quality of this hybrid hybrid of high-quality science fiction and action.
