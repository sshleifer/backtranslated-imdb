I admit that I did not know what to expect before viewing this very stylized piece. It could have been the cure for the zombie virus or the cold, as far as I know. It started with beautiful graphics, small snippets to catch your eye and give free rein to your imagination. As I went, I quickly learned by voice what was going on. A nice little neo-black story that, in my opinion, was not up to a few minutes of my time. The small clues given to the audience through visual elements at first give it a sense of accomplishment as they bring together the plot. With a nice twist in the end it's a cool package. The score, though not bad, gives the film an almost musical feel. I just felt a little outdated, without adding anything to advance the scenario. Some of the performances were too dramatic but perfectly matched the feel of the room as a whole. I am very satisfied. I was given a lot of information in a short time, but thanks to excellent editing and dubbing, I did not feel rushed. Good work!
