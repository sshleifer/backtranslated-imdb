Atlantis is probably the best Disney movie I've seen in years. He has a big action scene, magic, a smart script written and done well. Atlantis, brings back the magic of Disney classics such as "The Lion King" or "Alladin". After seeing this one, I'm sure the summer blockbuster season will be beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to all "," Alantis: The Lost Empire is like a breath of inspiration. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
