Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better film than I thought. I never thought that this movie would meet my expectations. While this film started slowly, but as the film went on, it became more to my taste. The story takes place in 1914 and speaks of a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the legendary Atlantis. With his grandfather's friends, he embarks on an incredible adventure. Along the way, he must love friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The voice is great. They surely know how to transport movies only with their vocal talent. The music is nothing special but anyway nice. The animation is not the best, but it is sufficient. All in all, it's a good family movie for all ages. I note this film 9/10.
