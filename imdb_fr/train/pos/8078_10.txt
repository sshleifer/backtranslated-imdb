Even though it was a box office disaster, it's my favorite movie. This gives a powerful family message. There is a lot of violence and a song with a group of girls in bikinis. Compared to other Bollywood movies, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It's an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian godfather, Amitabh describes it in this film. Do not read critics of critics, they are simply ignorant. This film has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So, if you want to see a more realistic action than Main Hoon Na (good movie), this is the movie.
