One night, I got up late at night to watch the cable channels and watch this movie about 10 minutes after the start. Whenever I even imagined going to bed, something told me to keep looking at him even though it was far from bedtime. <br /> <br /> This film could have been an easy anti-weapon film, but they preferred to examine the aftermath of the shooting. And even better, the film continued in real life - just when you think they will take the easiest and most artificial way possible, a change will occur and change the perspective of the film. Not only does this film not follow the formula, it shows how other events lead and / or affect thereafter. <br /> <br /> I only wish that the filmmakers have explored the problems related to antidepressants. plus - the Columnbine kids who did the shooting were on them for years and it was scary to see how Deanna broke them every time the nightmares started. Until recently, they were distributing tricks like sweets and only now are they beginning to understand the long-term effects of medications. It was very refreshing to see that the aspect of mental illness in history was pretty filmed, with a parent who was suffering from a mental illness, I can say that the movie was crazy in all aspects of mental illness . Congratulations to the director and screenwriter who has obviously done his homework on these issues. And for those who think that some things could not happen in a hospital (I do not want to say more), you're absolutely wrong, I went there. The scenario was so real that it was incredible. <br /> <br /> Go BUY this movie and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late. One day, they will thank you.
