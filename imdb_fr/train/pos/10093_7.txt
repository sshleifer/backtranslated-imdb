A beautiful shop girl in London is swept away by a millionaire owner in a tea plantation and soon finds herself married and lives with him in her villa in British Ceylon. Although based on the book by Robert Standish, this initial configuration is strongly reminiscent of that of "Rebecca" Hitchock. The main woman, Elizabeth Taylor, was confronted by the imposing Chief of Staff of the manor and (almost immediately) her own husband, still under the thumb of his deceased father but dominant. Taylor, a last-minute replacement for a sick Vivien Leigh, looks very smooth in her couture wardrobe and her performance is pretty strong. However, once the husband Peter Finch started drinking a lot and barking orders, one would think that his dedication to him was rather masochistic (this feeling also hinders the end). Nevertheless, the film is a real pleasure for soap buffs: romantic drama, travel story, interpretative dance, elephant stampede and cholera outbreak at the right time! *** of ****
