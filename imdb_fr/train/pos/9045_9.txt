There are a few small stories on a scene in the movie where Homer attended the December 6, 1957 attempt (at least it was the video used on the television he was watching) that showed Vangard's attempt to launch, who failed. <br /> <br /> He is then shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun expressing his condolences for the failure. <br /> <br /> Von Braun was at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, working for the military. The Vanguard project was the work of the first NASA team, which became what would become the Goddard Space flight center. <br /> <br /> The army rushed on the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US-made V2 technology, but satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This mistake may have been made by Homer, because of Von Braun's notoriety, but his attempt has not failed. In fact, the underlying Redstone was flying at age 52 and was the first US recall, used for Shepard's sub-orbital flight, as well as Grissom's. <br /> <br /> That's why this type of movie is so good, we hope it will inspire people to read and spot these stories and, in doing so, to see what has been done and to be instigated to do more.
