This film attracts you from the beginning because it catches our attention recognizing, yes, that this story begins with a cliché? a burial. <br /> <br /> In hands other than Judi's, I would not have given it an 8, this material having been repeated over and over again: the big meeting of a famous man, choose one , Army Squad, Theater Group, Singers, Group. <br /> <br /> But this film never stops at the cheap sentimentalization, and when you think it's going to get lost, it goes in another direction. Flowers sent by an admirer to Judi are a typical example. <br /> <br /> The members of the group form an interesting group that also passes over clichés. We are in prison, we have found religion, we are an alkie and we have fallen into madness. But the joy of life found by Judi, aroused by the interest of her granddaughter, takes us away and makes us forget the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> The cast is one who is talented, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with his astonishing high notes, a final performance of Joan Sims, brave Joan, a pretty model like a button, Ian Holm swaying, and Olympia Dukakis as an energetic divorcee living in the Scottish highlands with her ghillie and her whiskey, The closing scene is that of the Hollywood fare, the judged children of the star converted into passionate fans of fun old lovers together, young people trained in their music. Life should be so simple. But I would watch it again and I would hear it with my own granddaughter. Because, in good hands, we sometimes like these old brazen clichés. 8 out of 10
