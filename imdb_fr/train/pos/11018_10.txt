This film is really challenging for Cliffhangin's movie! Stallone was good as always! Michael Rooker presented a surprising performance and John Lithgow played a great villain! The music is fantastic, especially the theme! The film is full of action and never dull! a fan of Stallone then look at Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
