If you do not like this movie, either your dead or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent distribution, which has all given good performances. This film proves that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite the critics. Adam Sandler is becoming a highly respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, then he made some bad movies, then he broke through with a fantastic performance in the first 50 dates, The Longest Yard, then Click and now Reign Over Me. <br /> > Back to the film Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest to his family are his stepmother and stepfather. After his old college friend (Cheadle) met him, he seems to be changing his life. I will not say more, because I do not want to ruin the film, but I highly recommend it. One of the best movies of 2007.
