This show is great. I thought the two episodes Paul died of were so sad; I actually cried. But the other shows were great; Kerry was my favorite character because she was in the "dark side". I also thought Bridget was funny because she was so happy. I also thought that the guy who played Kyle was really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. All this TV show is fun and I wish they would still show it on TV. when they showed it on television, I watched it every time. The next time it shows, I'll watch it again and again.
