Remember the beginnings of pay per view? Yes, and I almost remember the number you had to call to rent the movie on your TV. As a child, we always wanted to rent a playboy, but that meant calling someone from PPV and asking him to rent it. And then you get the courage to do it and your four-hour soft base observation without corner crap. The reason I'm talking about it is that this film was also in ppv. And I remember almost every scene that was in the addition. In recent years, I have been keen to get all the great movies I used to see when I was a kid and that was one of them. It is the one who has trouble going out. All the stars of the cast are trying to commit the perfect banking bankruptcy, but nothing is going well.
