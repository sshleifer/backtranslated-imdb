I'm glad other people enjoyed this movie because I know he does not have the best reputation and he did not make any money at the box office. I thought it was great and there are many reasons why - Bogdanovich achieves with the slightest touch, the cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple has never been so beautiful on film. You have seen worse movies!
