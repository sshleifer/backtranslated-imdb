I would give it almost 10 out of 10. However, there are confusing parts as well as missing sections that hinder the unfolding / continuity of the film. The scenario is great and well composed. you will certainly want to look at it quietly to understand it. The characters are complicated, as well as the story, expect you to be given enough information to stop scratching your head, it's a movie where everything is explained at the end. The animation is excellent and the combination of femme fatale and film noir gives an excellent film that does not look like anything I saw in the animation. It's a black and white film and it's dark in some scenes, so it's worth watching on a good T.V, or plasma. The voices of the characters record this film in its English version, but it would have been more convincing if there were French accents to emphasize that it is Paris, I appreciated it more in French with English subtitles. It's worth buying a DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And personally, if you enjoyed this movie, you might also like it; Waking the life and ghosts of Shell Innocence 2, this is just a personal suggestion.
