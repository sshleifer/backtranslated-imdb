Dragon Hunters must be the best animated movie I have ever seen. It was amazing. The film tells the story of a pair of money-hungry thieves, their strange blue fur-fired dog firing, and a girl who dreams of becoming a knight. They are then sent on a quest to go to the end of the earth gobbler world, an incredibly huge dragon. But honestly, it does not matter the subject of the film. Because it's absolutely beautiful. Gravity in this fantastic world is different, so architectural blocks and spheres of earth float amidst cathedrals and castles and villages, as well as floating water lily forests. The world is so creative, so beautiful, with some kind of silent storybook. The world looks like a set of beautiful paintings. The monsters are also breathtaking, like a fire dragon made up of a swarm of evil bats. Part of the plot is not too original, as the main protagonists who want to have their farm both with mice and men and who never seem to be able to succeed in the world; but the beautiful graphics, some seriously sinister scenes and a dialogue evocative of emotions make this film spectacular.
