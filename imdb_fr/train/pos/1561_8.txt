I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (even if he was just swimming) made me open my eyes. What I expected was to see most of the founders of the Justice League trying to bring down Lex Luthor. It sounds a bit off topic, but doing a live broadcast of the Justice League would certainly give me a reason to reject everything I usually do during the week, just to watch an episode. It's the thrill I had while watching this episode. I would have liked this episode to be a little longer, like a two-hour special, because I thought that one hour of the Justice League was not enough. Now, before you get bored (unless I already do it with my hikes), I just want to say, Smallville is cool again. He lost touch when the show started focusing on Lana. But I'm sure the editors will just fall into this loop hole. :( So take advantage of this episode Who knows when another good will come out.Catch it again this Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first broadcast.
