In fact, I am outraged by the comment I read, that this film was "boring" and that the beautiful landscape was troubled by the black and white images. It was manufactured in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely amazing for the moment! <br /> <br /> The journey of these people is quite remarkable. It took them a week to cross a river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs, climbing a solid stone, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I would like to see everyone doing this now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a beautiful movie with really incredible shots and an incredible story.
