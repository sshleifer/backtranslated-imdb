OK, here is my personal list of today's best Nicktoons shows: <br /> <br /> 1. All Square / SpongeBob Square Pants <br /> <br /> 2. My robot teen life < br /> <br /> 3. Zim Invader <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Razmokets <br /> <br /> You notice a word composed only of capital letters? That means it's the Nick show I'm going to talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is essentially a simple but brilliant animated comedy about three wealthy cats - Mr. Blik, Gordon and Waffles - who get in strange and REALLY surreal situations, since the attempt to attend the Human Kimberely's pajama party to take a non-alcoholic beer to save a slug planet from the evil spaceship. This is a Nick show that will allow you to tickle your funny bone sooner or later! The theme song is catchy and memorable. The voice actors - including Wayne Knight of the "Seinfield" franchise - give the characters a new life with very original personalities. The stories are nice (the episodes of the fans would be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And the humor is all done in a certain style of Earthworm Jim. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Catscratch" is part of the Nicktoons series, like "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which becomes very, very popular around the world in 3 seasons or less.
