Home Room was a good movie if you have ever had a drama in your life. It makes you want to see more. You wonder what the secret Alicia hides. I think I watched this film 6 times in a row and that I never lost interest. Also, I do not usually cry for movies, but this one made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like this one. Overall, I thought it was a good movie. The more you look at it, the more you are part of it. The end is the part that really got me when she cried when she graduated, because there was the name of her daughter. I felt like my heart was broken at that moment. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she had not yet had hers. I liked it so much.
