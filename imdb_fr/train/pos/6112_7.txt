It's primarily a girls movie, it's a romantic comedy. There is a balance between the two. This particular movie has added some rather sweet fight scenes. I do not think wires were used or if they were really obvious. This is not a terribly complicated movie, so the brain is easy, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, simple enough, good chemistry between tracks and a fun watch. I would like girls to have all the potential of girls to be incredibly cute, but throughout the film, they remain discreet. I'll watch it again ... with a girl.
