I love this movie, but I can not have what's in this movie, it's not like it. Those who do not like this film should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe that Mr. Carrey is hiding behind all that makeup. And I'm sure most actors and actresses have already filmed. And there is a new face in the film. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. At the opening, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And cause some fun for those who are in Whoville. We know those who love Christmas While The Grinch does not like Christmas. And even mocks little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), daughter of the postmaster of the city (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is appointed mayor of Whoville. Who does not like to talk about Grinch as Christmas approaches?
