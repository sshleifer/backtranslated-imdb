I gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors AND my god enging it! The thing is, I do not want to say anything to any actor or story, because it would ruin the movie. But I will recommend that you go immediately to your nearest mover and rent it! (Do not forget the popcorn!)
