When I saw the DVD box developed for this and the terrible Red Queen figure, I was certain that I was going to have a big disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. A nonsense that is complicated, of course, and unforgivable, that such a complicated ending is precipitated to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles, much less to absorb the ridiculous explanation. Apart from that, the film is a dream. Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in beautiful frames and all in constant motion and accompanied by a magnificent score of Bruno Nicolai. It may not be Morricone, but in these lighter parts, it could just as well be. Really nice with lots of colors, lots of sexy, bloody killings and minimal police intervention. Great.
