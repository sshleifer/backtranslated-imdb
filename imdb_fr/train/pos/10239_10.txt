I do not agree with those who did not like this film. <br /> <br /> I loved this film when I was little and I still love it. It's sweet, funny and warms your heart. And that proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And even if he did not have a lot of history, it was always excellent, I give him a 10 and two inches. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, it shows that your deepest dreams can come true. (Tears, tears) <br /> <br /> I like this movie, personally, if someone says it's bad, I'll say "Shame on you." Because it was a delicious little movie and I'm happy that at least SOME people liked it.
