I really liked this movie, just like the audience I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the movie, many people were crying and saying how much the movie had affected them. I can understand why he was so successful in his homeland, Sweden. The film is flawlessly directed and each character is brilliantly drawn so that at the end you really know and care about those people. The music is very natural and the main song of the film is heartbreaking but inspiring. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, even those who do not use subtitled movies. The Oscar nomination certainly deserved because of the film's profound themes reflected unpretentious in a community of a small town with ordinary people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. A MUST SEE!
