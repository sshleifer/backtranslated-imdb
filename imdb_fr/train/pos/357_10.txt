The film is extremely enjoyable with excellent distribution and excellent staging by James Eves. The film is entertaining with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and everyone is perfectly screened. James Eves has a good eye for the cast and directs as a conductor knowing exactly when to ride the action, then fall and reach a climax. He does it with an element of humor, full of twists, thrills and blood. It's a return of the old vampire movie, with a lot of composure and shouting. The film runs at a great speed and the characters take you on a great adventure, but what makes it so good is that the movie does not take itself too seriously, with a lot of action in the cheek.
