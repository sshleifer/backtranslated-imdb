It's superb - the game of wonderful actors, sets, clothes, music - but especially the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed that there are not more critics of this film - certainly one of the best of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> It's also a wonderful movie to see in association with the big "Random Harvest", which has about the same opening crisis <br /> <br /> - an unknown and middle-aged English WWI The officer is in a hospital towards the end of the war, suffering shock and total amnesia with no idea of ​​his name, his origin or wherever he is - he turns out to be a very rich and well-established man - when he " recovers, "I will not remember the years before the war - <br /> <br /> But the similarities between the films come to an end. <br /> <br /> My warmest thanks to all those who participated in the film - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a great and surprising casting choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This one stays with you forever.
