All in all, the movie was pretty good, a good action plan with lots of explosions and fight scenes, but Chuck Norris did practically nothing, apart from disarming the bomb and shooting a few characters. The film was very much like the events of September 11th. A "ben laden" terrorist sent a video to the president (Urich) and threatened to blow it up. Judson Mills had some great acting roles, eliminating Rashid's compound and various kick-bot roles, but Chuck Norris was missing. Judson took the main part of the action, leaving Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But all in all, it was realistic and the action was not lacking, she did it only from Mr. Norris. I gave the movie 7/10.
