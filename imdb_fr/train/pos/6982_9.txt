Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic story is that humanity is at a crossroads. There is a set of moral dilemmas we face. Humanity has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is humanity mature enough to cope with its new toys? There is a moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to attract attention. I predict (based on BSG) that there will be a problem with the Cylons and slavery. On top of that, there are all the other problems that we humans pose to us. <br /> <br /> This show is not from the BSG - at least not to the extent that humanity is on the run from a ruthless problem ultimately of their own making. There are also not many shoot-em-up or space effects - at least not in the first episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> It contains very good stories, characters and themes. He also has good performances of the actors. They can create a culture that resembles modern society, but at the same time is totally believable. Like BSG, this show deals with humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and weaknesses. It may seem a little strange that a human society in a different world has ties, vintage cars and chicken. But these things are really more for creating a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone who is stuck on these details really misses the point. Whether you belong to a mafia-style culture or a high-tech high-tech culture, man and human nature are not so different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see in the world today. I wonder if writers are trying to tell us anything.
