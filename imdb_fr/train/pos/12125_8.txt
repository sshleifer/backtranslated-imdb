I saw this film again and found how close it was to the novel if we did not know about Cary's childhood part [Leslie Howard]. Considering that <br /> <br /> at the time, we can not show much on the screen, [even if there is not much in the novel], the obsession of the character of Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well transmitted to the public. . I recommend this movie to anyone who has already fallen in love with another person and the other party has tried to take advantage of it. I read that Maugham was asked to record the novel for sale, but when he started working in the studio, he started crying and could not finish more than a few lines and the entire project was thrown away. We can say that the novel is written from the bottom of the heart and that the film is a good <br /> <br /> adaptation of at least part of it.
