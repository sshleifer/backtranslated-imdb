Go people, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie last Saturday. This is a gorgeous movie monster cheese with a hilarious acting game and two stupid stupid stupid that add to the schlock factor. The two guys in redneck boat rental make the movie! LOL, and you'll love the boat scene where the English guy and his wife talk about all the stars and it's sunny noon. Bloody hilarious !!! You can tell they were making fun of the plot, they just wanted to get through the movie as quickly as possible. In the end, you'll love it if you like the 70's schlock.
