Another fantastic film from a country where, due to decades of oppression by fundamentalist regimes, it is easy to create an exciting subject. Panahi takes a different approach this time with a mixture of ironic comedy and endearing and unprofessional distribution. While spreading his message about what he considers to be fundamentally wrong with his country, he does so without the need for a complicated scenario. It is a positive vision of a country, especially its people, which the Iranian population desperately needs. The biggest damage is that it is not broadcast in the country. The Iranian, island and paranoid government says the filmmaker is only successful abroad because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. After growing up in the middle of the revolution and seeing academics, artists, and educated people "disappear" over the last 25 years, he has shown great courage in continuing to spread his work. The realism obtained by pulling on the World Cup qualifier really transports you to the event. The fact that he shot in 35mm is incredible, because most of them would only try this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on using only non-professional actors also really works in this movie. Beautiful performances all around. After watching many movies showing the problems faced by Iran and the media reporting the facts, we may have a tendency to demonize the people and the government. This film does the opposite. This shows us that they still love the same things and that, by making fun of themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law, a change for the better is perhaps not so far away. Some call Panahi a feminist director, but I think he is fighting for the most oppressed demographic in Iran. Young independent women.
