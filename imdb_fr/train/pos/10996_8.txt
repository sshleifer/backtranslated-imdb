Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be insane. This woman is incredibly beautiful and a talented actress. It's a difficult combination to find now days. And Jeremy Northam. I have heard his name many times, but I have never really noticed it. My advice in Hollywood is: "use it more". <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie: I watched it in one of my cemetery reports. I do not recommend it to anyone. It's a little complicated and mysterious for that. I still can not believe I did not see the end come. I will not say why it would spoil the hole film. Although to say that this is enough to spoil. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm supposed to vote for this movie. I love mystical dark history, the actors did a good job and I love the work of director (natali) in the past. There is not much public for this kind of thing, it's also quite risky. you know what, I'm just going to give this job an 8 because everyone should see that. Again, a deduction of 1 point because there is always room for improvement.
