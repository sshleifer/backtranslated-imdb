The flapping of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can trigger a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow linked to the theory of chaos, I do not exactly know how), every action, no matter how insignificant, will trigger a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This gem of a movie shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect everyone's life. (The six degrees of separation theory can also be applied.) Each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film. The actors' game is finely tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is luminous), the stories are plausibly intertwined, the humor is right, and the viewer lets the theater acquiesce.
