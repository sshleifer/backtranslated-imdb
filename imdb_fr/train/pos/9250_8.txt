Clark Gable plays the role of a crook who interferes in the life of Jean Harlow, the hard-boiled lady. He tries to suck her while she removes her hard attitude. Despite their cynicism and inconvenience, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during an attack, he runs out, leaving Harlow in the women's prison where she discovers she is pregnant. The writings of Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers are excellent with many well-designed and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist detainee, a black inmate and her father preacher played with barely a trace of stereotype). Gable and Harlow show their courage as actors by adding revealing nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. And the direction is much better than what you expect from Sam Wood. Harlow was enthroned in the prison with a beautiful shot and then headed into a surprisingly snowy backyard as the camera followed her. This is one of the best kinds of "love criminals" and "women's prison" and one of the best hard-hitting dialogues ever written.
