I remember coming across this special in 1965. I had never heard of Barbra. At the end of the series, I thought, "It's probably the best thing I'll ever see on TV." 42 years later, this is true. There is still nothing as surprising, honestly as amazing as the talent that has manifested itself here. You can talk about all the super stars you want, it's the most superlative of all! <br /> <br /> You call her, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sensual seduction, ballads, Barbra is really a storyteller. Her ability to succeed whatever she tries is legendary. But this special was done at the beginning and helped to create the legend that it quickly became. Despite her ascent in such a short time, she kept her promise, revealing her talents over the years. But they are all here from the beginning. You will not be disappointed to see this.
