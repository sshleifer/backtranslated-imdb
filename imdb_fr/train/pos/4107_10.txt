I loved this film! It's really weird, extremely funny, morbid, spiritual ... It makes no sense to tell the content of the film because I would give the result! You must see it without knowing what it is! Everything is connected and has its cause and its cause. Everything starts subtly, then things start to roll faster and faster until they end in the most senseless explosion you can imagine! It's even more fun to watch the movie a second time, once you know all the "stuff". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a true masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
