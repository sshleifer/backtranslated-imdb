Page 3 is most certainly a captivating and captivating revelation that very intelligently exposes the hypocritical lifestyles of the Mumbai elite. From fake kisses to frizzy smiles, there is nothing to suggest the shocking lives of the rich and the famous. Backlash, gossip, corruption and scandal hide in every dark corner of the world of pomp and glamor. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality. Everybody is constantly looking for more money, fame and a better reputation, which drives them to do the most shameful things, from signing filming contracts to funerals to child abuse. Everything is possible in this metropolis where the gap between social classes is so great. The public sees the ugliness of these two classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She observes the suffocating atmosphere and hallucinatory frenzy in which socialites live. Bollywood, business magnates, politicians and the underground world are all involved in a completely complicated mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a beautiful track as the Kuan Hand Doob Jaongi. Great movie with great character development!
