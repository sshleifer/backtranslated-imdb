Dana Andrews is one of those actors I've probably seen in a dozen movies, but never really registered for me. Often frozen, taciturn, playing the same kind of roles and looking a bit like Glenn Ford, who is also underrated, he is an actor who needs some effort to truly appreciate; but once you hit the right movie .... <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's sullen look on New York's belly is as dirty and fishy as any 50s black, and Andrews is in his element like a tough policeman, Mark Dixon, who does not know how to play the game for go ahead: he hates criminals too much to always abide by the rules. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally kills the witness of a murder involving an illegal bullshit game set up by a gangster that Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to hide his involvement and to bring before him. his kind of "justice". Along the way, he gets in touch with the wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and must also try to convince his father to murder him. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography by Joseph LaShelle, with Ben Hecht's hard and sparkling dialogue and a really powerful ending with elements of tragedy and a grace found in a minute or two, it's a new black for ages and could well be my favorite Preminger movie to date - it's just as good as the most advertised Laura.
