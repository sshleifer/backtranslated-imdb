Originally, I had seen this film a few years ago at Cinemax Friday, after a black series (at the time when the decoder was built like a keyboard), and it intrigued me. The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very pleasant. They have good chemistry together and Miou-Miou gives a breath-taking pink fur. A film like this would probably not be done in these politically correct times (at least not in the US) because it seems to be sensationalizing things like violence, theft, and occasional sex. This film proves that with talented and talented talent, making a good movie is a good movie, no matter what. It saddens me to discover that Patrick Dewaere committed suicide and that in the near future I will check with Depardieu & Miou. -Myou in Take out your handkerchief.
