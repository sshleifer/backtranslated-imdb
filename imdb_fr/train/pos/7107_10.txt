You can call it a mystery, maybe a little thriller or a smart movie. <br /> <br /> The story describes the life of a person who has lost his life and seeks to find it. <BR/> <br /> I must say that I was quite surprised to have really enjoyed this movie. This is not usually the genre that is important to me, but the characters quickly became characters for me and I wanted to know what they were talking about and what was going to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Like many French films on English We can learn a lot more about the character and impact of their environment on their person. This movie is character-driven and will not disappoint you!
