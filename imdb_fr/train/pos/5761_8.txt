I swear this zombie was killed twice and kept coming back. I gave this film the note 8. Let's face it, that's exactly what other critics say, that is, a film shot "handy". Hey, hey, hey, welcome to making independent movies. The fact that Todd Sheets has made more than 700 zombies appear in this film is a tribute to his talents. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and bloody horror movie, to share with your buds or to blur the people who really matter to you, LOL. Dear friends, I guess you all liked rubbish like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead. Peace and support to independent cinema !!!
