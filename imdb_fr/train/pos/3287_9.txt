My friend and I chose "Paperhouse" in a pile of random movies on our weekly Horror tour - none of us had heard of it, but the box text was really promising. And the movie did not disappoint, although I probably would not call it a horror movie yet. <br /> <br /> Anna Madden, 11, draws a house and visits it in her dreams. She really sleeps when she sees the house, but it's so real that it's almost like a completely separate reality. Which, in view of subsequent events, does not seem very far from the truth. Anyway, she finds that she can add to the house, its content and its environment by simply adding an image. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anna is getting sick of fever and moreover, she is totally obsessed with the house and her drawing. On top of that, she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father. he has a job that takes him for long periods of time, although one has the impression that the story is richer than this one. <br /> <br /> OK, the drawing looks good, but frankly, there is something really. threatening about it. The dream world is strangely surreal - the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of a desolate field. The people who made the film were very good at making us very uncomfortable with this alternative world / this dream ... <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient as his doctor does not stop talking (I do not hide that from you, you know from the moment it appears that it is the same child). In reality, Mark can not walk because of illness. In Anna's drawing world, he can not walk because she did not pull his legs. She blames herself for her real illness and tries to remedy the situation, but ... everything starts to get really weird. She even brings her absent father to the drawing, with disastrous results. The words with the father are really terrifying. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything away, so I'll stop there ... There seems to be a lot of things in this movie. I'm sure you'll have fun analyzing this thing and you'll die with your friends after watching it - is it just a story, or are there really multiple levels of meaning? I do not know, but anyway it's pretty fascinating. There was a quality "Nightmare On Elm Street" about it, to the extent that at some point reality and dreams intersect. I love things like this. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that we have the impression that it could have ended several times, but it is not the case. I'm happy with the end he has had (some of you sensitive types may want to have Kleenex at your fingertips!), Although he may actually be coming to some conclusions. Anyway, it's not really stretched once it's over, but while you're watching and the display keeps coming back, it's a little scary. <br /> <br /> Yet, "Paperhouse" is really a good movie. It's well done and the role - especially Charlotte Burke as Anna- - is first rate. Burke, who has never been in a film before, is a real gem. I do not know why she never did anything else, but anyway, she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not really a horror movie, it's a kind of fantasy / suspense / other kind of movie, with some awful moments - but you can still watch it with your family and not be afraid that your little brother or grandmother will be killed by splashes of blood or something like that. <br /> <br /> Indulge yourself, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read the book too ...
