After seeing this movie on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I do not see a better way to spend a lazy Friday night than to put my pennies on. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments about it. Does every film, good or bad, deserve no more than four comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when watching a movie like April Love is to remind you of its time, in this case that of the late fifties. The films were pretty much a happy medium at the time. The cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with large-screen Technicolor films to keep viewers away from the gray light of the evil medium in a box called television. I do not know how many people were scammed from the tube to see this one, but this one caught my attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager. Sent live with her aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and her uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car. It seems that her aunt and uncle lost their own son (Jed Jr.). Uncle Jed seems to have lost his joie de vivre. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick will be at the farm to get Jed out of his slump. Stories like this being what they are, Jed and Nick are not really interested of course, of course. Jed then meets the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Immediately, Jed has a crush on Fran, and of course I do not have to tell you that Liz has a crush on Jed. Then there is the problem of Uncle Jed's horse, a trotter gone mad and who will not let anyone manipulate him since Jed Jr.'s death. You could probably explain to yourself what's going on from that moment on. the. no real surprises. It does not matter, you'll have fun anyway. <br /> <br /> Once you have overcome the image of Pat Boone, who is clean and creaky, as a bad boy, you will have no problem with the rest of the list. movie. Given this, Boone performs a surprisingly good performance as Nick. While the role does not require much depth, it's still a job well done when you least expect it. As a Jed, Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the role. At first he is inaccessible and cold, but as he slowly warms up to Nick, we see he's really a very good guy. Jeannette Nolan is very entertaining with Henrietta, who constantly plays the role of mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and has some opportunities to do it through her singing skills. As Liz, she is beautiful to watch, great to listen to and quite funny sometimes. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a bit wilder, is also entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is no nasty and mean character on the screen. . Not a real bad guy in all this. Everyone is so nice that you can not help but enjoy the movie. In truth, I find it very refreshing, much like leaving your problems behind and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a little more conspiracy and a Technicolor widescreen. The songs are a mix, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing that really appealed to me was that they did not use the blue screen background during the horse racing sequences, and that they were much more fun and exciting to because of that. In fact, you will find the whole movie beautifully photographed and it was nice to see that they did not skimp on this department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all is how disgust between Nick and Jed is portrayed as everyone tries to earn respect from others. <br /> <br /> This film will never be confused with the big cinema. Still, sometimes, instead of going to Disneyland, you just need a nice outing in the park, and that's what Love Love is. <br /> <br /> My note: B + <br /> <br />
