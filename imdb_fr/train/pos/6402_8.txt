I thought this move was very good. There were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall, I was pretty surprised. In the end, the courtroom seemed a little unrealistic, but it was real enough to be entertaining. I found that the film communicated the difficulties of following military training and the sacrifices that ensue. As a military pilot, I could understand many of these areas.
