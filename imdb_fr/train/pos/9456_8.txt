Unlike many other films, which are disturbing because of their naked annoyance (Man Bites Dog) or their pure violence (most of Peckinpah's films), Deliverance is shocked by its plausibility. While the scene of sodomy is quite simple in its annoyance, the effect of the film stems much more from its slowness and the real sense of isolation that surrounds the four main roles, both before and after everything starts to go through. The moment when canoes pass under the child on deck, who does not even recognize the men with whom he had played before, shows no sign of human affection towards them, is one of the most sinister of modern cinema . The tension steadily increases throughout the canoe trip and perseveres even after the final credits - the end makes the significance of the characters' trials terribly real. The plausibility of the film is greatly facilitated by the play of the main actors, especially Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as a reluctant victim and hero, respectively. Burt Reynolds has never been better. The cultural influence of the film is demonstrated by the number of people who will understand a reference to "banjo territory" - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective job against a region's tourism industry. I can only think of a handful of movies that have plunged me into such a serious depression after finishing - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although excellent in itself, Deliverance is a classic because there is no adequate point of comparison. It is unique.
