A very good start. I was a little surprised to find that the machine was not as advanced: it should have been coarser, like the original series. The cast is interesting, although the lady Vulkan seems a little too human. She needs school on Spock who, after all, is the model for this race. Too bad they could not choose Jeri Ryan. I like Mrs. Park, the Korean lady (?). The doctor has possibilities. I did not sort other men except black. He is really nice. Bakula needs to find his place - At QL, his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He is, of course, tall and strong enough for exploits. The heavyweights were OK, even though I did not like their makeup.
