It's a nice little horror movie that independent movie fans will really enjoy. He has a good acting, a lot of gore and a decent plot. We will remember movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is obvious that the budget was not that important, but the film really makes up for it with an atmosphere and strong performance from the actors, which seems to be lacking in many of today's big-screen special effects. The film is really moving forward and there is excellent direction and good camera work. There are no lost scenes, so the duration of the movie is a bit short. In addition, it seems that the end leaves an opening for a sequel, which would also be very interesting. Take some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy.
