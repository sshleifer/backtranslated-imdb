*** 1/2 of ***** Although I am not concerned that this is a dubbed version in English, as some critics have mentioned, it should be noted, because it seems to reside in many native hearts of Quebeckers. However, it was a children's movie of which I was a fervent admirer; keeping in mind now that it has been designed for children, I evaluate this ranking on a relative basis. The story goes that children during the winter holidays build an imposing snow fort and jostle for control by means of weapons such as snowballs and other nonsense, such as hands-free and free time equal to winter vacation lessons. If I had children, it's definitely a film that I would like to try to interest them, because the strong snow seduced me when I was young, and I think that even children today would be okay, though with Pixar and all the computer animation. I am obsolete and I do not realize it. In addition, the film's message is both wonderfully allegorical and positive, both for children (and adults).
