... and I really think so. If not literally (after all, I have not seen all the movies ever created!), At least, of course, among those I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The basic rule with IMDb is this: sometimes the movies are rated very well (for example, the Kannes-Kompetition-Krown-Korean-Kraap song called "Oldboy") can be really bad. But rarely a film worth watching is actually less than 6. This film is really worth watching. A shame. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I give him a 10 in protest. The film is not perfect. His real note should be an 8 or a 9. He has some actor defects (Belafonte in particular), the script sometimes wanders. However, here we have one of the greatest directors of all time, the Czech Jan Kadar, who directs two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved Zero Mostel, larger than life, and the sublime Ida Kaminska in a role / poetic / moral tour de force. A pair made in paradise! It is true that this film, small in itself, will not appeal to the average audience, but to all those who wish to watch an excellent film (without being beyond criticism) of the incomparable director who offered us "The shop from the main street ". (The best Holocaust film of all time) should not miss this simply because a stupid IMDb rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> This is not the case.
