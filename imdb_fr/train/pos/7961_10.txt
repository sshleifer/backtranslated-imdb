"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about pets. Deserves its place among the great films of this genre and even in the world of cinema in general, alongside other animal films such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". That means it's more than a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Can this be just a "remake"? It's too good to be a remake! I have known her by heart since I was a teenager (at the age of 12). <br /> <br /> It's a family film to cherish. It's emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, comforting and sometimes dramatic. This is one of those films that makes fans of this type of film smile. <br /> <br /> This film does not lack qualities. It has a thoughtful history, pleasant characters, an excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling landscapes / landscapes of the magnificent Sierra Mountains (in Oregon). Speaking of panoramas, it's not just mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... In conclusion, all the wonders of nature in a pure state - a real panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are friendly, well developed and well represented by the respective actors. Robert Hays is great as a generous dad, Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is good like Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is as good as Hope. Kevin Chevalia is conventional as younger brother and cute Jamie (his appearance reminds me a lot Kevin Corcoran in "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is great like Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> When it comes to our quadruped pals, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is the faithful old Golden Retriever, wise, mature, handsome, caring and loving (brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche). Chance, the American bulldog, is the opposite of Shadow. He is careless, silly, impatient, worried, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (voiced by the talented Michael J. Fox). Luck can not stand still. Sassy is the quintessence of the cat's image: elegant, independent, very confident and proud of himself, with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm. Sassy is a Seal Point Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful breeds of cats. Sally is the voice of Sally Field, who is also doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are themselves excellent "actors": Ben for Shadow, Rattler for Chance and Tiki for Sassy. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film, but a classic in its own right. His suite is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on Top 250.
