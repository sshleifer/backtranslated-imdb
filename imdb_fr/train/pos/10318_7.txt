It has been said that The Movies and Baseball both prospered during the Great Depression. It seems that the sad realities of a nation taken in the aftermath of this economic disaster have created a need for occasional relief for the population. A temporary getaway could be found in the soap opera at Baseball. <br /> <br /> Similarly, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours in the darkened auditoriums of the Cinema. The presence of a radio in virtually everyone has allowed Depression Era America to become familiar with world events and to offer many dramatic and (especially) comical performances for a pleasant interlude of the harsh reality. <br /> <br /> The literature of the time has also flourished at all levels. Juvenile reading habits have contributed to the creation of comics as we know them, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the comic did not appear as if by magic, all fully developed with all the colorful pages in 4 colors, all alone. There were mediums that were ancestral to them. Clearly, the comic strip Newspaper was one of the parents, providing the visual / narrative method of telling stories. <br /> <br /> The other direct ancestor was Pulp Magazine. The inexpensive publications of prose stories that contained many stories of the same characters in adventures in current stories, although not necessarily serialized. The paper base has been around for decades and introduced us to TARZAN by Edgar Rice Borrough and ZORRO by Johnston McCulley. The 1930s gave birth to an exceptional harvest: characters such as THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, BATTLE ACES of the G8 and THE SPIDER, THE MASTER OF MEN, all found their way to newsstands, among others. <br /> <br /> was DOC SAVAGE, a super hero of written history; the covers of the pulps may have been the only "image" of the hero. Possessing extraordinary strength, super-bright senses and genius-minded intellect, Doc was the prototype of the superhero. <br /> <br /> He also gathered five of his former army friends into a small team of free adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a given field. So we had the best results: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, and so on. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage's stories were very popular in the 1930s and 1940s and were published. in the mid-50s. Then they took a break from 12 to 15 years. Then, the brainstorming was undertaken to repackage the old novels in a new "container", the paperback. The cover was introduced with a very stylized series of paintings of a very muscular Doc, with a shirt torn in perpetuity. <br /> <br /> The reintroduction was very successful. of one title per month (and for a moment more). Soon, there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie! But when, by what producer? Well, the venerable "Bronze Man" was back in the media for more than 10 years before any real project was set up. Geoprge Pal, veteran of stop-action animation and leading special effects film producer, directed the film alongside Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE, BRONZE MAN arrived in cinemas, he bragged about a cast-iron cast of actors, even though it's largely "nameless" with respect to the familiarity with viewers. With former TV Tarzan, Ron Ely is an almost perfect cast at the top of Starlette's emerging beauty, Pamela Hensley in the lead and veteran character of Paul Wexler (in the role of villain, Captain Seas); no other name would have been recognized. And, maybe it was an added advantage in this case. <br /> <br /> The story succeeds very well in making the incredible group known to the majority of the spectators while preparing a plot. The use of narration by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method used to move the introduction into the main body of the story. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, there are clues that this story will go with the same kind of "Camp" made humor as the Batman TV series. Paul Frees' narration and the unexpected and improbable results throw a sense of humor into some very successful first scenes featuring Doc and the entire team. (For example, a Doc experiment with a miniature rocket / missile proved to be part of a very small fish catching method.) The story unfolds as well, hitting the viewer with a small 'Camp' each so often, than to continue to remind us not to take it too seriously. We are also intrigued by the fact that George Pal is the producer (his last). He who was so known for special effects, a factor that could certainly be put to use in a sci-fi action scenario of Pulp's character world. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it very vividly. Ms. Ryan (Deanna) was at the hospital and had just given birth to our second child, Michelle (14/08/75). Our eldest daughter, Jennifer, was visiting her grandmother. After hours visiting the maternity ward, we went directly to the old Marquette Theater, 63rd & Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> After seeing And as I know Doc, I'm a little disappointed by the final product. I could accept a bit of this "camp" affair, but I would not have objected if Mr.Pal had seen fit to let it all drag along and have real dinosaurs and volcanoes ordered to give everything a little More Pulp / Comic / Series Exciting. <br /> <br /> And yet, the cast, led by Mr. Ely and the others, made the whole movie friendly, even lovable. The sets and locations were, to our knowledge, very similar to those of a 1930s soap opera or adventure movie, which would be nice for anyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what they were looking for. with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE.
