After seeing you've got mail and being disappointed, I decided to see the original movie that inspired this one, The Shop Around the Corner. I was surprised by this movie. It is a real gem and from that moment one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, if you have not seen it, I'd like to ask you to see it today. I am not against retouching and I sometimes like the new version more than the original version, but this time, I have to admit that you've got Got Mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Do not miss it, head over to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
