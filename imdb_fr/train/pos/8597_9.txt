I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that had never happened before: a secret service agent in bad shape and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison", they think that he is the mole but he is not. <br /> <br /> He's just a morally impetuous agent with an affair with the First Lady! Since he has done that, he is unable to give an acceptable polygraph examination, which makes him the number one suspect when it is revealed that there is a plot to kill the president. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" is obliged to continue the fire but at the same time, he always tries to do what is right in protecting the president. Douglas does an excellent job in this role. I do not always care about the people he plays with, but he's an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is just as good (at least here) as his fellow SS boss who tracks Douglas until he's convinced he's told the truth. When he does, they work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. Scammers are interesting, by the way. In addition, I have never seen - and I will not see it unfortunately - a First Lady as beautiful as Kim Basinger <br /> <br /> It is simply a seedy action movie that entertains end to end. Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a number of them, and a reason why you see so many critical comments. However, he is unjustly criticized here. It's just not smart enough for the geniuses here on this site. My advice: relax, just enjoy the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, there is a little Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise, there are good grades for entertainment ... that's what movies are.
