Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green !! Wow, what trio ... OK, so it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well interpreted by everyone. Even a few moments of "laughing out loud" mixed with fairly serious observations about fidelity, age-related prejudices and aging issues of parents / Alzheimer's. <br /> <br /> Original guitar music has also added to the story. <br /> <br /> While I've been a fan of Mrs. Annis 'since' Lillie '(in the' 70s) and Mr Kitchen since 'The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I only discovered recently Mr. Green ('Me and Mrs. Jones', 'Touching Evil', etc.), asking me the question - why did not I see 'Reckless' until recently? !! While it's more of a "chick movie" than what a man will sit on, it's perfect for lazy watching a rainy afternoon.
