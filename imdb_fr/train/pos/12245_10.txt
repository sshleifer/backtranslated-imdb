This is the best Emma that exists in my opinion. Having seen the other version (1996) which is also good and read the book, I think I can say without fear that this is the true interpretation and the most faithful to the masterpiece of Jane Austen. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is good too, it's just that it's almost like a different story. It is very light and fluffy, you do not see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a nice movie, it would do well, but the intricacies of some elements of the plot, such as the entanglement of Churchill / Fairfax much ignored to be virtually non-existent. But if you want the characters to be a little more fleshed out, more real and multidimensional, the TV version of 1996 is superior. Emma is a remarkable person, but she is imperfect. Kate Beckinsale is good at showing the little quirks of the character. You see her looking disgusted by some of Harriet Smith's simpler conversation, but she shows no remorse for ruining Harriet's proposal until this action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness. at the end. You see his narcissism and that mirrors that of Frank Churchill in that they would hurt others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​it was playing the matchmaker and having a new friend to pass the time after losing his housekeeper at the wedding. For Frank Churchill, ensuring the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and treating others abominably to keep the secret. In the book, she realizes all this in an awakening overwhelming to all her mistakes. Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse but that of Paltrow is more childish and stagnant, while the awakening of Beckinsale is rather real and serious and you see the transition from a selfish behavior of child to a kind and thoughtful adult . Both versions are very good but I prefer this one.
