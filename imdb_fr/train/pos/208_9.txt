The Sunshine Boys is a fantastic comedy about two ex-Vaudevillians who reluctantly meet for a televised special despite the scorn of the other. <br /> <br /> The comic genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting for the most stupid and ridiculous little things! The equipment is fast and witty, it will appeal to all ages. <br /> <br /> SWEET ALERT WITH SPOILER: There are some sad moments towards the end of the film that indirectly deal with the effects of aging that the film gives. a gentle, sincere tenderness that shows this critic that what they need most to succeed is one of the other. <br /> <br /> If anyone likes The Odd Couple, you'll love this movie. An excellent movie!
