My personal feeling is that you can not separate this movie from its political / historical background as so many (American) critics do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It's about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between east and west. Just like the guys are torn between Esther and all the others, and Esther is torn between the "Joe Tovarish" and the guys. In some situations, shame is lost for an audience that has never lived under Tito. I think the film is underrated and it's a pity we lost the director. Films like this give freedom a greater importance. It's not just "another film about the emergence of the majority in Eastern Europe" ... it's a sensitive portrait of teenagers walking on a fine line that could eventually lead them to a real freedom.
