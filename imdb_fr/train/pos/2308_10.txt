I watched this as an impulse while browsing the movie store and I could not have been more pleasantly surprised! My mother and I watched this movie together and enjoyed it very much. This is not the typical "chicks movie" with a love story and tears, but it really touches a nerve in the twist at the end. It is an end where, although unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film is not affected. I think that Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, which is in its infancy, and that it is really worth watching! I did not recognize many supportive actors, but they all play their supporting role well. "The man on the moon" is a credible story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time. Most women can really understand everything, from Witherspoon's words, her subtle looks and less subtle emotions (raging like a typical teenager). Although she plays a confused character about love, she does not seem so stupid and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies today.
