I thought it was an extremely intelligent movie. I was very happy and could not really ask for more. In fact, I own the film because I did not give it to someone ... which I should do, but I really want to keep it because I liked it. In addition, the fact that I do not own too many foreign films and this is a first. Personally, I love Finnish products, so it added to my pleasure. But overall, it's worth a look. However, if you are not ready to understand Finnish or read the text Subtitles, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10, of course.
