An exceptional 1943 film starring Paul Lukas giving an Oscar-winning performance as the head of his family, bringing them back from Europe to America as the Nazi threat deepened. <br /> <br /> The usual formidable Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for the best actress for this film or for any 1943 film. <br /> <br /> In Realizing the treachery around them, Lukas successfully solves the situation. He knows he has to return to Europe for a clandestine mission and he returns it. <br /> <br /> Davis shot again with Katharine Hepburn, who shed tears when they had to separate. Resolved, she knows that her eldest son must follow him on his path of freedom. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a bad enemy.
