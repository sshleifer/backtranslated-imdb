This documentary makes you travel all over the world. It contains rare and astonishing sequelae of nature. It shows how our planet can be diverse and fragile. The future of the polar bear is emphasized at the beginning and at the end of it. After all, its dark future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. This documentary, however, is a simplistic approach to such a serious environmental problem. It can nevertheless be easily seen by young children because it remains mainly descriptive. Scientists may well be disappointed because it is not a remake of Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient Truth", but frankly ... what a description !!! A question may arise: Is not it worth preserving the beauty of our world? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 such beauty still exists despite the various pollutions. By living in cities, we tend to forget that we are an integral part of this nature. All things considered, this documentary reminds us that we have a common treasure called "EARTH".
