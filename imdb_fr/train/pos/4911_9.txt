This film has become in the past ten years one of my favorite black pseudo experiences. The three sons of the story that Kazan has given us each have unique and distinct pleasures. The domestic talk between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between the pieces, the small gestures such as the phone book that Barbara places on the chair under his son so that he can reach the table, these little intimate exchanges between husband and wife are all well designed. and natural. I like more than anything about their porch, this second room where it is clear that they spend a big part of their summer. The second thread is the professional relationship between many people in the film, but especially between Widmark and Douglas characters. It may not be entirely original and it gets a bit windy, but in the end, it seems to be real, respectful and effective. The third thread, Blackie's grimy tale of her ragged little group, brings us closer to a dark, scary dark world. Blackie de Palance is as cold as a block of ice. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-taught man, has a complexity that we only use briefly. For me, this film continues to be a completely satisfying experience.
