When I heard about this movie, it was supposed to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. Yes, it was funny. I mean, I loved everything until the end where ........... Oh no, I can not tell you that you should do it yourself. It's funny except. The vulgar language. That's why I say if you like movies that are funny, look at it sexually, but if it does not, do not lose your money by renting or buying it.
