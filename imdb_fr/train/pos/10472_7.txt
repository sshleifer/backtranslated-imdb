Anyone who enjoys rheostatic music will enjoy this movie. I have some minor complaints, mainly about the stimulation and casting of some actors (not Maury) who are not really convincing in their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this movie or is considering watching it as it is on Canadian CBC television: The CBC version is like the version of Reader's Digest by WHALE MUSIC: do not look at it not. It cuts out entire scenes and secondary intrigues (if you can) of the film. The CBC, which presents most of the intact films, took half of WHALE MUSIC's courage. I do not know why. It's horrible what they did to the movie. Rent the video or watch it in a theater, but DO NOT watch it on CBC television.
