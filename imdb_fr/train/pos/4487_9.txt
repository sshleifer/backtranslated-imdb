"Fraidy Cat", the 4th of these caricatures, is a good one. At least I like that, so I'm surprised it's getting mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This one is more a macabre story than funny, even if it has its comedy moments. The atmosphere is dark and sinister. Suspense is another strong element here. When it comes to humor, it's mostly black humor. <br /> <br /> In this short film, Tom listens to a scary radio show at night and is absolutely terrified because it's all about ghosts, which he believes. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry watches everything and can not stop laughing all the time. In fact, Jerry is quickly finding a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner, he creates a big "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom experiences the most frightening experience of his life. Although Jerry scares Tom without good reason, the way the story is told ends up being funny. Plus, again, there's no violence here as it's one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I do not understand that this joke about Tom's 9 lives was lost in the vacuum. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally discovers that this was all Jerry's ploy and Jerry was ridiculed, Jerry is "caught with the hand in the cookie jar" (he deserves to be discovered) . Still, Tom shows incredible patience before reacting. He looks at Jerry angrily for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and takes about half a minute to understand that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a different, singular and remarkable Tom & Jerry experience.
