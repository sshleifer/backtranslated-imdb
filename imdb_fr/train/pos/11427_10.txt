I loved this movie because in my mind, it seemed to capture perfectly what I had imagined in the life of French colonial Africa in the 50s ("my" generation anyway). But I was really pleased with his quiet pace and the glorious end. In the last 5 minutes of this movie, you need to focus on what's going on. Never have I been so impressed by the "conclusion" of a film. I remember shouting "wow!" when I realized it was over. By cons, my two girls fell asleep on the couch!
