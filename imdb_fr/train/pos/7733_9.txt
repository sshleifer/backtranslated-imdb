The black quality of Foley in this intense and saturated pulpy film is akin to "perfectly". Film by film, edit by editing, the film takes place around a disturbed boxer who discovers his own goal (or lack thereof). Other comments may indicate a lack of interest in pulp, but I personally think it's a superbly prepared movie!
