... do not read the abstracts of the plot, because, in words, the plot may seem trivial, brain dead and useless. The film is great, the acting game Denzel and Dakota (she'll go to heaven, trust me) is just fabulous, and the plot is mind-blowing. In fact, "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on real facts and some characters are not fictional, which adds to the shock I had during and after the movie. If you like both actors and the movies a little disturbed, you still have not seen your favorite movie ... Trust me, you will have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is great, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... do not miss it
