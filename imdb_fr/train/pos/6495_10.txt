10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is to see absolutely, with extracts of war films that no one has seen for years, until it is projected in 1974. The film extracts of this documentary about the war are not missing anything, some of the clips left me stunned. The entire series has more than 20 episodes and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. It's simply the best documentary about the war and now over 25 years old is still able to carry a huge success. You have to watch this at some point, even if it's just a few episodes. You will still be blown away by the impact of this documentary on those who have lived there who have suffered and died on behalf of WAR, in a WORLD AT WAR.
