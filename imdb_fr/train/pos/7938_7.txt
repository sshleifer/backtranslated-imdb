Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and a bunch of kids who do not look like any of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, Rob and Josie get married one day with a shotgun during a drunken night while vacationing in Vegas. They go back home and discover that their respective children already know the wedding due to fodder not like a tabloid. Rob and Josie both take them with their eight children to one or the other's house. <br /> <br /> Rob builds furniture, quite close to the construction work of Frank Lambert (Patrick Duffy) the very same step by step that guarantees eternal mockery. <br /> <br /> Josie is a kind of queen who makes cookies, although she does not give the impression of making cookies. Not enough close to the work of Carol Foster's hairdresser (Suzanne Somers) to justify a simulacrum of resemblance, but ridiculous enough to justify a simulacrum of atrocity. <br /> <br /> Unlike Step by Step, they were a couple before the holidays and knew one. The family names of another, or at least the bad name if one is serious enough about a relationship to travel together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. Personally, I think they should have called the youngest Andrew 'Andy'. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of product placement, especially for soup by hand (which is disgusting) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also stupid and insane moments. Nor is it a good movie to promote happy families. <br /> <br /> But, hey! Rob Estes! This concludes my analysis of "Step by step ... on very bad drugs". Look at that for Rob Estes and his pretty ones! Eyes. There are beautiful pretty! Blows of eyes.
