A group of popular high school students make a cruel joke to Marty (Simon Scuddamore's friendly performance), which leaves him horribly disfigured. Five years later, the gang returns to high school, now in ruins and abandoned, for a meeting. Of course, an angry and vindictive Marty comes dressed in a jester costume to take a frightful revenge on his tormentors. Screenwriters / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale trot out all the captivating clich√©s that make these 80s sliding movies so entertaining: scary fears, Steadican blows, a fierce storm, a freaky crazy soundtrack hard-rock, a good dose of free nudity, a ridiculous "what the heck do we do?" Supernatural highlight, insignificant makeup f / x, and one of those adorably lame "everything was just a terrible dream" falsification of non-ends. In addition, the elaborate pieces of the assassination provide the gruesome goods: Gory in particular pointed out the belly of a man who explodes after drinking poisoned beer, a lady taking a bath of acid, a man crushed under a huge Tractor and two people electrocuted in the middle of having wild passionate sex. Caroline Munro, about thirty mermaids of British cult horror, hilariously misunderstands an American teenager in the first third of the film. The actors all show strong performances, with Carmine Iannaccone like Skip Pollack, leader of the smartalecks, Billy Hartman in the macho scarf Frank and Donna Yeager in the slut Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall is a funny cameo as Munro's sordid agent, Manny. The melodious and agitated music of Harry Manfredini shamelessly recycles his replicas of his "Friday the 13th" scores. Alan Pudney's fluid cinematography does the trick. Good, fun trash.
