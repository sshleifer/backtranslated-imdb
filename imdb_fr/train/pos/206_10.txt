I'm 14, so you'll probably think I've never heard of George Burns, Walter Matthau or anyone like that. My boy, are you wrong? I had heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Oscar for that. I've been a fan of George Burns since he was ten years old. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and I loved it. This one was also very great. George Burns did a great job. Walter Matthau too (this is the first time I see him play). And even though they had very small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. This special they filmed would have been great if it was really done. Let me tell you this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
