The film goes well, it has its moments, the musical scenes are the best! The soundtrack is a real classic. It's a perfect album, which starts with Let's Go Crazy (appropriate at the beginning, it's a very festive and very tempo song), Take Me With U (a fun and pop song ...), The Beautiful Ones (a Happy Ballad, probably the closest thing to R & B on this album), Computer Blue (an angry hymn to Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs of all time, she laughs very vaguely of Apolonia), When Doves Cry (the climax I would die 4 U, baby, I'm a star and, of course, Purple Rain (a real classic, a very good ending for this classic album). album are both very good, I highly recommend them!
