I thought it was one of the best suites I've seen in a while. Sometimes I felt like I just wanted someone to die, Stanley's murder of the boring characters was brilliant. It was a movie so well done that you were happy when so-and-so died. My only problem was that in some scenes, it seemed like someone with a home camera was filming and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Shiny film.
