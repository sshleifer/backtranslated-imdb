It's a really cool movie! I remember seeing it when I was very young and watching it all the time once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and it's really cool to see how they train the animals to do all those things. Some parts of the movie are sad though (like when Sassy, ​​the cat, falls into the waterfall and when Shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I saw the second Homeward Bound but I must say that this is not as good as the first. Shadow is smart, Sassy is good, Sassy, ​​and Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedies or talking animals. This is one of my ten favorite movies!
