This image is for me very appreciated, because it is an extremely pleasant and amusing parody of Alien Invaders taking control of a city and many of its inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The city and the players are all decked out in 1950s style and the entire movie has a deliberately sticky and kitschy feel. Some scenes are hilarious, like the birth of an alien creature. <br /> <br /> All the actors give serious and serious performances, which makes the film even more funny and the special effects. 3rd rate to add to the fun. <br /> <br /> This type of film is often worthy of worship: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
