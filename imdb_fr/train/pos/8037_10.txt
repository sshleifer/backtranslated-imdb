"One shot, one killed, without exception." Must see if you like marines or snipers. two big congratulations! Great story, good camera work, good drama, action, details and more. Pretty close to the real thing. But this is not a film to break down and to note mounting mistakes. it's to sit down and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth, but this movie is not really meant to make you think. it's about taking advantage of the lifestyle and action of the snipers. Sniper 2 and 3 are good follow ups but the first one remains the best movie. Tom Berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of sniper life. the plain of dealing with all the death. To see for sniper fans.
