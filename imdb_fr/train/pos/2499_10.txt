This movie was amazing. He had an original concept (that of a vampire movie and a Yakuza gang movie). It is a humorous and yet very tragic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and subtly comments society. On the part of Gackt Camui, Sho's role was perfectly interpreted and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as a humorous and tormented vampire, Kei. I also laughed and cried about the playful character, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this movie, especially moments like the fun scene of the cigarette, the scenes of fighting and, especially, the heartbreaking end.
