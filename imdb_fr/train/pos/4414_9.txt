Cuban Blood is one of those movies that sleep a lot on life in a very traditional way. In fact, I watched it while sailing around Cuba on a Western Caribbean cruise. He describes the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Little time is spent on revolution until the end, when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is about the boy's youth and the relationships that are born in a small town where everyone knows each other. There are powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A movie with a beautiful staging and staging. It's a film that tells a story without special effects, big projects or twists. It's a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and their triumphs. A good movie to watch several times a year.
