This is the first comment I wrote for IMDb so naked with me, but I caught this movie on HBO and I was really happy to watch it. Richard Gere is excellent in this movie as a passionate agent / detective who respects the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great and there is never a boring scene that slows the pace of the movie. Some parts of the movie that have to do with crazy sex addicts are quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to cope with the scenes very well. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you are looking for a good crime / suspense film, ignore the low note that this film has obtained on IMDb and look at it definitely.
